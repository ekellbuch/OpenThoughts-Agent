  "analysis": "I inspected the container environment to look for an existing MySQL installation or running server. Results of the checks: (1) current directory is /app and I'm root; (2) /app is empty; (3) /var/lib/mysql does not exist (no local MySQL data dir); (4) no mysqld/mysql processes are running; (5) mysql client is not present (mysql: command not found); (6) no Debian MySQL administrative config (/etc/mysql/debian.cnf) and no MYSQL_* environment variables. In short: there is no MySQL server or client available in this container right now, and there are no visible database files or credentials to connect to an external server.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL against a MySQL server until one exists or I have connection details to a remote server. Here are the realistic next options; tell me which you want me to perform or supply the connection info you want me to use:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL instance you provide: you must give host, port (optional), username, password (or a client config file), and database name. Once you supply them I will craft a single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block as you requested) and you will execute it and return the raw output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL-compatible server in this container so I can operate on it here. This requires installing packages (apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client) and initializing/starting the server. Note: installing packages needs network access and may take time; starting services in containers sometimes requires different steps (e.g., running mysqld_safe or invoking the server directly). If you choose this, I will run the install and initialization commands and then create a database/user as needed before running your SQL.\n\nOption C — If you have a SQL dump file or a directory with .sql or data files, upload or place it into /app (or tell me its path). I can import it after a server is available (see Option B) or help you run mysql client against a remote instance (Option A).\n\nIf you choose Option A, provide credentials and the exact question you want answered (what table/columns/filters/aggregations). If you choose Option B, confirm and I will proceed to install mariadb-server and mariadb-client and then initialize/start the server and create a user/database for use.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now with Option B (install local server), I will run these commands in order to prepare a usable local MySQL-compatible server:\n1) apt-get update\n2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\n3) service mysql start || mysqld_safe --skip-networking &\n4) mysql -u root -e \"CREATE DATABASE example_db; CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test'; GRANT ALL ON example_db.* TO 'test'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"\n\nAfter the server is up and a database/user exists, you will give me the SQL question and I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to run. I will not run any SQL until you instruct me to operate.\n\nWhich option do you want me to take? If Option A, paste the connection details and the question. If Option B, confirm and I will proceed to install/start a server.",
