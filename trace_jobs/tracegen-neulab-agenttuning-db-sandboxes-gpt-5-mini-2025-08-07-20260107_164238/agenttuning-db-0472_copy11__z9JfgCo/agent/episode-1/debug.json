Here are the realistic next options; tell me which you want me to perform or supply the connection info you want me to use:\\\\n\\\\nOption A \\u2014 Connect to a remote MySQL instance you provide: you must give host, port (optional), username, password (or a client config file), and database name. Once you supply them I will craft a single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block as you requested) and you will execute it and return the raw output.\\\\n\\\\nOption B \\u2014 Install and run a local MySQL-compatible server in this container so I can operate on it here. This requires installing packages (apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client) and initializing/starting the server. Note: installing packages needs network access and may take time; starting services in containers sometimes requires different steps (e.g., running mysqld_safe or invoking the server directly). If you choose this, I will run the install and initialization commands and then create a database/user as needed before running your SQL.\\\\n\\\\nOption C \\u2014 If you have a SQL dump file or a directory with .sql or data files, upload or place it into /app (or tell me its path). I can import it after a server is available (see Option B) or help you run mysql client against a remote instance (Option A).\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose Option A, provide credentials and the exact question you want answered (what table/columns/filters/aggregations). If you choose Option B, confirm and I will proceed to install mariadb-server and mariadb-client and then initialize/start the server and create a user/database for use.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want me to proceed now with Option B (install local server), I will run these commands in order to prepare a usable local MySQL-compatible server:\\\\n1) apt-get update\\\\n2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\\\\n3) service mysql start || mysqld_safe --skip-networking &\\\\n4) mysql -u root -e \\\\\\\"CREATE DATABASE example_db; CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test'; GRANT ALL ON example_db.* TO 'test'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter the server is up and a database/user exists, you will give me the SQL question and I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to run. I will not run any SQL until you instruct me to operate.\\\\n\\\\nWhich option do you want me to take? If Option A, paste the connection details and the question.
