  "analysis": "You are at a root shell inside a container (prompt: root@5744b492a2ce:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session. There's no information about a MySQL server or database schema provided yet, and you haven't asked a specific database question. Before I can run SQL against a MySQL instance, I need to discover whether MySQL is installed/running in this environment, locate any sockets/configuration, and obtain connection details (binary, version, running process, config with credentials if present). After that I will ask you for the database question or, if you provide it, I will prepare and run a single SQL statement as requested.",
  "plan": "I will: 1) confirm current working directory and user to ensure environment context; 2) list files in /app to see if project/db files are present; 3) check common MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) to see if a server data directory exists; 4) check running processes for mysqld to see if a server is running; 5) check mysql client version availability; 6) look for Debian/Ubuntu packaged credentials in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (often present in containers) and inspect environment variables for MYSQL_* settings. These steps will tell us whether we can connect to MySQL locally and what credentials to use. After these checks I will ask you for the specific question you want answered or, if you already have a question, I'll construct the first SQL statement (one-line in a SQL code block) to run against the database.",
