  "analysis": "I installed a MariaDB server and the mysql client in the container, started the server (via mysqld_safe fallback), and verified it is running. A test query mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. Summary of accomplished work: - mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) - mariadb-server installed - mariadbd started (mysqld_safe) - SHOW DATABASES returned the server's databases. What remains: I don't yet know what specific question you want answered using SQL. Per your requested workflow, for every round I must choose to either operate (produce one SQL statement in the required format) or answer (finalize). Before I can operate I need the specific question (which table/columns/conditions you want queried) or permission to run exploratory SQL operations (e.g., show tables in a specific database).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or to tell me which operation to run next. When you ask the question, I will: - Explain my reasoning and the SQL I plan to run. - If you want me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown ```sql``` code block). You will execute only that SQL (the first SQL block) and paste the raw MySQL output back. - After you return the output, I will parse it and continue (either produce another single SQL operation or give the final answer). If you want me to perform any exploratory SQL now (for example, list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, or run a specific query), tell me which one and I will produce the single SQL statement accordingly.",
