  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally: connecting to the local socket failed (ERROR 2002). There are no DB credentials or config files (/root/.my.cnf) and nothing is listening on port 3306. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP) or socket path, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password (and optionally a database name). Once you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (invasive):\n- If you confirm, I will install and start a local server and then connect as root. The commands I would run (one at a time) are:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n  3) service mysql start || systemctl start mariadb || mysqld_safe &\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- After the server is running I can produce the single SQL statement you request (in the required format) for you to run and return output.\n\nTell me which option you choose. If Option A, supply the connection details. If Option B, reply with explicit confirmation and I will proceed to install/start a local server.",
