  "plan": "You must choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Use an existing MySQL server: provide connection details (host or socket path, port if not 3306, username, and password; optionally a database). After you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: confirm you want this and I will run package install and start commands, then connect as root and run the SQL you request. This is more invasive and will take additional time.\n\nTell me which option you choose. If Option A, include the connection details. If Option B, reply with confirmation and I will proceed to install/start the server.",
