  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (started via mysqld_safe). The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). A connectivity test (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet. There are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf) and we're connected as root with no password to the local MariaDB instance. I cannot run any further SQL until you specify what you want queried or permit me to run an exploratory query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose the next action. Available options (pick one):\n\n- Show tables in a specific database: tell me the database name (example: mysql). I will explain the SQL I will run and then — following your required protocol — output exactly one SQL statement in the format you mandated (prefix \"Action: Operation\" then a single-line SQL in a markdown ```sql``` block). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\n- Describe a specific table: tell me the database.table (example: mysql.user). I will explain the SQL I will run and then output the single SQL statement in the required format.\n\n- Run a custom SELECT or other query: provide the exact query you want. I will explain the SQL and then output the single SQL statement in the required format.\n\n- Finalize with an answer (Action: Answer): if you already have the final answer, provide the exact array contents and I will emit the final Answer block as you specified.\n\nNote on workflow: when you ask me to operate I will (1) explain the intended SQL to you, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required pattern (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL inside a markdown ```sql``` code block). You will execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue. I will not run any SQL until you select an option and (if necessary) provide the database/table/query details.",
