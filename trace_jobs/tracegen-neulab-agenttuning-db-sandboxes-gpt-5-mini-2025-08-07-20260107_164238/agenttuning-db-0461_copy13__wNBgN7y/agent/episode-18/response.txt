  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a MariaDB server installed and started (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe). I verified connectivity by running mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet. There are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf) and nothing remote was connected to; we are operating on the local MariaDB instance as root with no password.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. You can choose one of the following actions:\n\n1) Exploratory queries I can run for you (I will explain and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format when you pick one):\n   - Show tables in a database (you must provide the database name). I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n   - Describe a table (you must provide database.table). I will run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n   - Run a custom SELECT (you must provide the desired query). I will run that SELECT as-is.\n\n2) Provide a final answer: if you already have the data for a final response, tell me and I will output Action: Answer with the Final Answer array per your required pattern.\n\n3) If you want me to continue exploring without guidance, say which exploratory command from (1) to run and I will produce the single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nNotes about execution: per your workflow, when I operate I will first explain the SQL I intend to run, then output exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block prefixed by \"Action: Operation\". You will execute only the SQL in that first SQL code block and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue. I will not run any SQL until you select an action and (if needed) provide the target database/table/query.",
