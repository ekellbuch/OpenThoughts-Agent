  "analysis": "From the terminal output: I'm root in /app. There are no files in /app. There's no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), and there is no MySQL/MariaDB server data under /var/lib/mysql or config under /etc/mysql. No mysqld process is running. So currently I cannot run SQL against any local MySQL server because the client is missing and no server appears to be present. To operate a MySQL database I need either a mysql client to connect to a remote server (if you provide connection details) or both client and a server locally. At minimum we should install a MySQL/MariaDB client so we can attempt connections.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) or fall back to mariadb-client if the default package isn't available. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed and show its version. 4) Attempt a basic non-interactive connection to localhost (SHOW DATABASES;) to detect a local server. If a local server isn't present or connection fails, I'll ask you for connection details (host, port, username, password) so we can run the SQL statements you request. Each command is chosen to either prepare the environment or verify that preparation succeeded.",
