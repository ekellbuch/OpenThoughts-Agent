  "analysis": "Current state: the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) in the container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (connection to /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock fails). No credentials or config files (e.g., /root/.my.cnf) were found, and nothing is listening on port 3306. Therefore I cannot run SQL against any database from this environment until either: (A) you provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, username, password or socket), or (B) you permit installing and starting a local database server inside this container.",
  "plan": "Await your choice of how to proceed. Two options:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password (and optionally a database name). After you provide them I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in the container (invasive):\n- If you confirm, I will install and start mariadb-server or mysql-server, initialize/secure it as needed, then connect locally and run SQL. This requires explicit confirmation.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option A\" and the connection details (host, port, user, password, optional database or socket), or\n- \"Option B\" to allow installation and startup of a local server in this container.\n\nOnce you choose and/or provide credentials, I will proceed and—when operating—output a single SQL statement per your required format.",
