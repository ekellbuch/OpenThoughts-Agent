  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose the next action. Options:\n\n1) You provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., a SELECT with conditions or which table/column to inspect). I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then — per your required workflow — produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute; you will run only that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\n2) If you want me to perform an exploratory query now, pick one of these and I will run it (but I will produce it as a single SQL statement for you to execute as per your rules):\n   - Show tables in a database (tell me which database). Example SQL: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n   - Describe a table (give database.table). Example SQL: DESCRIBE mysql.user;\n   - Run a custom SELECT (supply the SELECT statement).\n\nIf you pick an exploratory action I will first explain why and what I expect to see, then output the single SQL statement in the required format. For now I will not run any further shell or SQL commands until you tell me which option to choose.",
