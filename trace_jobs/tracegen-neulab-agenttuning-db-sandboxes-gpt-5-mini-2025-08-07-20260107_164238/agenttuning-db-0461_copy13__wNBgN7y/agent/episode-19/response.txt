  "analysis": "The container currently has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a MariaDB server installed and started (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe). I verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no application databases or tables inspected yet, and there are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf). I am connected as root without a password to the local MariaDB instance. No specific question or SQL operation has been provided by you yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify which single operation you want me to perform (per your workflow constraints). Choose one of the following and reply so I can proceed:\n\n- Show tables in a database: provide the database name (example: mysql). I will explain the SQL I will run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n- Describe a specific table: provide database.table (example: mysql.user). I will explain and then output the single SQL statement.\n- Run a custom SELECT or other query: provide the exact query you want (I will explain and then output the single SQL statement).\n- Commit a final answer (Action: Answer): if you already have the final response, provide the exact array of answers and I will output the final-answer block per your specified pattern.\n\nWhen you pick an action, I will first explain the intent and SQL, then (if you confirm) emit exactly one SQL statement in the format you required (prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL inside a markdown ```sql``` block). You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.",
