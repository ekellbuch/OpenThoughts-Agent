  "analysis": "Summary of current state: I installed the mysql client and mariadb-server in the container, started the server (via mysqld_safe fallback), and verified connectivity. A quick check returned the server's default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The server is running and ready to accept SQL. I do not yet know what specific question or query you want executed against the database. Per your workflow constraints, every time I operate I must output exactly one SQL statement in the specified format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\", with one SQL statement inside a markdown ```sql``` code block), and you will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste back the raw MySQL output.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the question you want answered or to permit me to run exploratory SQL. Options you can ask for (tell me which you want):\n- Show databases (already done, but I can run again).\n- Show tables in a specific database: I would run: Action: Operation ```sql SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; ``` (single-line SQL).\n- Describe a specific table: Action: Operation ```sql DESCRIBE your_database.your_table; ```\n- Run any custom SELECT/aggregate/query you request: Action: Operation ```sql SELECT ...; ```\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- The specific question you want answered (e.g., \"List all users in table users where active=1\" or \"What is the total sales per month in table orders?\"). I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then — if you confirm — produce the single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. OR\n- Request an exploratory command from the options above (e.g., \"show tables in database mysql\"). If you choose an exploratory command, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run and paste back the output.\n\nI will not run any SQL until you either ask a question or pick one of the exploratory actions. When you want me to operate, I will provide the single SQL statement as required. If you want me to proceed now with a specific exploratory query, tell me which one and I will produce the SQL statement in the exact format you mandated.",
