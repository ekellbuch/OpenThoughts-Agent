  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (connection to /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock fails). There are no DB credentials or client config files found (/root/.my.cnf is absent), and nothing is listening on port 3306. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your decision. You have two choices:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password (and optionally a database). After you provide them I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container (invasive):\n- If you explicitly confirm, I will run these commands to install and start a server and then connect locally:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n  3) service mysql start || systemctl start mariadb || mysqld_safe &\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- After the server is running I will produce the single SQL statement you require in the specified format for you to execute.\n\nTell me which option you choose. If Option A, include host, port (if nonstandard), username, password, and optional database or socket path. If Option B, reply with confirmation and I will proceed to install/start the server.",
