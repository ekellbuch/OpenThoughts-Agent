  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the next action. Please choose one of the following and provide any required details:\n\n- Option A (exploratory): Show tables in a database — tell me the database name (for example: mysql). I will explain the SQL I will run and then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\n- Option B (exploratory): Describe a specific table — provide database.table (for example: mysql.user). I will explain and then provide one SQL statement in the required format.\n\n- Option C (custom): Run a custom SELECT or other query — provide the exact SELECT or query you want. I will explain and then provide one SQL statement in the required format.\n\n- Option D (final): If you already have the final answer and want to commit it, provide the exact array of answers and I will output the Action: Answer block per your required pattern.\n\nWhen you pick an option, I will first explain the specific SQL I plan to run, then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as you mandated (prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL inside a markdown ```sql``` block). You will execute only that SQL (the first SQL code block) and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.",
