You must choose one of: (A) Provide connection details for a remote DB (host, port, user, password) if you want to connect elsewhere; or (B) Specify the SQL operation to run on the local MariaDB instance. If you choose B, pick one of these examples or provide your own: \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>\", \"DESCRIBE <database>.<table>\", or a custom SELECT query. I will then explain the intended SQL and — if you confirm — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. I will not execute any SQL until you tell me which operation to run.",
