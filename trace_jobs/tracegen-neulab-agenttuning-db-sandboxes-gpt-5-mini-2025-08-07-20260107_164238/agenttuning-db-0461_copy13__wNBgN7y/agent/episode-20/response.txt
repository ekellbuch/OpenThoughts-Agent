  "analysis": "You're at a shell in the container (root@4f4e190c4eb7:/app). I installed the mysql client and mariadb-server, started mariadbd (via mysqld_safe fallback), and verified connectivity. Running mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no application databases or tables inspected. I am connected as root with no password to the local MariaDB instance. No specific question or SQL operation has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or the exploratory operation you want performed. Per your workflow rules, when I operate I must (1) explain the intended SQL, then (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL inside a markdown ```sql``` block). After you execute that single SQL statement and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue.\n\nChoose one of these actions and provide any needed details:\n- Show tables in a database: tell me the database name (e.g., \"mysql\"). I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table: tell me database.table (e.g., \"mysql.user\"). I will run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n- Run a custom SELECT: provide the SELECT you want (I will run it as-is);\n- Finalize with an answer: if you already have the final answer, say so and provide the exact answer array and I will output the Action: Answer block.\n\nWhen you pick one, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then (if you confirm) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.",
