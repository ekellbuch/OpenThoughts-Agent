  "analysis": "So far: the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) in the container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (connecting to the socket failed earlier). No DB credentials or client config files (/root/.my.cnf) were found, and nothing is listening on port 3306. Therefore we cannot run SQL until either a remote DB connection is provided or a local DB server is installed and started. You did not supply connection details, so to proceed I will install and start a local MariaDB server in the container so we can run SQL locally.",
  "plan": "Install mariadb-server, start the MariaDB/MySQL service, wait briefly for it to initialize, then attempt a connection as root to run a simple discovery query SHOW DATABASES;. Commands:\n1) Install mariadb-server non-interactively (DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server) so the server is present.\n2) Start the server with service mysql start, falling back to systemctl start mariadb or mysqld_safe if needed.\n3) Pause briefly to let the server initialize.\n4) Run mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to confirm the server is running and list databases.\nI expect the install to take the longest time. After the SHOW DATABASES output is returned, we can continue with one SQL operation per your protocol.",
