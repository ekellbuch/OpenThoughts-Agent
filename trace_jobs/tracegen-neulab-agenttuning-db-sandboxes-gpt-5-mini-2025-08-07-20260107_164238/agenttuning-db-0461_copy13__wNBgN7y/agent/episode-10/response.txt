  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally — connecting to the local socket fails (ERROR 2002). No credentials or client config files (/root/.my.cnf) were found and nothing is listening on port 3306. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment until either: (A) you provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host/port/user/password or socket), or (B) you allow me to install and start a local database server inside the container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction which must be one of the two options below. Do not run any of the install/start commands until you explicitly choose Option B.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server (recommended):\n- You provide connection details: host (or IP) or socket path, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password (optionally database). After you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block). You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (invasive):\n- If you confirm, I'll run these commands (one at a time) to install and start a local server and then connect as root:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n  3) service mysql start || systemctl start mariadb || mysqld_safe &\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- After the server is running I can run the SQL you request (again, I will output exactly one SQL statement per your required format).\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option A\" and include connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password, optional database or socket path), or\n- \"Option B\" to allow installation and startup of a local server in this container.\n\nWhen you want me to produce SQL to execute, remember I will output exactly one SQL statement inside the first SQL code block (prefixed by \"Action: Operation\") as you requested.",
