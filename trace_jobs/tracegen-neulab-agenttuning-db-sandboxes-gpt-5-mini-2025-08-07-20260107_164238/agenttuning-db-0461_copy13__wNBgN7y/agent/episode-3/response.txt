  "analysis": "I checked the environment. The mysql client was not originally present, so I installed default-mysql-client successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running: attempts to connect to localhost failed with ERROR 2002 (can't connect to socket). There are no environment variables or /root/.my.cnf with credentials, and no process listening on port 3306. The filesystem has the client configuration fallback files under /etc/mysql (installed with the client), but no data directory (/var/lib/mysql) or socket was found. Therefore I cannot run SQL against any server from here until I either have connection details for a remote server or we install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will not perform any intrusive changes without your confirmation. You can choose one of the following paths:\n\nOption A — Use a remote/existing MySQL server (recommended if you have a DB elsewhere):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, and password (or indicate if socket or .my.cnf should be used). Optionally provide database name. Once you provide credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required markdown format) for you to execute; you will run it and paste the output, and we will iterate.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside the container (I will do this only if you explicitly allow it):\n- I will run apt-get install mariadb-server (or mysql-server) and initialize/start the server, then connect as root with an insecure temporary password or root without password (depending on init method). After the server is running I can execute the SQL you request. Installing and running a DB server in the container is more invasive and may take additional time.\n\nIf you choose Option B, here are the exact commands I plan to run (one-at-a-time, with your confirmation):\n1) apt-get update\n2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n3) (start the server) service mysql start || systemctl start mariadb || mysqld_safe &\n4) mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\nIf you choose Option A, provide the connection details and I will craft a single SQL statement in the format you required (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block). After you run it and paste back the output, I will continue.\n\nTell me which option you want (A: provide connection details, or B: allow installing a local server). If you pick B, confirm and I will proceed. If you pick A, give me host, port, user, and password (or indicate existing .my.cnf or socket path).",
