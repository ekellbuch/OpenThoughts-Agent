  "analysis": "The container now has a running MariaDB server (mariadbd) and the mysql client installed. A quick check returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific database or table has been inspected. I cannot run any SQL until you (A) give a specific question to answer or (B) request an exploratory SQL operation. Per your workflow, when I operate I must: explain the planned SQL and then output exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block prefixed with \"Action: Operation\". You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output, after which I will parse and continue.",
  "plan": "Tell me exactly which action you want next. Choose one of:\n\n- Option 1 (exploratory): Show tables in a database. Provide the database name (example: \"SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\").\n- Option 2 (exploratory): Describe a specific table. Provide the database.table name (example: \"DESCRIBE mysql.user;\").\n- Option 3 (exploratory): Run a custom SELECT query. Provide the exact SELECT you want (I will explain then emit the single SQL statement).\n- Option 4: You already have the final answer and want me to commit it (Action: Answer). If so, provide the exact final answer array.\n\nOnce you pick an option and (if needed) provide the database/table/query details, I will explain the SQL I will run and then — per your rules — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. I will not run any SQL until you choose.",
