  "analysis": "The container now has a running MariaDB server and the mysql client. I installed mariadb-server, started mariadbd (via mysqld_safe fallback), and verified with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet. I am ready to run SQL, but per your workflow I must either (A) produce exactly one SQL statement (in the specified markdown format) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or (B) provide a final answer if the question is completed. You have not yet given a specific question or requested a particular SQL operation to perform against the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the SQL operation you want. You can either:\n- Ask a specific question about the database (for example: \"Show tables in database X\", \"Describe table Y in database X\", or a SELECT query to retrieve particular data\"). I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then, if you confirm, produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL inside a markdown ```sql``` block) for you to execute. You will run only that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n- Or tell me to run an exploratory query now (examples I can run: SHOW DATABASES;, SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;, SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;, or DESCRIBE mysql.user;). If you pick one, I will produce the single SQL statement in the required format.\n\nWhen you request an operation, I'll follow your protocol precisely: first explain, then output a single SQL statement formatted as you mandated. Until you specify which operation to run, I will not run any further commands.",
