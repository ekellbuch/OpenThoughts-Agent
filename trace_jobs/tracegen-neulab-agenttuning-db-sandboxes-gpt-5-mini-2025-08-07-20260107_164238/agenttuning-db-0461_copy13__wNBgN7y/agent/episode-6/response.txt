  "analysis": "The environment has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally and no credentials or configuration files (/root/.my.cnf) were found. Attempts to connect to localhost failed with ERROR 2002 (no socket). I cannot run any SQL against a database from here until I either (A) receive connection details for an existing MySQL server (remote or socket) or (B) am permitted to install and start a local database server inside the container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction which must be one of these two choices:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have one):\n- You provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (and optionally database). After you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n  - I will output: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (```sql <single-line-SQL>; ```).\n  - You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside the container (invasive):\n- If you confirm, I will run package installation and start the server. Example commands I will run (one at a time) are:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n  3) service mysql start || systemctl start mariadb || mysqld_safe &\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- After the server is running I can proceed to run the SQL you request (again, I will output a single SQL statement in the required format for you to run and return output).\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option A\" and provide the connection details (host, port, user, password, optional database or socket), or\n- \"Option B\" to allow installation and startup of a local database server in this container.\n\nWhen you want me to execute SQL operations, remember I will provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the specified markdown format and you will execute only that SQL and return its raw output.",
