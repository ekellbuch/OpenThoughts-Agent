  "analysis": "We installed the mysql client successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running: attempting mysql -uroot failed with ERROR 2002 (can't connect to local socket). /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql did not exist earlier. To proceed we need either: (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password and optionally socket) so the client can connect and run SQL, or (B) install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server (more invasive). Before asking you for credentials, I should search the environment for any existing connection info (environment variables, config files like /root/.my.cnf, or any listening 3306 service) or sockets in non-standard paths. If I find connection info I can run a single SQL statement as you require; otherwise I'll ask you whether you want me to install a local server or provide remote credentials.",
  "plan": "1) Check environment variables for MYSQL or DB-related variables (may contain host/port/user/password). 2) Check for a MySQL client config file (/root/.my.cnf) that may include credentials. 3) Check whether any process is listening on port 3306 (remote/local server). 4) Search for possible MySQL sockets or config files on the filesystem. Based on the results: if credentials are found, I'll use the mysql client to run the single SQL statement you request. If no credentials/config are found, I'll prompt you to provide connection details or to confirm that I should install/initialize a local server. The commands below perform these discovery steps.",
