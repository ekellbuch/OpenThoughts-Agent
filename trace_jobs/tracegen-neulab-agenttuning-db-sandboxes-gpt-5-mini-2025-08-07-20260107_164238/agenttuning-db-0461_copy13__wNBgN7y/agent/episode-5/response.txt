Attempts to connect to localhost failed with ERROR 2002 (no socket). I cannot execute SQL against a database until either (A) you provide connection details for an existing server (host, port, username, password or socket), or (B) you permit installation and startup of a local database server inside the container.",
  "plan": "Provide two clear options so you can choose how to proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have one): You give me connection details (host or socket path, port if nonstandard, username, password, and optionally database). Once you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server inside the container: If you confirm, I will install mariadb-server (or mysql-server) and start it, then connect as root and run SQL per your instructions. This is more invasive and will take additional time.\n\nTell me which option you choose. If Option A, include credentials. If Option B, reply with confirmation and I will proceed and run the necessary install/start commands.",
