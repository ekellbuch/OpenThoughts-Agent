  "analysis": "You are in a shell on the container (root@4f4e190c4eb7:/app). No commands have been run yet in this session beyond the shell startup messages. I don't yet know whether the MySQL server is installed/running in this environment or what credentials are available. To operate a MySQL database I need to locate the mysql client, check whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running, find the socket or connection info, and then attempt to connect (likely as root with no password or with environment-provided credentials).",
  "plan": "1) Gather basic environment info (whoami, pwd, list files) to confirm current location and permissions. 2) Check for mysqld processes to see if a server is running. 3) Check for mysql client availability and its version. 4) Inspect typical MySQL filesystem locations (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) for sockets/config. 5) Attempt a non-interactive connection as root (no password) to run a simple SQL statement (SHOW DATABASES;) so I can see what databases are present. Based on the results I will report back and then, when you ask the specific question, I will perform the requested single-SQL-step operations following your interaction protocol.",
