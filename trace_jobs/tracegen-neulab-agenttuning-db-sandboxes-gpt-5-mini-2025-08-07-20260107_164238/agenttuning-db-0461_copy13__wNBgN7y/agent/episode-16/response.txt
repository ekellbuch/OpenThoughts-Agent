  "analysis": "The container currently has a running MariaDB server and the mysql client installed. I installed mariadb-server and started mariadbd (via mysqld_safe). A test command returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected. I cannot proceed to run any specific SQL until you (A) provide the exact question you want answered, or (B) permit me to run an exploratory SQL statement. You have not provided further instructions yet, so nothing more has been executed since the server came up.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of these actions. Tell me which one you want and I will follow your required protocol (explain then produce exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block prefixed by \"Action: Operation\"). Options (examples):\n\n1) Show databases (not necessary because done, but available):\n   SQL I would run: SHOW DATABASES;\n\n2) List tables in the mysql system database:\n   SQL I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n\n3) Describe the mysql.user table (to inspect users):\n   SQL I would run: DESCRIBE mysql.user;\n\n4) Run a custom SELECT (you specify table/database and columns/conditions):\n   SQL I would run: SELECT ...;\n\n5) If you want a final answer (Action: Answer), state the answer contents and I will output the final Answer block as you specified.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and, if applicable, provide the database/table/columns/conditions or remote connection details (if you want to connect elsewhere). Once you confirm which operation to run, I will: (a) explain the single SQL statement I'm about to execute, and (b) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. I will not run any SQL until you confirm the desired action.",
