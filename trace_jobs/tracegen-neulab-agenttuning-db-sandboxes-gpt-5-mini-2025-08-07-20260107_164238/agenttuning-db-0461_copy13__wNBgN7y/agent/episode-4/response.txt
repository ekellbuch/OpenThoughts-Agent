  "analysis": "Current state: the mysql client is installed in the container (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally and there are no credentials or config files present. Attempts to connect to localhost fail with ERROR 2002. I cannot run any SQL against a database until I either connect to a remote server with credentials you provide or install and start a local server inside this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice. You can choose one of two safe options:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing (remote or local) MySQL server: provide connection details (host or socket path, port if nonstandard, username, and password). If you provide these, I will produce the single SQL statement you want in the exact format you required (Action: Operation with one SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside the container: confirm you want this. If you confirm, I will run package installation and start the server, then connect and run the SQL statements you instruct. This is more invasive and may take additional time.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A and the connection details (host, port, user, password, optional database), or\n- Option B to allow me to install and start a local server.\n\nWhen you want me to execute SQL, remember I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block preceded by \"Action: Operation\" as you specified. You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the output.",
