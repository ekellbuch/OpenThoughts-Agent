  "analysis": "Currently I'm in a minimal container at /app. No MySQL server is running (no mysqld process), there's no MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and no runtime socket (/var/run/mysqld). The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). No MySQL-related environment variables are set. To operate a MySQL server or run SQL I need a MySQL client (or a connection to a remote server).",
  "plan": "1) Identify the OS so I choose the correct package manager. 2) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so I can connect to a server or run SQL. 3) Verify the mysql client is available. If installation fails or there's no network, I'll report back and ask for connection details or an existing server. Commands: (a) show /etc/os-release to detect distro, (b) apt-get update, (c) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, (d) mysql --version to confirm installation.",
