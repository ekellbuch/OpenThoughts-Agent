There's no evidence yet whether MySQL server or client is installed or running.

  "plan": "I'll run a small sequence of non-destructive diagnostic commands to detect MySQL server/client presence and discover runtime state and socket/datadir locations. Specifically:\n1) List the current directory to see any application files.\n2) List running processes to check for mysqld.\n3) Check mysql client version if present.\n4) Inspect typical MySQL data and runtime directories (/var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld or /var/run/mysql).\n5) Check environment variables for any MySQL-related credentials or connection info.\nThese commands will produce the information I need to form the next SQL to run or to attempt a connection.",
