  "analysis": "So far I've inspected the /app directory (it's empty) and checked for a local MySQL data dir (/var/lib/mysql) — it does not exist. No mysqld process is running, there are no MySQL-related environment variables, and the 'ss' tool is not available. That means there's no local MySQL server process detected in this container. To proceed I need to determine whether a MySQL/MariaDB client is available and whether any MySQL configuration, socket, or client utilities exist that would let me connect to a local or remote server. I also should search typical config directories for my.cnf or sockets that point to a server.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether a MySQL client binary is present (which mysql, mysql --version). 2) Inspect common config and runtime dirs (/etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld) for configs or sockets. 3) Look for my.cnf files. 4) Search for any .sql files or other DB artifacts that might contain data. Based on these results I'll know whether I can connect locally or must ask for connection details (host, port, user, password) or whether a database file (e.g., sqlite) is present instead. I'll run each command to discover presence of client/configs. Commands will be short and exploratory.",
