  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside the container at /app. No MySQL commands have been run yet. There is no information about a running MySQL server, credentials, or database files in the terminal output. To proceed I need to discover whether MySQL/MariaDB is present and running, find its socket or port, and locate any database files or configuration that contain credentials. After that I can connect with the mysql client and run SQL statements as you request.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory (/app) to look for database files or config. 2) Check /var/lib/mysql for database files. 3) Check running processes for mysqld to see if a server is running. 4) Check listening TCP sockets for port 3306. 5) Dump environment variables that mention MYSQL to find credentials. Based on results I'll attempt to connect or ask you for the next question. Each command is exploratory and short.",
