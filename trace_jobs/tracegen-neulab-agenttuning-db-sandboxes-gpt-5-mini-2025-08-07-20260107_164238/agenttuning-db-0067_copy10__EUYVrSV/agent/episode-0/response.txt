  "analysis": "You are in a root bash shell inside a container (prompt: root@2e5ea901f6a8:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session. The environment shows the typical 'no job control' message for this non-interactive shell. The task expects me to operate a MySQL database by issuing SQL statements later, but first I need to discover whether a MySQL server and client are present and how to connect (socket, port, credentials). Nothing about the database state is known yet.",
  "plan": "I will: 1) Check for running MySQL/MariaDB processes to see if a server is running. 2) Inspect common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld and /etc/mysql) for sockets and config. 3) Check if the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). 4) Inspect environment variables for MYSQL* or DB-related credentials. 5) Check listening sockets for a process on port 3306. Based on these results I'll know how to connect (socket vs TCP) and whether I can proceed to run SQL. Each command is quick; I'll keep short durations.",
