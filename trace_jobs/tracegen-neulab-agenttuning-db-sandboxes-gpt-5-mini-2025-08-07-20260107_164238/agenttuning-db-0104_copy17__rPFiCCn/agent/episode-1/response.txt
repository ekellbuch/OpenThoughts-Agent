  "analysis": "The container /app is nearly empty and the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). We have no information about a running MySQL server or its credentials. To proceed with SQL operations we need a MySQL client available in the environment. The next step is to detect the container's package manager and install a MySQL client (or MariaDB client). After installation we can attempt a non-interactive query (SHOW DATABASES;) as root to discover databases and proceed from there.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect OS release to know the distribution. 2) Probe for available package manager (apt-get, apk, yum, zypper). 3) Run a small conditional installer that uses the available package manager to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (apt-get -> default-mysql-client, apk -> mariadb-client, yum -> mariadb or mariadb-client, zypper -> mariadb). 4) Verify installation with mysql --version. 5) Run a simple SQL statement to show databases: SHOW DATABASES;. If installation fails (no network or no package manager), we'll then inspect running processes and sockets to see if a server exists locally.",
