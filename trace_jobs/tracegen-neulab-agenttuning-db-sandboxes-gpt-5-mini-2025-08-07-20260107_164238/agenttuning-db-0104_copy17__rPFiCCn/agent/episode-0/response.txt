  "analysis": "You are in a container shell at /app as root. The terminal shows only the shell prompt and no previous commands. There's no current information about MySQL availability, credentials, or database files. To proceed I need to detect whether a mysql client is present and then try a simple non-interactive query (SHOW DATABASES) to learn what databases exist and whether root can connect without a password. If the client is missing or the server is unreachable, we'll get error output and then adjust (install client or inspect mysql server process/socket).",
  "plan": "1) List files in /app to see any project or DB-related files. 2) Check whether a mysql client binary exists (which mysql) and its version. 3) Attempt a quick non-interactive query using the root user to list databases: SHOW DATABASES;. This will tell us if the client can connect and what databases are present. If the connection fails, we'll inspect MySQL server processes and sockets next (not yet executed).",
