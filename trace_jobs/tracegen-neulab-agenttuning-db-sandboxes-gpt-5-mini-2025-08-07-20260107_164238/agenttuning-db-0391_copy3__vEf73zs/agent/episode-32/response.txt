  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. No MySQL server is present or running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and you have not supplied any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). All environment discovery and client installation steps have been completed; no SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server or provided connection info.",
  "plan": "I cannot execute SQL until you choose one of two clear paths. Please pick exactly one and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing (remote or local) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block. You will run only that SQL (the first SQL code block) and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install & start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server', and whether to set a root password (provide it) or initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will run the install and startup steps (I will show the exact commands before executing). Note: because the container may lack systemd, startup may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly. After the server is running, provide the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\nWhen you supply the connection details and the SQL question (Option A) or confirm server install + password choice (Option B), I will proceed. Remember: per your rules, every SQL I give to be executed will be exactly one statement in a single Markdown SQL code block preceded by 'Action: Operation'.",
