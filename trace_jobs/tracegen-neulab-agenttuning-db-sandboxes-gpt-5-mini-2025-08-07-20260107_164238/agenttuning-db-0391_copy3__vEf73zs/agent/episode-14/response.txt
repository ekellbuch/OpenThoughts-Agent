There is no MySQL server running or present (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket) and you have not provided any database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). Nothing further has been executed since the client install; no SQL statements have been run because there is no reachable server.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server along with the SQL question you want executed, or (B) confirm you want me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or note if passwordless auth), and database name (if applicable), plus the exact question you want answered.\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. You must run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; I will analyze it and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install & start a local server here (I will only run these commands after you confirm):\n- Confirm which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also tell me whether you want a root password set (and if so, provide it) or whether to initialize with no root password (insecure) so we can connect as root without a password.\n- If you confirm installation, I will run the following commands (I list them here so you can review; I will not execute anything until you confirm):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server\n     - Installs the MySQL server packages.\n  3) (If system service works) service mysql start  OR (if no systemd) run a manual initialization/start sequence:\n     mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld && chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld\n     mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql\n     mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n     sleep 3\n     mysql --protocol=socket -uroot -e \"ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"  (only if you requested setting a password)\n  4) Verify server is listening and reachable: mysql -uroot -pYOUR_PASSWORD -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n- After the server is running and reachable, give me the database/question and connection details (if credentials differ), and I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\nPlease reply with one of the following:\n- Option A + the connection details and the SQL question; OR\n- Option B + which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and what it should be).",
