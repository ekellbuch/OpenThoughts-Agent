  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt inside the container (root@f183150768af:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session. The task flow requires me to operate a MySQL database using SQL when you ask a question; before issuing SQL I must ensure I can connect to a MySQL server and find credentials or a socket. Right now I don't know if a MySQL server is present, whether the mysql client is installed, or what credentials/socket to use. I need to discover the MySQL client availability, running mysqld process, listening port/socket, and any local client config files that might contain credentials (e.g., /root/.my.cnf).",
  "plan": "1) Check if the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). 2) Check whether a mysqld server process is running (ps aux | grep [m]ysqld). 3) Check for a listening MySQL TCP port (3306) with ss or netstat. 4) List /var/run/mysqld for a socket file. 5) Look for local MySQL client config files that might include credentials (/root/.my.cnf and /etc/mysql/my.cnf). These steps will tell me how to connect (socket vs TCP) and whether credentials might be available. After these checks, I'll ask you the DB question or, if you already provided it, I'll construct the SQL and then produce the required single-statement SQL in the prescribed format.",
