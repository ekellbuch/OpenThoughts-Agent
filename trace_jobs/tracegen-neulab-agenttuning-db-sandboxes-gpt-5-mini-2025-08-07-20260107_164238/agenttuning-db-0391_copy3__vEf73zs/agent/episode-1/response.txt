  "analysis": "From the previous commands I can see there is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, no typical MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld), and no /root/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf. The environment currently does not show an available MySQL server or client. To proceed I need to discover whether a MySQL server exists anywhere on the filesystem (sockets, data dirs), whether connection info is present in environment variables, and whether a package manager is available so I can install a client if needed.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the OS release to know the distribution. 2) Check environment variables for any MySQL-related connection info. 3) Search the filesystem for mysql.sock and common mysql directories (like /var/lib/mysql) to see if a server was installed but not running. 4) Check which package manager (apt-get, yum, apk) is available so we can install a MySQL client if no client exists. After these checks, I'll either (a) connect to a local socket or TCP port if a server is found and credentials are available, or (b) attempt to install a MySQL client and then connect to a remote server (if you provide host/credentials) or further explore. If you want me to run SQL after this discovery, ask the question and I'll produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line markdown code block format.",
