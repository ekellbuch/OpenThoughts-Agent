There is no MySQL server currently running or available in the container (no mysqld process, no /var/run/mysqld, no /var/lib/mysql). You have not provided any database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). Because of that, I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of the following so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details and the SQL question:\n- Give me the database question and connection credentials (host, port, user, password, and optional database name or socket). I will then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your requirements (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request the next operation or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- If you instruct me to, I will install a server package (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and start it. I will show the exact commands I will run before executing them. Note: starting a server in this container may need manual startup (no systemd) and you may need to provide or accept a root password or allow unsecured local connections.\n\nTell me which option you choose and (if Option A) provide the connection details and the question you want answered. If you choose Option B, confirm which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to initialize a default root password or allow passwordless local root access.",
