  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). No MySQL server was found or running earlier (no mysqld process, no socket, no /var/lib/mysql). I currently have no connection details (host/port/user/password/database) or a database question from you, so I cannot run any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me one of two things so I can proceed:\n1) Provide the database question plus connection details (host, port, user, password, and optional database name or socket). If you give these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either ask for another operation or give the final answer.\n2) Tell me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container. If you choose this, confirm and I will install the server package and attempt to start the server so we can run SQL locally (I'll provide the exact commands I will run before executing them). Note: starting a server in a minimal container may require manual startup commands instead of systemd.\nWhich do you prefer? If you choose option 1, please include the database question and connection credentials.",
