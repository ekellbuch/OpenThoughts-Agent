  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no MySQL server present or running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld/mysql.sock was found earlier). You have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). All discovery steps and the client installation have been completed; no SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server or connection information.",
  "plan": "I cannot execute SQL until you choose one of two paths. Please pick exactly one and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze that output and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'). Also indicate whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will run the install and startup steps (I will show the exact commands I will run before executing them). Note: because this container may lack systemd, starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly.\n\nOnce you choose an option and provide the required details (for Option A: connection info + question; for Option B: server choice + root password preference), I will either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute or proceed to install and start a local server as requested.",
