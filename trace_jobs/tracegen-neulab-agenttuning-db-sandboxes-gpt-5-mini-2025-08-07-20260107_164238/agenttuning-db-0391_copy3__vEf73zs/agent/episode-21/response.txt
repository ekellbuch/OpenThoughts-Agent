  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. I have already inspected the environment and installed the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server present or running in the container (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and no local MySQL client config with credentials was found. Because there is neither a reachable server nor any connection credentials or a SQL question provided by you, no SQL has been or can be executed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear next steps so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also tell me whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will run the necessary apt-get install and manual startup steps (I will show the exact commands before executing). After the server is running, you will tell me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\nNotes about execution and SQL format:\n- Per your rules, whenever I provide SQL it will be exactly one SQL statement in a single Markdown SQL code block and nothing else. Only the first SQL code block I provide in a round will be executed by you.\n- After you run that statement and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another single SQL operation or commit the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus the connection details and the SQL question; OR\n- Option B plus which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and the password if you want it set).",
