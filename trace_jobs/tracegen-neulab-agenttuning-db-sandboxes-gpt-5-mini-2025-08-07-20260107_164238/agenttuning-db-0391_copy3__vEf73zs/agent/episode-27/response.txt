  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at root@f183150768af:/app#. The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld/mysql.sock was found earlier, and no local MySQL client config with credentials exists. I cannot run any SQL because there is no reachable server and you have not provided any connection credentials or a SQL question.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear next steps. Do one of the following and reply with the requested details:\n\nOption A — Use an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the SQL question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL operation in the required format: a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. You must run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; I will analyze it and then either request the next operation or provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will show the exact apt-get and startup commands I will run before executing them (note: this container likely lacks systemd, so startup may require manual initialization and running mysqld_safe/mysqld directly). After the server is running, tell me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\nNotes about behavior and formatting (important):\n- Per your rules, every time I provide SQL it will be exactly one statement in a single Markdown SQL code block and nothing else. Only the SQL in the first SQL code block I provide will be executed by you.\n- If you choose Option B and want me to proceed, I will list the exact commands I'll run (apt-get install, initialization, startup) and then execute them after you confirm. If you choose Option A, send the connection details and the SQL question now.\n\nExamples of commands I would run after you confirm (I will not run them until you explicitly confirm):\n- To install a server: apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-server\n- If systemd is not available: mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld && chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld; mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql; mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n- To test connection after startup: mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus: the connection details and the SQL question you want executed; OR\n- Option B plus: which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and the password if you want it set).",
