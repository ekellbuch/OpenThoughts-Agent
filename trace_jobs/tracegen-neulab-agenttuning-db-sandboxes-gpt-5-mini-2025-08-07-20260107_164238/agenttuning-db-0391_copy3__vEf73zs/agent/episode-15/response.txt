  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container that has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket discovered). You have not supplied any database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database), so I cannot execute SQL against any server yet. All discovery steps and client installation have been completed.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear next steps so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Use an external/remote MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide the database question and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm whether to install 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also tell me whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will run the install and startup commands. Because this container may lack systemd, I will either start the server via the service command or run mysqld_safe/mysqld manually and initialize the data directory. After the server is up I will ask which database/question to operate on and then produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\nPlease reply with one of the following:\n- Option A plus: the connection details and the SQL question to run; OR\n- Option B plus: which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and what it should be).\n\nI will not run any further commands until you choose one of the above and provide the required details.",
