There is currently no MySQL server running in the container and no local socket or data directory was found earlier. I cannot run SQL against a database until you either (a) provide connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (b) instruct me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container. No SQL has been executed yet because you haven't provided a database question or connection info.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the database question and connection details, or tell me to install and start a local server. Specifically: \n- If you provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database), I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. \n- If you want a local server, I will install and start it (I will request confirmation because starting a server may require additional steps). \nTell me which of these you prefer and also give the SQL question you want answered.",
