  "analysis": "You're in an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket) and you have not provided any database question or any connection credentials. All discovery steps and client installation are complete; no SQL statements have been executed because there is no reachable server or connection info.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of two paths. Please pick exactly one and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing (remote or local) MySQL server:\n- Provide the exact database question you want answered plus full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown SQL code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also indicate whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will (before executing anything) show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will run (note: container may lack systemd so startup may require manual initialization and running mysqld_safe or mysqld). After the server is running, give me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to execute.\n\nWhich option do you choose? If Option A, paste the connection details and the question now. If Option B, confirm server choice and root-password preference and I will show the exact commands I'll run before proceeding.",
