  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (root@f183150768af:/app#). The MySQL client was installed earlier (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket found) and no connection credentials or SQL question have been provided. All discovery and client-install steps have been completed; no SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server or connection information.",
  "plan": "I cannot execute any SQL until you choose one of two options. Tell me which you want and provide the necessary details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown SQL code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install & start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will run (I will not execute them until you confirm). Note: because this container may lack systemd, starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and starting mysqld_safe or mysqld directly. After the server is running, give me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (Option A or Option B) and the requested details so I can proceed. I will not run further commands until you provide that.",
