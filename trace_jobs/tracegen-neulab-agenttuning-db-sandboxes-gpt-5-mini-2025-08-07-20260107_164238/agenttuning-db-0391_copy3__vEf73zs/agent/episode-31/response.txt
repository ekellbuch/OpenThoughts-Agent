  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (root@f183150768af:/app#). The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and no connection credentials or SQL question have been provided. All discovery steps and client installation were completed earlier and no SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server or connection info.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you choose one of two clear options. Please reply with exactly one of these and include the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the SQL question you want answered plus full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable). \n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze that output and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will present the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will run and then execute them after your confirmation. Note: starting a server in this container may require manual initialization and running mysqld_safe/mysqld directly because systemd might be unavailable.\n\nImportant: When you want me to run SQL, I will output exactly one SQL statement per your rules (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). Only the SQL in the first code block will be executed by you. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will proceed with the next step.",
