There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket discovered), and you have not provided any database question or connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). With no server and no connection info I cannot execute SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two paths so I can continue:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing server (recommended): Provide the database question plus connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the target database name (if any). Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output, and I will analyze it and either request the next operation or give the final answer.\n\nOption 2 — Install and run a local server here: Confirm whether you want mysql-server or mariadb-server installed and whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access. If you confirm, I will (before running anything) show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will execute to install and start the server in this container. After the server is running, tell me the database/question and I will produce the single SQL statement to run.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the necessary details (for Option 1: connection credentials and the SQL question; for Option 2: server choice and root password preference).",
