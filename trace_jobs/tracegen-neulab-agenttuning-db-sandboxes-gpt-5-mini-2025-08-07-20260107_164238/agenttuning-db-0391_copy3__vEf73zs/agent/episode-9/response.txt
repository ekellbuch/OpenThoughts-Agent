You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). With no server and no connection info, I cannot run any SQL.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server: Provide the database question plus connection details (host, port, username, password, and optional database name or socket). Once you provide those I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run. You will run it and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server here: Confirm whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server and whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access. If you confirm, I will (before running anything) show the exact apt-get commands I will execute to install and start the server. After the server is running, you can tell me the database/question and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (for Option A: connection credentials and the question; for Option B: server choice and password policy).",
