There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no /var/lib/mysql) and you have not provided any database question or connection credentials. Without a server or connection info I cannot execute SQL. Previous exploration steps (checking for client, server, sockets, config) have been completed.",
  "plan": "You need to choose one of two paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide the database question and connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and target database name (if any). \n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and either request another operation or deliver the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.\n\nOption 2 — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access. Note: starting a server in a minimal container may require manual startup commands (no systemd). If you confirm, I will run the apt-get install and start commands and then ask which database/question to operate on.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details. If you choose Option 1, include the exact connection credentials and the SQL question. If you choose Option 2, confirm server choice and password policy and I will proceed (I will show the exact commands before executing them).",
