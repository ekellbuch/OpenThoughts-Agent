  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). No MySQL server is present or running: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no local MySQL config with credentials was found. You have not provided any database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database), so no SQL can be executed yet. All discovery and client installation steps have been completed.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of two paths. Please reply with one of the following and include the requested details: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and database name (if applicable). \n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block). You will run that SQL (only the first SQL block will be executed) and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze that output and continue with further operations or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install & start a local server here:\n- Tell me which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server', and whether to set a root password (provide the password) or initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure). \n- If you confirm, I will show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will run (because this container may lack systemd, I may need to initialize the data directory and start mysqld manually). After the server is running, give me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\nNote: Per your rules I will always provide SQL as exactly one statement inside a Markdown code block following the line 'Action: Operation'. After you run that statement and supply the raw MySQL output, I will proceed. If you want me to proceed now, reply with Option A plus connection details and the SQL question, or Option B plus the server choice and password policy.",
