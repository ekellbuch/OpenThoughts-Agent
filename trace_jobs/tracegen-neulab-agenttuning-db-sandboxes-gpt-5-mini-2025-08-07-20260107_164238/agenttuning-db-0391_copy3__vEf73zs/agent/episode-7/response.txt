You have not supplied any database question or connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). With no server and no connection info, I cannot execute any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths:\n\n1) Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have one): Provide the database question plus connection details: host (or socket), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the target database name (if any). Once you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and either request another operation or give the final answer.\n\n2) Install & run a local server in this container: Confirm you want me to install a server (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and state whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access. If you confirm, I will show the exact apt-get commands I will run to install and start the server (note: starting a server in a minimal container may require manual startup steps without systemd). After the server is running, I will ask which database and question to operate on and then produce the single SQL statement as above.\n\nPlease pick option 1 or 2 and supply the necessary details (for option 1: host, port, user, password, database, and the SQL question; for option 2: which server to install and root password preference).",
