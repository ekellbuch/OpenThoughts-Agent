  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. No MySQL server is present or running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket found earlier). You have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is neither a reachable server nor connection details, I cannot execute any SQL at this time.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear next steps so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze that output and either provide another single SQL operation or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (provide it) or initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I'll run (I won't execute them until you confirm). Note: this container may lack systemd, so starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe/mysqld directly.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus: the connection details and the SQL question; OR\n- Option B plus: which server to install and the root-password preference.\n\nI will not run further commands until you provide one of the above choices and the required details.",
