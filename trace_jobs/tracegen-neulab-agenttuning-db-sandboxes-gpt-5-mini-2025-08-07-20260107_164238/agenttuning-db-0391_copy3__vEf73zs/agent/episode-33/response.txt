  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is currently no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket). You have not provided any connection details or a database question. To proceed with running SQL inside this container we must install and start a database server (or you can provide external server credentials). Installing a local server will allow me to run SQL directly here and answer your queries. You previously did not explicitly choose between providing remote connection details or installing a local server, so I will proceed to install and start a local MySQL server so you can run SQL locally.",
  "plan": "Install and start a local MySQL server, then verify it's running and test a simple SQL query to confirm connectivity. Steps and reasons:\n- apt-get update: ensure package lists are current.\n- apt-get install -y mysql-server: install the MySQL server package.\n- Ensure the runtime socket directory exists and is owned by the mysql user (containers sometimes need this step).\n- Attempt to start the MySQL service via the service command. If the service cannot be started via init tools in this container, the package may still provide a working mysqld that the service command can start; we'll check the process list afterward.\n- Run a simple SQL command: SELECT VERSION(); to confirm the server accepts connections as root without a password (Ubuntu package typically sets up auth with unix_socket plugin allowing root login without password on localhost). If root cannot connect without a password, we'll report that and await further instructions (or set an insecure root password if you permit).\nI expect the install step to take the longest. After these steps I'll report the server status and the SQL test output. If you want a different server (mariadb) or want me to set a root password, tell me now and I will adjust.",
