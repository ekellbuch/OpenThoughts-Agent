  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (root@f183150768af:/app#). The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully earlier. There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and no connection credentials or SQL question have been provided by you. Because there is neither a reachable server nor connection info, no SQL has been (or can be) executed yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you choose one of two options. Pick exactly one and provide the needed details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will run (I will not execute anything until you confirm). Note: this container may lack systemd, so starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly.\n\nImportant notes about SQL formatting (per your rules):\n- Whenever I provide SQL to be executed it will be exactly one SQL statement inside a single Markdown SQL code block and preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. Only the SQL in the first SQL code block I provide will be executed by you. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze and continue.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus the connection details and the SQL question; OR\n- Option B plus which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and the password if you want it set).\n\nI will not run any further commands until you choose one of the above and provide the required details.",
