  "analysis": "This environment is Ubuntu 24.04 and currently has no MySQL client or server installed or running. The mysql binary is not present, no mysqld process or socket was found, and there are no local MySQL config files with credentials. apt-get is available, so I can install a MySQL client to allow connecting to a MySQL server (local or remote) once you provide connection details (host, port, user, password) or if a server is started here later.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package so we can run SQL against a MySQL server. 2) Verify the mysql client is installed. After the client is installed, I'll wait for you to provide the database question and any connection details (host/port/user/password or socket). Once you provide the connection info and the question, I'll produce a single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. Commands to run: update package lists, install default-mysql-client, verify mysql --version.",
