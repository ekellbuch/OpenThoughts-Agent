  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container where the MySQL client has been installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is currently no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket discovered earlier). You have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is neither a reachable server nor connection info, I cannot execute any SQL against a database right now. All discovery and client-installation steps have already been completed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear paths. I will not run any commands until you confirm which path and provide any needed details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- You provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or note if passwordless auth is used), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze that output and either ask for the next single SQL operation or give the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Install & start a local server in this container (if you want me to set up a local DB here):\n- Tell me whether to install 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server', and whether you want a root password set (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will run the install and startup steps. Because this container may not have systemd, the manual startup sequence I would run (with your confirmation) is roughly:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server  (or mariadb-server if you prefer)\n  3) mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld && chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld\n  4) mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql   (only if data dir not initialized)\n  5) mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n  6) sleep 3; mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"  (or set root password if requested)\n- After the server is running, tell me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\nNotes about the SQL step (must follow your rules):\n- Every time I produce SQL to be executed it will be exactly one SQL statement, in a single Markdown SQL code block, preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. Only the first SQL block provided will be executed by you. After you return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and proceed.\n\nPlease respond with either:\n- Option A plus the connection details and the SQL question; OR\n- Option B plus the server choice (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and the password if you want it set).\n\nI will not run any commands until you confirm one of the above and provide the required details.",
