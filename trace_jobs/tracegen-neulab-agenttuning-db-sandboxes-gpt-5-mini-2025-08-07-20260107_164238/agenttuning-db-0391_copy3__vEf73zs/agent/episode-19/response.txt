  "analysis": "You're in an Ubuntu 24.04 container where I have already installed the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server present or running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket), and you have not given any database question or connection credentials. Because there is neither a reachable server nor connection info, no SQL can be executed yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you choose one of two options. Please pick exactly one and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable), plus the exact question you want answered.\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server here:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I'll execute (I will not run them until you confirm). Note: containers may lack systemd so starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Per your rules, every SQL I provide will be exactly one SQL statement in a single Markdown code block and nothing else. Only the first SQL code block I provide will be executed by you.\n- If you choose Option B and want me to proceed, I will present the commands I'll run and then execute them after you confirm.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details so I can proceed.",
