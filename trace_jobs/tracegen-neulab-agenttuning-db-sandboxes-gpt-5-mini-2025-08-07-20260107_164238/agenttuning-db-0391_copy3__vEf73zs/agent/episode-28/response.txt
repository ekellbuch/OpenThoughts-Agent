  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed earlier. There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket found) and you have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is neither a reachable server nor connection info, no SQL can be executed at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear next steps. Pick exactly one and reply with the requested details. I will not run any commands until you confirm.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the SQL question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm, I will (before executing anything) run these commands (I list them so you can review; I will not execute until you confirm):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld && chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld\n  4) if data dir not initialized: mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql\n  5) start server: mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n  6) sleep 3; mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" (or set root password if requested)\n- After the server is running and reachable, provide the database and SQL question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to execute.\n\nNotes:\n- Per your rules, any SQL I provide to be executed will be exactly one statement inside a single Markdown SQL code block and preceded by 'Action: Operation'. Only the SQL in the first code block will be executed by you.\n- If you choose Option B I will show and then execute the above commands only after you explicitly confirm.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus: the connection details and the SQL question; OR\n- Option B plus: which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to set a root password (and provide it if yes).",
