  "analysis": "The environment is an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket found earlier). You have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database). Without a running server or connection details I cannot execute SQL.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one of these two paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide that, I will produce one SQL operation in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL in the first code block; return the raw mysql output and I will analyze it and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption 2 — Install & run a local server in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server' and whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access.\n- If you confirm, I will (before running anything) show the exact apt-get commands I'll execute to install and start the server (note: because systemd may be absent in this container, I may need to start the server manually). After the server is running, provide the database/question and I will produce the single SQL statement to run.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option 1 plus: the connection details and the SQL question you want executed; OR\n- Option 2 plus: which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and the root-password policy.\n\nI will wait for your choice. No commands will be run until you confirm which path and provide the required details.",
