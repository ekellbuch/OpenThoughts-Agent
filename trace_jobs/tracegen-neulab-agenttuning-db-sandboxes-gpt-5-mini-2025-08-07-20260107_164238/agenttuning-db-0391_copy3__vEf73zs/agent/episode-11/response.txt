You have not given a database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). With no server and no credentials I cannot run any SQL.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing server: Provide the database question plus connection details (host or socket path, port if nonstandard, username, password or indication of passwordless auth, and optional database name). Once you provide those I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nOption 2 — Install and run a local server here: Confirm whether you want mysql-server or mariadb-server installed and whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access. If you confirm, I will (before running anything) show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will execute to install and start the server in this container. After the server is running, tell me the database/question and I will produce the single SQL statement to run.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the necessary details (for Option 1: connection credentials and the SQL question; for Option 2: server choice and root password preference).",
