  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (root@f183150768af:/app#). The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) has already been installed in this environment. No MySQL server is running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket discovered earlier). You have not provided any database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is no reachable server and no connection info, no SQL can be executed right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear next steps so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide the exact database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze that output and then either request the next operation or provide the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also indicate whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will (before running anything) show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will execute. Note: because this container may lack systemd, starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly. After the server is up, provide the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\nImportant: Per your rules, whenever I supply SQL it will be exactly one statement inside a single Markdown code block and preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. After you run that statement and give me the raw MySQL output, I will continue.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A and provide connection details + the SQL question; OR\n- Option B and indicate server choice (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and the root-password policy.\n\nI will not run any further commands until you choose one of these options and provide the necessary details.",
