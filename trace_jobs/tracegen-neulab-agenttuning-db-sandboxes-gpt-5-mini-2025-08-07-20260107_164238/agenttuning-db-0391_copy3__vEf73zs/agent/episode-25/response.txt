  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket found earlier), and you have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). All discovery steps and client installation have been completed; no SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server or connection info.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of two paths. Please reply with exactly one of the options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown SQL code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also indicate whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will run (I will not execute them until you confirm). Note: this container may lack systemd, so starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly. After the server is running, give me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement to run.\n\nPlease respond with either Option A + connection details + the SQL question, OR Option B + server choice and root password preference. I will not run further commands until you choose one and provide the required details.",
