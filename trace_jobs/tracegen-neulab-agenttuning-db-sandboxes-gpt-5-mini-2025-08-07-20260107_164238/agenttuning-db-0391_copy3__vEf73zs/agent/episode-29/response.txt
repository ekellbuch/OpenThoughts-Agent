  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (root@f183150768af:/app#). The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, and no socket was found earlier. You have not provided a database question or connection details for a remote server (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is neither a reachable server nor credentials, no SQL can be executed right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two actions so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact database question and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable). \n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install ('mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server') and whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will run the following commands (I will not run them until you explicitly confirm):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server    # or mariadb-server if you prefer\n  3) mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld && chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld\n  4) if data dir not initialized: mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql\n  5) start server: mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n  6) sleep 3; mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"  # or set root password if you requested one\n\nWhich option do you choose? If Option A, paste the connection details and the SQL question now. If Option B, state the server to install and your root-password preference. I will not run any commands until you confirm. Note: when you give connection details and the question, I will output exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation + one-line SQL in a Markdown code block) per your requirements.",
