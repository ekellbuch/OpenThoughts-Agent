  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container. I have already installed the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket) and you have not provided any database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is neither a reachable server nor connection info, I cannot execute any SQL yet. All discovery and client-installation steps have been completed.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one clear next step so I can proceed. Pick exactly one of the options below and provide the requested details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the database question you want answered and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and the database name (if applicable).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in that first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; I will analyze it and either request the next operation or give the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me which server to install: 'mysql-server' or 'mariadb-server'. Also indicate whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to initialize insecure/passwordless local root access (insecure).\n- If you confirm installation, I will (before running anything) show the exact apt-get install and startup commands I will execute. Note: because this container may lack systemd, starting the server may require manual initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure) and running mysqld_safe or mysqld directly. After the server is up, tell me the database/question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement to run.\n\nImportant: Per your rules, whenever I supply SQL it will be exactly one SQL statement in a single Markdown code block and nothing else. Only the first SQL block I provide will be executed by you.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details (for Option A: connection credentials and the SQL question; for Option B: server choice and root-password preference). I will not run any further commands until you reply.",
