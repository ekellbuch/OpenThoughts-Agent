  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client in the container (mysql 8.0.44 is now available). Previously there was no mysql binary, no mysqld process, no MySQL socket or data directory. After apt-get update and installing default-mysql-client, the client is present. There is still no MySQL server running locally, so I cannot run SQL against a local database until a server is started here or I am given connection details for a remote server. I've verified the runtime environment is Ubuntu 24.04 and apt-get is available, so installing a server locally is possible if you want that.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the database question and the connection details (host, port, user, password, and optionally database name or socket) or tell me to install and start a local server. Once you provide the question and connection info, I will: 1) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. 2) After you return the output I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL statement (if further operations are needed) or produce the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' pattern. Notes and thoughts: - Because you require that I put SQL in a markdown block and that only the first SQL block will be executed, I will always craft a single-line SQL statement. - If you want me to operate on a local server instead of a remote one, tell me to install a server; I can install mariadb-server or mysql-server and attempt to start it, but some container setups lack init/systemd and manual startup steps may be required. - If you supply connection credentials, include whether to use TLS and whether I should target a specific database. - If your question is only conceptual or you just want the final answer without running SQL, say so and I will respond with 'Action: Answer' and the exact final answer array.",
