Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nI will ask you a question, then you should help me operate a MySQL database with SQL to answer the question.\nYou have to explain the problem and your solution to me and write down your thoughts.\nAfter thinking and explaining thoroughly, every round you can choose to operate or to answer.\nyour operation should be like this:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;\n```\nYou MUST put SQL in markdown format without any other comments. Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then write down:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\nDO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer.

Previously there was no mysql binary, no mysqld process, no MySQL socket or data directory. After apt-get update and installing default-mysql-client, the client is present. There is still no MySQL server running locally, so I cannot run SQL against a local database until a server is started here or I am given connection details for a remote server. I've verified the runtime environment is Ubuntu 24.04 and apt-get is available, so installing a server locally is possible if you want that.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"I will wait for you to provide the database question and the connection details (host, port, user, password, and optionally database name or socket) or tell me to install and start a local server. Once you provide the question and connection info, I will: 1) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. 2) After you return the output I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL statement (if further operations are needed) or produce the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' pattern. Notes and thoughts: - Because you require that I put SQL in a markdown block and that only the first SQL block will be executed, I will always craft a single-line SQL statement. - If you want me to operate on a local server instead of a remote one, tell me to install a server; I can install mariadb-server or mysql-server and attempt to start it, but some container setups lack init/systemd and manual startup steps may be required. - If you supply connection credentials, include whether to use TLS and whether I should target a specific database. - If your question is only conceptual or you just want the final answer without running SQL, say so and I will respond with 'Action: Answer' and the exact final answer array.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"annotations\": [], \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1767822374, \"model\": \"gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 1279, \"prompt_tokens\": 3906, \"total_tokens\": 5185, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 832, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}",
