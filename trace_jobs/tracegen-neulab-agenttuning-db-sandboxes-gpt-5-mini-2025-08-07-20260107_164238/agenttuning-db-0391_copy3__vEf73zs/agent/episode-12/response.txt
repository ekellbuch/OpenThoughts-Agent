  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket discovered). You have not provided a database question or any connection credentials (host/port/user/password/database). Because there is neither a local server nor connection details for a remote server, I cannot execute any SQL at this time.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear paths so I can proceed exactly as you require:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide the database question and full connection details: host (or UNIX socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or note if passwordless auth is used), and the database name (if applicable).\n- Once you provide that, I will produce one SQL operation in the exact required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a Markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first code block; return the raw mysql output to me and I will analyze it and either provide the next single SQL statement or conclude with 'Action: Answer' and the exact final answer array.\n\nOption B — Install and run a MySQL/MariaDB server locally in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server and whether to set a root password or allow passwordless local root access.\n- If you confirm, I'll run apt-get install for the chosen server and then start the server manually (note: this container likely lacks systemd so the startup may require running the server binary directly or using mysqld_safe; I will show the exact commands before executing). After the server is running, tell me the database/question and I will produce the single SQL statement to run.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Per your rules, every time I supply SQL it will be exactly one statement inside the required Markdown code block and nothing else. I will not execute SQL until you run the provided code block and return the output.\n- If you want me to proceed now with installing a local server, confirm server choice and password policy and I will present the exact apt-get and startup commands I will run.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details (for Option A: connection credentials and the SQL question; for Option B: server choice and root password preference).",
