  "analysis": "There is no MySQL client or server on this system: `mysql` command is not found, no `mysqld` processes, and common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) are absent. The container/shell is at /app. I currently have no database files or credentials and no question from you yet to answer. Before I can run SQL, I need either (A) connection details/credentials to an existing MySQL server you want me to query, or (B) a local database file or SQL dump to operate on. I will search the /app tree for any SQL/database/config files and check environment variables and available package managers so we can decide how to proceed.",
  "plan": "1) List the contents of /app to see any project files. 2) Find any SQL or DB files, config files, or environment files under /app (and nearby) that might contain schema or credentials. 3) Inspect environment variables for DB-related entries (MYSQL_, DB_, DATABASE_, etc.). 4) Check which package manager is available (apt-get, apk, yum) so we can install a mysql client if needed. Based on results, I'll ask you for credentials or proceed to install a client or run SQL against a local DB file.",
