  "analysis": "I don't yet have a database question from you. The terminal shows I'm running as root in /app, but there is no information about a MySQL server or databases. To proceed I need either (a) the specific question you want answered about a MySQL database and credentials/connection details, or (b) permission to probe the local environment to discover if a MySQL server/client is present and accessible. I'll first check whether the mysql client is available, whether a mysqld process is running, and whether typical MySQL directories/sockets exist so we can decide how to connect.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). 2) Check running processes for mysqld/mysql to see if a server is running. 3) List common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) to find sockets or data directories. 4) Check whether port 3306 is listening. Based on these results I'll ask you for credentials or attempt a local connection. Each command is short and non-blocking so I can inspect outputs before deciding the next SQL to run.",
