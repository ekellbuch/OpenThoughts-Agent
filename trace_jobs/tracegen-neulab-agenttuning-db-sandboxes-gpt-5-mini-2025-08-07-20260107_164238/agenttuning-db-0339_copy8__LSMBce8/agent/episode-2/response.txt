  "analysis": "So far there's no MySQL client or server on this container: the `mysql` command is missing, no `mysqld` processes, and no MySQL directories were found. Apt is available (/usr/bin/apt-get), and /app is empty. To run SQL I need a way to connect to a MySQL server — either a local server (not present) or a remote server (you must provide host, port, user, password, and database). At minimum I should install a MySQL client so we can connect to wherever the database is hosted.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) to get the `mysql` CLI. 3) Verify the client is installed by running `mysql --version`. After that I'll ask you for the connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or for a SQL dump/local DB to operate on. If you provide connection details I will then produce the single-line SQL statement you want me to execute (in the required markdown SQL block) and you will run it and return the output.",
