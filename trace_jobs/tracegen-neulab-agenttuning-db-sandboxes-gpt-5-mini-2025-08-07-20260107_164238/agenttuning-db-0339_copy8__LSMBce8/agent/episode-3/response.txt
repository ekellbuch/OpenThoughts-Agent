There is still no local MySQL server or database files found earlier, and no DB-related environment variables were present. I cannot run SQL until I have connection details (a running MySQL server to connect to) or a local database/dump to operate on. You also haven't yet provided the specific question you want answered against the database.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL yet. Please provide the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database name) or supply a SQL dump / sqlite file if you want operations on a local DB. Also tell me the exact question you want answered (for example: list databases, show tables in X, count rows in table Y, select rows matching condition, etc.). Once you provide connection info I will: 1) connect using the mysql client and authenticate, 2) run a single SQL statement that you and I agree on (I will format it exactly as required: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL block), and 3) interpret the returned output and either run further operations or produce the final answer. Example queries I can run after you provide credentials: - SHOW DATABASES; - USE your_db; SHOW TABLES; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table WHERE ...; - SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 10; Tell me which one you want, or give full connection details and the question.",
