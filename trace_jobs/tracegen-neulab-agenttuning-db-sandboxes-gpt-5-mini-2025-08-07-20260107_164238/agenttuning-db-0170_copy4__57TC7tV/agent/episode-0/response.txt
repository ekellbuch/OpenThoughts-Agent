  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app (bash warning about no job control). No commands have been run yet in this session. I need to locate the MySQL client/server (binaries, socket, data directory) and confirm whether a MySQL server is running and how to connect before we can run SQL statements. Once I know how to connect (socket, host/port, credentials, or presence of a local mysql client), I can execute the SQL you request in the required format. At this point nothing has been accomplished besides starting the shell; the next steps are environment discovery.",
  "plan": "I will run a short sequence of commands to (1) list files in the current directory, (2) show the current working directory, (3) check likely MySQL data and run-time locations, (4) check running processes for MySQL/MariaDB, (5) see if a mysql client is installed and its version, and (6) test for the presence of a MySQL socket. These checks will tell us whether we should connect via socket or TCP and whether the client is present. After these checks I will report findings and request the specific SQL question to run (or, if you already have a question, we can proceed to execute one SQL statement in the required format).",
