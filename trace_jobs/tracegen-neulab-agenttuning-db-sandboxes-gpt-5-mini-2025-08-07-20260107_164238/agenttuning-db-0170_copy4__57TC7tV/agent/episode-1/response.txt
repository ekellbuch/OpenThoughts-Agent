  "analysis": "From the terminal output: you are root in /app. There is no MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql does not exist), no mysqld/mySQL process is running, and there is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found). No UNIX socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. In short: there is currently no MySQL server to talk to and no client to issue SQL. To run SQL statements against a MySQL server we need either (a) an existing reachable MySQL server (host/port/credentials), or (b) install and run a MySQL/MariaDB server here, or at minimum install a mysql client to connect remotely. Nothing has been executed to modify the environment yet.",
  "plan": "I will install a MySQL-compatible client so we can run SQL commands once a server is available. Steps: (1) update apt package index; (2) install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so the `mysql` command becomes available; (3) verify the client is installed by running `which mysql` and `mysql --version`. After that, if you provide the database host/port/user/password or indicate we should start a local server, I will proceed with a single SQL statement in the required format. If installing the client fails (no network or apt), I will report that and we will choose another approach.",
