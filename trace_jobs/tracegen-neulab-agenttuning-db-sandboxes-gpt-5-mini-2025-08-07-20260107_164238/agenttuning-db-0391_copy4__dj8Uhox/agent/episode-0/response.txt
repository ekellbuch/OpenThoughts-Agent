  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app (prompt: root@45ea8e073055:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session. There is no question from you about the database yet, and I have not executed any SQL. I cannot see any MySQL client or server status from the prompt alone. To proceed I need the specific question you want answered about the MySQL database (for example: list rows matching a condition, aggregate, modify data, schema question, etc.), and (if necessary) any connection details or credentials if you want me to attempt to connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "1) Ask you to provide the database question you want answered. 2) Once you provide the question, I will:    - Reason about the data and design the exact single-line SQL statement needed.    - Present the SQL in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a markdown code block, one line only).    - You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me.    - I will analyze the output and either produce another Operation (one SQL statement) or, when finished, produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array. 3) If you want me to run commands from this shell to connect to MySQL first, provide connection details or confirm I should try default local root connection. I will then give the exact mysql client command to run. Expected commands I might ask you to run from the shell (I will not run anything until you instruct me to proceed):    - mysql -u<user> -p -h<host> <database> to open a client (you will enter password if prompted) OR    - mysql -u root -p if local and database unspecified. Note: I will only provide one SQL statement per Operation and it must be in a single-line code block as you requested.",
