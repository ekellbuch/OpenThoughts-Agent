You have not yet provided the specific question about the MySQL database nor any connection details or credentials. I cannot see any MySQL client or server status from the prompt alone.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me the exact database question you want answered. Once you provide the question (for example: 'Find all users with email like %@example.com', or 'Count orders per customer in 2025'), I will: 1) Formulate the single-line SQL statement needed to answer that question. 2) Present it exactly in the required format: first the text 'Action: Operation', then a single SQL statement in a one-line markdown code block (no other comments). You must execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me. 3) I will analyze the output and either provide the next single SQL statement or, when finished, provide 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array. If you want me to first connect from this shell to the database, provide credentials (host, port, user, database, and whether a password should be used) or run the mysql client yourself. Example mysql client command you can run from this shell if the DB is local and you want to connect as root (replace details as needed):\nmysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 DATABASE_NAME\n(enter the password when prompted).",
