  "analysis": "Container: Ubuntu 24.04, running as root in /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully. There is no local MySQL server process (no mysqld), no database files or schemas found under /app, and no MySQL credentials or connection information have been provided. You have not supplied a SQL question or target tables/schema. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to be answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns and state whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output (using mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\").\n\nWhen you reply, include either (A) the question + schema/table names, or (B) the connection credentials + question. After that I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the output (Option B).",
