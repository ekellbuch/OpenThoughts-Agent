  "analysis": "I have prepared the environment: Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no database files, schemas, or credentials available in /app. You have not provided a SQL question, target table/schema, nor connection credentials. Because of that I cannot run any SQL or produce query results yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question to be answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns. Indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here. Also provide the exact question.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (include question + schema) or Option B (include credentials + question). Once you do, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the output (Option B).",
