No local MySQL server (mysqld) was found and there are no database files, schemas, or credentials in /app. You have not provided a SQL question, target table/schema, nor any MySQL connection credentials. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide the required details.\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns and whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\" for you to run. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nWhen you reply, include either (A) the question + schema or (B) the credentials + question. After that I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and then (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the output (Option B).",
