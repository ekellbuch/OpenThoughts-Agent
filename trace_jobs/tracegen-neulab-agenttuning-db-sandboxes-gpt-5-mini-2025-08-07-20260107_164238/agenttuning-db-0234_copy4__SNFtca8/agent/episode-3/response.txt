There is still no local MySQL server detected earlier, and you have not yet provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, user, password, database name). I cannot run any SQL against a database until I have the question and either (a) you run the SQL I provide in the required format and return the raw MySQL output, or (b) you supply connection credentials and permit me to connect from this container using the mysql client.",
  "plan": "I will not run any shell commands now. To proceed, please choose one of the following and provide the requested information:\n\n1) You will execute SQL yourself: Tell me the question you want answered and provide any relevant context (which database and table(s) to query). I will (a) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run, and then (b) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\n2) I should connect from this container: Provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If you want me to run the query from here I will craft the mysql client command and execute it. Note that providing credentials here is required for me to connect.\n\nIf you choose option 1, tell me the question and the target database/table. If you choose option 2, provide the connection info and the question. Once you provide that, I will explain my plan, then produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you specified.",
