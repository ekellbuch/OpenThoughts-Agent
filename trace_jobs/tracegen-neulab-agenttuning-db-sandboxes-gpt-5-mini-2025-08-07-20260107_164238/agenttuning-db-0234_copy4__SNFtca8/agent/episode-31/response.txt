Please choose one of the two options and supply the requested details:\n\nOption A — You will execute a single SQL statement I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or a list of columns and indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nWhen you reply, include either (A) the question + schema/table names or (B) the connection credentials + question. After that I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and then (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the output (Option B).",
