There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas found under /app, and no connection credentials or SQL question have been provided. No SQL has been executed. I cannot query any database or produce results until you either (A) provide the exact question plus target table/schema so I can output one SQL statement for you to run, or (B) provide MySQL connection credentials so I can run queries from this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Pick one option and supply the required details:\n\nOption A — You will execute the SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns and state whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will then: explain my reasoning and produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the exact question, and confirm it is safe to use the credentials here.\n- I will then: explain my reasoning and run the SQL here using the mysql client, returning the raw output.\n\nExamples to copy:\n- Option A example: \"Question: Return top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score).\" Include schema if available.\n- Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer.\"",
