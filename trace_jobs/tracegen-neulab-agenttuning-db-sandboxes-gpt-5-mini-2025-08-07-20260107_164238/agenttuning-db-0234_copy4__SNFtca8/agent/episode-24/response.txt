  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and there are no database files, schemas, or credentials present in /app. No SQL question, target table/schema, or connection credentials have been provided by you, so I have not executed any SQL and cannot query any database or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information so I can operate on the database or produce the SQL for you to run.\n\nOption A — You will execute a single SQL statement I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to be answered and the target database and table name(s). If available, include the table schema or list of columns (DESCRIBE table or CREATE TABLE output) and whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I will do: explain my reasoning, then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format. I will prefix it with the line \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL statement (one line only) in a markdown SQL code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n- Example request you can send: \"Option A: Question: Return top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score). Read-only. Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT.\"\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container using the mysql client:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- What I will do: explain my reasoning, then run the query here with the mysql client and return the raw output. I will use a command like: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\" (I will not run anything until you provide credentials and confirm).\n- Example request you can send: \"Option B: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer (read-only).\"\n\nNotes and constraints (must-read):\n- Whenever I produce SQL for you to execute (Option A), I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block and nothing else SQL-wise. You will execute only the first SQL code block I give and return raw MySQL output.\n- If you want exploratory commands (e.g., SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE table) provide Option B credentials so I can run them here, or provide schema info in Option A so I can craft the correct SELECT.\n- When you are ready to finish and provide final answers, I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...] exactly as instructed, if and only if I am sure of the answer.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus the question and schema/table names (so I can create one SQL statement for you to run), or\n- Option B plus the connection credentials and question (so I can connect and run queries here).",
