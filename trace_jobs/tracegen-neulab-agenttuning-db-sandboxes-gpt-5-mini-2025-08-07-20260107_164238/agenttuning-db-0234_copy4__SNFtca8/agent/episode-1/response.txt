  "analysis": "The environment is a minimal container at /app running as root. There are no files in /app aside from . and .., no mysqld process is running on the host, and there is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found). No MySQL configuration (~/.my.cnf) or configuration directories (/etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld) were found. I cannot yet run any SQL against a MySQL server from this host because the client is missing and no local server is present. I also don't have a question from you yet or any database connection credentials/host to connect to a remote MySQL instance.",
  "plan": "I will (1) detect the OS, (2) detect which package manager is available, (3) attempt to install a MySQL/MariaDB client using the available package manager so we can connect to MySQL servers, and (4) verify the client installation. After the client is installed I'll ask you for the database connection details (host, port, user, password, and the SQL question you want answered). If installation fails because network is unavailable, I'll report that and we can decide on the next step (e.g., you provide a SQL output dump or connection info).",
