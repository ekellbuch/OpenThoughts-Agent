  "analysis": "The container is prepared: Ubuntu 24.04 with the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) installed. There is no local mysqld process and no database files discovered in /app. You have not yet provided any SQL question, target database/table/schema, or any connection credentials. Without either (A) the exact question plus target table(s)/schema so I can produce a single SQL statement for you to run, or (B) database connection details so I can run queries from this container, I cannot operate on a MySQL database or produce a final answer.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information. Specify which option you want and include the requested details:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL yourself\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the database/table names (and optionally table schemas or example rows).\n- I will: explain the reasoning and output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the exact question.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then execute the query here with the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nNotes and examples to help you provide info:\n- If you choose Option A, include table name(s) and columns or paste the schema (SHOW CREATE TABLE output or DESCRIBE table). Example request: \"Find the top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns id,name,score)\".\n- If you choose Option B, provide credentials in this form: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb and confirm it's okay to use them here.\n- If you want sample SQL I will produce it exactly as required: I will respond with the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line markdown code block and nothing else SQL-wise.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the question and any required details. I will then explain the planned SQL and produce the one statement (Option A) or run it (Option B).",
