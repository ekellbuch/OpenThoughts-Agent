  "analysis": "The container is ready and has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and I have not been given any database connection details, database schema, table names, or the SQL question you want answered. No further filesystem changes or SQL have been performed since the client installation. I cannot run or produce a SQL operation until you provide either (A) the question plus target database/table/schema so I can give you one SQL statement for you to execute, or (B) connection credentials so I can connect from this container and run the SQL myself.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You will run the SQL: Provide the exact question to answer and the target database and table names (and optionally table schemas or sample rows). I will (1) explain the reasoning and the SQL I plan to run, and then (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block, preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run the SQL from this container: Provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the question. I will (1) explain the reasoning and which SQL I will run, then (2) run the command here using the mysql client and report the raw output. If you provide credentials, confirm it is safe to use them here.\n\nNotes:\n- Every response where I produce SQL will include exactly one SQL statement in a single code block as you required. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide.\n- If your question requires modifying data, state that explicitly; otherwise I will assume read-only queries.\n\nTell me (A) the question and target tables/schema so I can provide a single SQL statement for you to run, or (B) the connection credentials plus the question and confirm I should execute the query from this container.",
