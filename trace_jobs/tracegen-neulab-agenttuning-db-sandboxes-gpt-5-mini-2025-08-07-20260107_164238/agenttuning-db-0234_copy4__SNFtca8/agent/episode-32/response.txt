  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (root@/app) with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process found), no database files or schemas present in /app, and no connection credentials or question have been provided. Because of that, I have not executed any SQL and cannot produce query results yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed and supply the required information. Pick one of the two options below and reply with the requested details:\n\nOption A — You will run the SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question to be answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or a list of columns and indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I'll do next: I will explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- What I'll do next: I will explain the reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nIf you choose Option A, please also paste table schema or sample rows if available so I can craft a correct SELECT. If you choose Option B, provide credentials exactly and confirm permission to use them here. After you reply with one of these options and the necessary details, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and then (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the output (Option B).",
