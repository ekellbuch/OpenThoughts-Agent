  "analysis": "Current environment: Ubuntu 24.04 container, running as root in /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed earlier. There is no local MySQL server (no mysqld process) and no database files, schemas, or credentials were found in /app. You have not provided a SQL question, table/schema, or any MySQL connection credentials. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot produce query results.",
  "plan": "I will not run any shell commands until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the two options and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or a list of columns and state whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning and then run the SQL from this container using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nNotes and examples to help you provide info:\n- Option A example: \"Question: Return the top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns id,name,score). Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Read-only.\"\n- Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer (read-only).\"\n\nAfter you supply either the question + schema (Option A) or credentials + question (Option B), I will explain the exact SQL I will run and then either (A) produce the single SQL statement for you to execute or (B) execute it here and return the raw MySQL output.",
