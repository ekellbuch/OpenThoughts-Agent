  "plan": "I will not run any SQL yet. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself: 1) Tell me the exact question you want answered and the target database and table names (or paste the relevant table schema). 2) I will explain my reasoning and then provide exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block) prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\" as you required. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I should run SQL from this container: Provide the connection details (host, port, user, password, and database name) and the question. I will explain the plan and then run the mysql client here to execute the SQL you approve.\n\nWhen you want me to produce the SQL for you to run (Option A), I will respond in this exact pattern before you execute:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n(Only one SQL statement, one-line, inside the code block. I will explain the query beforehand.)\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and include either the question and schema (Option A) or the connection credentials and question (Option B). Also confirm whether any access restrictions apply (read-only, masking, etc.).",
