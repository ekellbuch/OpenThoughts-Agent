  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server process on this host and no database files, schemas, or credentials were found in /app. You have not provided any SQL question, target table/schema, or connection credentials. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed and supply required details. Two options:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL I provide: Reply with the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns. I will (1) explain the reasoning and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container: Reply with connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it's safe to use them here, plus the exact question. I will (1) explain the reasoning and (2) run the query here using the mysql client and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you choose Option A, provide table names and schema (or sample rows). If you choose Option B, provide credentials and confirm permission. After you reply I will explain the exact SQL I will run and then either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here (Option B).",
