  "analysis": "I inspected the container and found no local mysqld server and no mysql client initially. I then detected the OS (Ubuntu 24.04) and used apt-get to install the default-mysql-client. The mysql client is now installed (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is still no MySQL server process discovered earlier, and I have no connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or the SQL question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and the database connection details. Tell me the SQL question you want answered and provide connection info (host, port, user, password, and database name if applicable). When you want me to operate I will: (1) explain the problem and the SQL I'll run, (2) provide a single SQL statement in a markdown code block (one line only) as required, and (3) you will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output. If you prefer, I can also attempt to connect from this container to a MySQL server you specify using the mysql client (example command I will run: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\") — but I will only run that after you confirm and provide credentials. Reply with the database connection details and the question, or with the next action you'd like me to take.",
