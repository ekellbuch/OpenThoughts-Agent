  "analysis": "The container is prepared: Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) installed. There is no local MySQL server running, no database files in /app, and you have not provided any database question, table/schema, or connection credentials. Because of that I cannot construct or run any SQL yet. No previous SQL operations have been executed in this session.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested information.\n\nOption A — You will execute a SQL statement I provide\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE table or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns. Indicate whether the query should be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning, then produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\" as you required. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm that it is safe to use them here. Also provide the exact question.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning, then execute the SQL from this container using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nHelpful notes and examples to include when you reply:\n- If Option A, include table name(s) and columns or paste the schema. Example: \"Database=appdb, Table=users, Columns: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Question: Return top 3 users by score.\" This allows me to craft a single precise SELECT.\n- If Option B, provide credentials exactly like: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb and state the question (e.g., \"Count orders per customer\"). I will then run the query here.\n- I will always output SQL for you to run in the exact required format when operating: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. I will not include multiple SQL statements or extra SQL code blocks.\n\nOnce you provide either the question + schema (Option A) or the connection credentials + question (Option B), I will explain the SQL I will run and then produce the single SQL statement (Option A) or execute it here (Option B).",
