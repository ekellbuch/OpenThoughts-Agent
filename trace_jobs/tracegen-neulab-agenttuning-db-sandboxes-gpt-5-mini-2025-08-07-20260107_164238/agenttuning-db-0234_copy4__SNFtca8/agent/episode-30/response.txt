  "analysis": "The container is ready (Ubuntu 24.04) and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas under /app, and you have not provided any SQL question, table/schema, or connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot perform any database operations or produce query results until you provide either (A) the question plus target table/schema so I can give you one SQL statement for you to run, or (B) MySQL connection credentials so I can run queries from this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You will execute the SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to be answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns and indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output (using mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\").\n\nExamples you can copy:\n- Option A example: \"Question: Return the top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score). Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Read-only.\" \n- Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer (read-only).\"\n\nImportant: If you choose Option A, include table names and schema or sample rows so I can craft the correct SELECT. If you choose Option B, provide credentials exactly and confirm permission to use them here. After you provide one of these, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and then (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the raw MySQL output (Option B).",
