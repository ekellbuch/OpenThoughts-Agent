There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas found under /app, and you have not supplied any SQL question, table/schema, or database connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session, so I cannot produce query results yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information.\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or the list of columns and indicate if the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (include question + schema) or Option B (include credentials + question). After that I will explain the exact SQL I will run and proceed according to your chosen option.",
