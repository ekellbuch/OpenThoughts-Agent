  "analysis": "The container is ready: Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas found in /app, and you have not provided any database question, table/schema, or connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot run or craft a meaningful SQL statement until you provide either (A) the question plus target database/table/schema so I can produce one SQL statement for you to run, or (B) MySQL connection credentials so I can connect from this container and run queries directly.",
  "plan": "Tell me how you'd like to proceed by choosing one of these options and supplying the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns, and indicate if the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question.\n- I will: explain the reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nWhen you reply, include either (A) the question + schema, or (B) the credentials + question. After that I will explain the SQL I plan to run and proceed according to your chosen option.",
