  "analysis": "The container is ready and has the mysql client installed, but you have not provided a database question or any connection details. Without either (a) the SQL question plus target database/table/schema so I can produce a single SQL statement for you to run, or (b) connection credentials so I can run SQL from this container, I cannot proceed to operate on a MySQL instance or produce a final answer.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You will run the SQL: Provide the exact question you want answered and the database/table names (and optionally table schemas). I will explain my reasoning and then produce exactly one SQL statement (one-line) inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run the SQL from this container: Provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database name) and the question. I will explain the query I will run, then execute it here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nPlease also tell me whether the database access is read-only or whether I may modify data. If you choose Option A, supply any relevant schema or sample rows if available. If you choose Option B, provide credentials and confirm it's safe to use them here.",
