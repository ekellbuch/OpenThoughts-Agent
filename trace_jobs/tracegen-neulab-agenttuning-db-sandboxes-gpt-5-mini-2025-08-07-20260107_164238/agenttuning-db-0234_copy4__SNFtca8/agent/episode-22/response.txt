  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully. There is no local MySQL server (no mysqld process), no database files or schemas found under /app, and no connection credentials or a SQL question have been provided. No SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot run or craft a meaningful SQL query until you either (A) give the SQL question plus target table/schema so I can produce one SQL statement for you to run, or (B) supply MySQL connection credentials so I can connect from this container and run queries.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the two options you want and provide the required details. I will then explain the SQL I will run and proceed accordingly.\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If available, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or a list of columns and indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I'll do: explain my reasoning and output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- What I'll do: explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here with the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nHelpful examples you can copy:\n- Option A example: \"Question: Return top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score). Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Read-only.\"\n- Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer.\"\n\nImportant: If you choose Option A, I will only provide one SQL statement in the exact format you required and nothing else SQL-wise. If you choose Option B, I will run queries here using the mysql client already installed.",
