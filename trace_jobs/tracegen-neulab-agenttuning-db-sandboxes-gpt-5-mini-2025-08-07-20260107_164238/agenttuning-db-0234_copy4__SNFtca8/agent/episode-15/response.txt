  "analysis": "The container is ready (Ubuntu 24.04) and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas found in /app, and you have not supplied any SQL question, table/schema, or connection credentials. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot produce query results yet.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or column names. Indicate if the query must be read-only.\n- What I will do: explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question.\n- What I will do: explain the reasoning, then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nNotes:\n- When I provide SQL for you to run (Option A), I will include exactly one SQL statement in a single code block. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide. No multiple statements.\n- If you choose Option B, I will use the mysql client already installed (mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\") unless you instruct otherwise.\n\nReply with either Option A (include question and schema) or Option B (include credentials and question). After you do, I will explain the planned SQL and then produce the single SQL statement (Option A) or execute it here (Option B).",
