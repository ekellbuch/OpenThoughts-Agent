  "analysis": "The container is ready: Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). No local MySQL server is running, there are no database files or schemas in /app, and you have not provided any SQL question, target table/schema, or database connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session, so I cannot produce any query results yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Provide one of the two options below along with the required details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — You will execute a single SQL statement I provide\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or the list of columns, and indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use the credentials here, plus the exact question.\n- I will: explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nExamples you can copy:\n- Option A example: \"Question: Return top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score). Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Read-only.\"\n- Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer.\"\n\nWhen you provide either the question + schema (Option A) or connection credentials + question (Option B), I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and then (2) either output the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the raw MySQL output (Option B).",
