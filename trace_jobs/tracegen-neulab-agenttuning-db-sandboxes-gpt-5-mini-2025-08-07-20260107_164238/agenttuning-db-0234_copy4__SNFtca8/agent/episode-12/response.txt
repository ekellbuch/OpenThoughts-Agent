  "analysis": "You have an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local mysqld running and no database files, schemas, or credentials present in /app. You have not provided a SQL question, target table/schema, or any connection credentials. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two ways to proceed and supply the required information.\n\nOption A — You will run the SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If available, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns. Indicate if the query must be read-only.\n- What I will do: explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run the SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question.\n- What I will do: explain the reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and provide the requested details (question + schema for Option A, or credentials + question for Option B). After that I will explain the exact SQL I will run and proceed according to the option you selected.",
