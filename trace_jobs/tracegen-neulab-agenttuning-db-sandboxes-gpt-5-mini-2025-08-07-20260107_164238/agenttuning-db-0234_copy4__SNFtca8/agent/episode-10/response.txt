  "analysis": "The container is running Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed successfully. There is no local mysqld process and no database files, schemas, or credentials found in /app. You have not provided a SQL question, target database/table/schema, or any connection credentials. As a result I cannot run any SQL or produce an answer yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Provide one of the two options below and the required details:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE table or CREATE TABLE) or column names.\n- What I will do: explain my reasoning, then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm that it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question.\n- What I will do: explain my reasoning, then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nNotes and guidance:\n- Every time I produce SQL for you to execute, it will be exactly one SQL statement in one code block as you required. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide.\n- If your query is read-only, say so. If it requires modifying data, state that explicitly.\n- Example request formats you can copy:\n  * Option A example: \"Find the top 3 users by score in database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns id,name,score).\" Include schema if available.\n  * Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — return count of orders per customer.\"\n\nReply with either Option A (question + table/schema) or Option B (credentials + question). Once you reply I will explain the SQL I will run and then produce the single SQL statement (Option A) or run it here (Option B).",
