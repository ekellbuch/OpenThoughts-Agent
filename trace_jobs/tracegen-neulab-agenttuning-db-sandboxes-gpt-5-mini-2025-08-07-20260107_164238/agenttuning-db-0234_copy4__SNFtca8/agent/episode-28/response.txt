  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas found under /app, and no connection credentials or SQL question have been provided. No SQL has been executed in this session and I cannot query any database or produce results until you provide either: (A) the SQL question plus target table/schema so I can give you one SQL statement to run, or (B) MySQL connection credentials so I can run queries from this container.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the two options you choose and supply the required details so I can proceed. I will then explain the SQL I will run and follow your requested execution flow.\n\nOption A — You will run the SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns and whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I will do: explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output for me to continue.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- What I will do: explain my reasoning, then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output. Example I would run: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\"\n\nNotes and examples\n- If Option A, helpful example input: \"Question: Return the top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score). Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Read-only.\"\n- If Option B, helpful example input: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer (read-only).\"\n- When I produce an operation for you to run, it will follow exactly this pattern and contain only one SQL statement in the SQL code block:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n- When I am ready to provide a final answer (after sufficient query results), I will output:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus your question and table/schema, or\n- Option B plus connection credentials and your question.\n",
