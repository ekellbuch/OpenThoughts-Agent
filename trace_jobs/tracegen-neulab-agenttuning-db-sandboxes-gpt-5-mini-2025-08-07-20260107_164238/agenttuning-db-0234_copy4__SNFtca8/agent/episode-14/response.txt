  "analysis": "The container is ready: Ubuntu 24.04 with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas in /app, and I have not been given any SQL question, table/schema, or connection credentials. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information. Explain which option you want and include the details listed below.\n\nOption A — You will execute the SQL I provide\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If available, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or the list of columns and whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning, then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here. Also provide the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning, then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nNotes and examples to help you provide info:\n- If Option A, include table name(s) and columns or paste the schema. Example: \"Database=appdb, Table=users, Columns: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Question: Return top 3 users by score (read-only).\"\n- If Option B, provide credentials exactly like: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb and the question (e.g., \"Count orders per customer\").\n- When producing SQL for you to run, I will obey your format requirement: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by exactly one SQL statement as a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block. I will include no other SQL code blocks.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (question + schema) or Option B (connection credentials + question). Once you do, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run, and then (2) either produce the single SQL statement for you to execute (Option A) or execute it here and return the raw output (Option B).",
