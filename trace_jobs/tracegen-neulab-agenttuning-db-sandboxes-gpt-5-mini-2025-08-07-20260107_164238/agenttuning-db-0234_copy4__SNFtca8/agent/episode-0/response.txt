  "analysis": "The shell shows a root prompt in /app but no recent commands or MySQL interaction. No SQL question from you has been given yet. Before I can run any SQL against a MySQL server I need to: (1) discover whether a MySQL server is running on this host or accessible, (2) find a MySQL client and any credentials (e.g. /root/.my.cnf, environment variables, or config files), and (3) locate any database files or .sql dumps in the filesystem. Nothing so far has been accomplished toward those goals.",
  "plan": "I'll inspect the environment and the filesystem to detect a running MySQL server and any credentials or SQL files. Specifically I will: (a) confirm current directory and user, (b) list files in /app, (c) check running processes for mysqld, (d) check mysql client availability and version, (e) search environment for MySQL-related variables, (f) check for a root MySQL client config (~/.my.cnf), (g) list common MySQL directories (/etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld), (h) search for .sql files and any .my.cnf files and search /app for strings like \"password\" to find credentials. These steps will give me what I need to attempt a MySQL connection and then run the single SQL statement you ask for. I will run the following commands in order; each command is chosen to be quick to run and to return information I need.",
