  "analysis": "The container is an Ubuntu 24.04 environment with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas in /app, and no MySQL credentials or connection information have been provided. You have not given a database question or a target table/schema to query. Because of that, no SQL operations have been executed and I cannot produce query results.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you choose one of the two options and provide the required information. Please pick one of the following and supply the details:\n\nOption A — You will execute a single SQL statement I provide\n- Provide: the exact question you want answered and the target database and table name(s). If possible, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or the list of columns. Indicate whether the query should be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here. Also provide the exact question.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nExamples to copy when replying:\n- Option A example: \"Question: Return the top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns: id,name,score). Schema: id INT, name VARCHAR, score INT. Read-only.\" \n- Option B example: \"host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb — Question: Count orders per customer.\" \n\nOnce you provide either (A) the question + schema or (B) connection credentials + question, I will (1) explain the SQL I'll run and (2) produce the single SQL statement (Option A) or run it here and return the output (Option B).",
