  "analysis": "The environment is an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no database files or credentials found in /app. You have not provided a database question, target table/schema, or connection credentials. Because of that, I cannot construct or run any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will run a provided SQL statement:\n- Provide the exact question you want answered and the target database/table names (and optionally table schemas or sample rows).\n- I will explain the reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the exact question.\n- I will explain the reasoning, then execute the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nIf you choose Option A, include any relevant schema or column names. If you choose Option B, include credentials in the form host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here. After you supply one of these, I will produce the single SQL statement (or run it) following your chosen option.",
