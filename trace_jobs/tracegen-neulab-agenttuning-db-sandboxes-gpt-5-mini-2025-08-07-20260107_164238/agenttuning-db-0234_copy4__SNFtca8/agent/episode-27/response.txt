  "analysis": "The container is ready (Ubuntu 24.04) and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or schemas found in /app, and you have not provided any SQL question, table/schema, or connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot query any database or produce results until you either (A) provide the exact question plus target table/schema so I can output a single SQL statement for you to run, or (B) provide MySQL connection credentials so I can connect from this container and run queries directly.",
  "plan": "Tell me which option you choose and supply the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will execute the SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If available, include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or list of columns and whether the query must be read-only.\n- I will then: explain the reasoning and output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here, plus the exact question and whether queries should be read-only.\n- I will then: explain the reasoning and run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nIf you choose Option A, please also paste table schema or sample rows if possible so I can craft a correct SELECT. If you choose Option B, provide credentials exactly (host, port, user, password, database) and confirm permission to use them here. After you reply I will explain the SQL I will run and proceed as requested.",
