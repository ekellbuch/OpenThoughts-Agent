  "analysis": "The container is ready and prepared: Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process), no database files or schemas in /app, and you have not provided any SQL question, table/schema, or connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot query any database or produce results until you either (A) provide the exact question plus target database/table/schema so I can produce one SQL statement for you to run, or (B) provide MySQL connection credentials so I can connect from this container and run queries directly.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and supply the required details:\n\nOption A — You will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide: the exact question to answer and the target database and table name(s). If possible include the table schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE) or a list of columns, and indicate whether the query must be read-only.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL) inside a markdown code block prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide: connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use the credentials here, plus the exact question.\n- What I'll do: I will explain my reasoning and then run the SQL here using the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\nWhen you reply, include either (A) the question + schema (for Option A) or (B) the credentials + question (for Option B). After that I will explain the exact SQL I will run and proceed according to your chosen option.",
