  "analysis": "Container is ready (Ubuntu 24.04) and the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully. There is no local MySQL server running, no database files discovered in /app, and no connection credentials or SQL question have been provided by you. So far I have prepared the environment to run MySQL client commands, but no SQL has been executed because you haven't given the question or database access details.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you choose how to proceed. You must pick one of two options:\n\nOption A — You (the user) will execute SQL I provide:\n- Provide the exact question you want answered and the target database and table names (or the schema). Optionally include sample rows or constraints.\n- I will explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Provide connection details in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... and confirm it is safe to use them here.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered. I will explain the reasoning, then run the appropriate SQL using the mysql client from this container and return the raw output.\n\nNotes and guidance to help you provide what I need:\n- If you choose Option A, include table name(s) and columns or paste the schema (DESCRIBE or CREATE TABLE output). Example question: \"Return the top 3 users by score from database 'appdb' table 'users' (columns id,name,score)\".\n- If you choose Option B, provide credentials like: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret database=appdb. I will then execute queries here and show output.\n- Every time I produce SQL for you to run, I will include exactly one SQL statement in the single code block as you required. You must execute only that SQL and return its raw MySQL output for me to continue.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide either the question + schema (Option A) or the connection credentials + question (Option B). After that I'll explain the planned SQL and either produce the single SQL statement (Option A) or execute it here (Option B).",
