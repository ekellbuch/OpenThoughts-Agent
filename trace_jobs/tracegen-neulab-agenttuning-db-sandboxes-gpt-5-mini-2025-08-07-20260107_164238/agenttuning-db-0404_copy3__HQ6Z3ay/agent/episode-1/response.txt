There is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no MySQL server socket at /var/run/mysqld, no running MySQL processes, and no MySQL-related environment variables. Nothing has been done yet to connect to or query a database. To run SQL I need a MySQL client (or another SQL client) and a reachable MySQL server (local or remote).",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client so I can issue SQL commands from this shell. Steps:\n1) Run apt-get update to refresh package lists (so install can succeed).\n2) Install the default MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so the mysql CLI is available.\n3) Verify the mysql client is installed by checking mysql --version.\n4) Re-check for any running MySQL server processes or sockets (ps and /var/run/mysqld) so we know whether we can connect locally. If no server is present, we'll request connection details (host, port, user, password) to connect remotely or you can start a server.\n\nI expect apt-get update and apt-get install to download and install the client. After that mysql --version should report the client version. If no server is running, connection attempts will fail until a server is available or remote credentials are provided.",
