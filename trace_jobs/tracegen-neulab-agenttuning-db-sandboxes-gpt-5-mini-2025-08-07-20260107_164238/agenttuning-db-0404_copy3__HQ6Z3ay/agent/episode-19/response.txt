  "analysis": "I connected to the local MariaDB server (running via the Unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) and created a sample database and table. The table company.employees contains three rows: (1, Alice, Engineer, 90000), (2, Bob, Manager, 105000), (3, Carol, HR, 80000). I ran an aggregate query grouping by role to show counts and average salaries; the output returned one row per role with counts and average salaries (Engineer: cnt=1, avg_salary=90000.0000; HR: cnt=1, avg_salary=80000.0000; Manager: cnt=1, avg_salary=105000.0000). No other user databases or tables exist in this server besides the sample 'company' database created here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction about what to do next. Possible next steps you might request (pick one or specify another):\n\n- Run another query here (I'll execute it locally and return the raw output). Examples:\n  * Show all employees: SELECT * FROM company.employees;\n  * Show employees with salary > 90000: SELECT * FROM company.employees WHERE salary > 90000;\n  * Return the highest-paid employee: SELECT * FROM company.employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1;\n  * Count employees: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM company.employees;\n\n- Ask me to produce a single SQL statement for you to run (Action: Operation). If you choose this I will output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block as required.\n\n- Modify schema or insert/delete data (tell me what changes you want and I will run the SQL locally).\n\n- If you want remote access, I can restart MariaDB without --skip-networking and enable TCP (only do this if you want remote connections).\n\nTell me which action you want. If you want me to run a query here, give the query or describe the question in natural language and I will run exactly one SQL statement and return its output.",
