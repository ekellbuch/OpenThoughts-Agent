  "plan": "I will not change the system yet. Please choose one of the options below so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server: provide connection details (host or socket path, port, username, password, and database name if relevant) and tell me the exact question you want answered. I will then produce a single SQL statement (in the required one-line markdown code block format) for you to execute; you will run it and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: confirm you want me to proceed and specify any desired root password or user/database to create (or accept defaults). If you confirm, I will run installation and startup commands, create a database/user if requested, and then run queries as needed.\n\nOption C — Provide a database dump or sample data file to load here and specify the query you want answered.\n\nTell me which option you want and provide the requested details. I will then either (1) produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to run, or (2) execute commands here to install/start a local server and then run SQL as requested.",
