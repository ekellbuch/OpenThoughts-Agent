  "analysis": "I created a local MariaDB server, connected via the Unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock as root, and created a sample database and table. Current state: database 'company' exists with one table 'employees'. The table 'company.employees' contains three rows:\n- id=1, name=Alice, role=Engineer, salary=90000\n- id=2, name=Bob, role=Manager, salary=105000\n- id=3, name=Carol, role=HR, salary=80000\nNo further user databases or data exist beyond this sample. The root@localhost account has ALL PRIVILEGES and authenticates via unix_socket, so I can run any SQL locally using the socket.",
  "plan": "Next, you can choose one of the following actions and I will proceed exactly as you request:\n\nOption A — I run a SQL query here and return the results: tell me the SQL or the question (examples: \"list all employees\", \"show employees with salary > 90000\", \"count employees by role\"). I will execute the query locally using the mysql client with the socket and return the raw output.\n\nOption B — I produce a single SQL statement for you to execute (Action: Operation): if you want that, specify the question/goal and the target database/table; I will reply with exactly one SQL statement in the required one-line markdown code block format and you will run it and return the output.\n\nOption C — Create/modify schema or insert more data: specify schema changes or data to insert and I will run the necessary SQL commands locally and show results.\n\nIf you choose Option A or C, I will run mysql -u root -S /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" locally. If you choose Option B, I will output the single SQL statement in the Action: Operation format for you to run yourself.\n\nTell me which option you choose and the exact query or change you want. Example quick requests you can copy:\n- \"Show all employees.\" (I will run SELECT * FROM company.employees;)\n- \"Show employees with salary > 90000.\" (I will run SELECT * FROM company.employees WHERE salary > 90000;)\n- \"Return names of employees ordered by salary desc.\" (I will run SELECT name FROM company.employees ORDER BY salary DESC;)\n\nI will not run anything until you confirm which action you want.",
