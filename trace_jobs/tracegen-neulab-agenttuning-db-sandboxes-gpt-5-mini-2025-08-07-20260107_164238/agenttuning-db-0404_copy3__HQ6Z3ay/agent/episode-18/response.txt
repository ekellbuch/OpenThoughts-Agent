A sample database 'company' with table 'employees' exists and contains three rows: Alice (Engineer, 90000), Bob (Manager, 105000), and Carol (HR, 80000). No further queries have been run since the sample data was inserted. To provide a useful summary of the employee data, an aggregate query (count and average salary per role) will show role distribution and average compensation.",

I will connect as root using the Unix socket and execute: SELECT role, COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM company.employees GROUP BY role; I expect one row per role with the count and average salary.
