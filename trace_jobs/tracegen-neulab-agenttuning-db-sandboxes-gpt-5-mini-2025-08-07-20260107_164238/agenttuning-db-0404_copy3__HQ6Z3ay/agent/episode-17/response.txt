  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running locally and I connected via the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock as root. I created a sample database 'company' and a table 'company.employees' with three rows: (1, Alice, Engineer, 90000), (2, Bob, Manager, 105000), (3, Carol, HR, 80000). The server was started with --skip-networking, so it only accepts local socket connections. The root@localhost account has ALL PRIVILEGES via unix_socket. There are no other user databases present.",
  "plan": "You should tell me exactly what you want next. Options (pick one):\n\n1) Have me run a SQL query here and return the results. Provide the SQL or a natural-language question (examples I can run immediately):\n   - \"Show all employees.\" -> SELECT * FROM company.employees;\n   - \"Show employees with salary > 90000.\" -> SELECT * FROM company.employees WHERE salary > 90000;\n   - \"Count employees by role.\" -> SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM company.employees GROUP BY role;\n\n   If you choose this, I will execute the SQL locally using the socket and return the raw output.\n\n2) Have me produce a single SQL statement for you to execute (Action: Operation). If you want that, specify the exact question/goal and I will reply with exactly one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block prefixed by \"Action: Operation\" (you must execute only the SQL in the first code block I provide).\n\n3) Create or modify schema / insert more data. Tell me the schema/data and I will run the necessary SQL locally.\n\n4) Enable TCP networking / allow remote connections (I can restart MariaDB without --skip-networking). Only choose this if you want remote access.\n\nTell me which option you want and provide any needed details (the SQL to run or the question). I will then either run the SQL here and return results or output the single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format.",
