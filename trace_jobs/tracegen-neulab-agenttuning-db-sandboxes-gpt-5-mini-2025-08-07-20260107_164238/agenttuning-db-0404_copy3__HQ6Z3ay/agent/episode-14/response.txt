  "analysis": "I connected to the local MariaDB server via the Unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and inspected users and privileges. There are three accounts: mariadb.sys@localhost, mysql@localhost, and root@localhost. SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost' shows the root account has ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* and can authenticate either via unix_socket or mysql_native_password (the client-facing password field shows 'invalid' as a placeholder). The server was started with --skip-networking, so it only accepts local socket connections. There are only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and no user databases yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you tell me which action you want. Here are the reasonable next steps you can choose from; pick one and I will proceed exactly as you require.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Ask me to run a specific SQL query now on the local server. If you want me to run it here, tell me the exact SQL and I will execute it using the local socket and return results. I will run the mysql client command locally (no Action: Operation block needed in that case).\n\n2) Ask me to produce exactly one SQL statement for you to execute yourself (Action: Operation). If you want that, tell me the question/goal and the target database/table. I will reply with a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block prefixed by \"Action: Operation\" (per your protocol). You must execute only the SQL in the first code block I provide.\n\n3) Create a new database/table and seed sample data locally. Tell me the database name, table schema and sample rows (or say to create a small example) and I will create them and then run any queries you request.\n\n4) Import a SQL dump or CSV: provide the path to the file (or upload it) and I will import it into a database (I can create one), then run queries you request.\n\n5) Enable TCP networking on the server (so remote connections are possible). I can restart MariaDB without --skip-networking and open port 3306, but that changes server startup and may require additional steps. Only proceed if you want remote access enabled.\n\nNotes and suggestions based on current state:\n- As root@localhost via unix_socket, I can create databases, users, and any tables. If your goal is to ask queries about data, either provide a dump or let me create sample data.\n- If you want me to craft a single SQL statement for you to execute remotely, give me the exact question (for example: \"List all tables in database mydb\" or \"SELECT name FROM employees WHERE id=5\") and the target database name.\n\nTell me which option you choose and any needed details (SQL to run, DB name, schema/data, or remote connection info). I will then either (A) run commands here and return results, or (B) produce the one-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run yourself.",
