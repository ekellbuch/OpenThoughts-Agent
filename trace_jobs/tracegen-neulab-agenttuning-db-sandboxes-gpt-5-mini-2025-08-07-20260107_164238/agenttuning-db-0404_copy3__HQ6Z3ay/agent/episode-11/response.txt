  "analysis": "The local MariaDB server is installed and running and is reachable via the Unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. I connected as root and listed databases; only the built-in system databases exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user-created databases or tables to query. You have not given a specific question or requested a particular operation yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want done next. Possible next actions (pick one or describe another):\n\n- Ask me to run an exploratory query here (I can run it locally and return results). Examples:\n  * List all databases: SHOW DATABASES; (already done).\n  * List users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n  * Show tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n  * Describe a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table;\n  * Run any SELECT you specify.\n\n- Ask me to produce a single SQL statement for you to execute remotely (I will output exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block as you require). If you want that, specify the target database/table and the question.\n\n- Ask me to create a new database/table and insert data (specify schema/data) or to import a dump/CSV (provide path or upload). I can perform those actions locally and then run queries.\n\nNotes on how I'll execute SQL here: I will use the mysql client with the socket: mysql -u root -S /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer a TCP-enabled server, I can restart MariaDB without --skip-networking (tell me).\n\nTell me which action you want. If you want me to produce an Action: Operation SQL block for you to run, state the exact query goal and the target database/table names and I will respond with the single SQL statement in the required format. If you want me to run SQL here, tell me the SQL or the goal and I will execute it and return the raw output.",
