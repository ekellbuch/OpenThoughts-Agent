SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; returned three accounts: mariadb.sys@localhost, mysql@localhost, and root@localhost. No user-created databases or tables exist yet. To know what operations are possible as root, the next useful step is to inspect the privileges/grants for the root@localhost account.",

I will use the local mysql client connecting via the Unix socket and run: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; Expect output listing privileges (e.g., ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FOR 'root'@'localhost', or more restricted grants). Based on that result I will propose the next SQL operation (create DB, inspect tables, or run queries).",
