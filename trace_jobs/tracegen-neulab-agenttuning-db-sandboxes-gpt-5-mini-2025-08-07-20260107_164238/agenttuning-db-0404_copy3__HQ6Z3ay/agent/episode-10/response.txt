  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running locally and is reachable via the Unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. I connected as root and listed databases; only the default system databases exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user-created databases or tables yet. You have not yet asked a specific question about the database or provided data to load.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the next action. You can choose one of these:\n\n- Provide a specific question about the database (e.g., \"list all users\", \"show tables in database X\", \"run SELECT ... on table Y\"). If you want me to produce a SQL statement for you to execute, I'll output exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) as you required. You will run it and return the raw MySQL output.\n\n- Ask me to run SQL here in the container. If so, tell me which query to run or ask me to perform exploratory queries (examples: SHOW DATABASES;, SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;, SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;). I'll run the mysql client locally and return the results.\n\n- Ask me to create a new database/table and seed it with data (specify schema/data), or to import a SQL dump/CSV (provide file path or upload the file). I'll create the DB and run queries as requested.\n\nNotes about the workflow and constraints:\n- If you want a SQL statement from me to execute yourself, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block preceded by \"Action: Operation\"; you must execute only the SQL in the first code block you receive.\n- If you want me to execute SQL here, I will run mysql -u root -S /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" locally and return the output.\n\nTell me which option you choose and, if applicable, provide the target database/table names, connection details (for remote DB), or the exact question/query you want answered. Once you respond I will either (A) emit the Action: Operation SQL statement for you to run, or (B) run the requested SQL here and return the results.",
