  "analysis": "So far the mysql client is installed in the container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally and no remote connection details have been provided. To be able to execute SQL here I must either connect to an existing server (you provide host/port/user/password) or install and start a local database server. Since no choice was given, I'll proceed to install and start a local MariaDB server so we can run queries locally and you can ask SQL questions to be executed here.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists (apt-get update). 2) Install mariadb-server (apt-get install -y mariadb-server). 3) Try to start the server with the init script/service command. 4) If the service startup doesn't register with systemctl in this container environment, start mysqld_safe directly as a fallback. 5) Verify the server is running (ps aux) and run a simple test query (mysql -e 'SELECT VERSION();') to confirm connectivity via the mysql client. After that, I will be ready to accept your SQL question and will produce the required single-line SQL statement in the Action: Operation format for you to run or will run further SQL here as you instruct.",
