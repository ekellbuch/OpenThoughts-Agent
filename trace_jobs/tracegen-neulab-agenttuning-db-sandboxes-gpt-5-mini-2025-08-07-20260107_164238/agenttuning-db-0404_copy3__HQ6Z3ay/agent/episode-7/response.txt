  "analysis": "MariaDB is now installed and running in this container. The server was started with mysqld_safe --skip-networking, so it is reachable only via the local Unix socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client is installed and can execute statements (example: mysql -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" returned 10.11.13-MariaDB...). No user-created databases or tables have been inspected yet; only the server startup was performed. Because skip-networking is enabled, remote TCP connections are disabled; all SQL must be run locally with the mysql client using the socket (or by removing --skip-networking and restarting the server).",
  "plan": "I am ready to run SQL against the local MariaDB instance. Per your described protocol, when you give me a question I will either (A) produce an Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block for you to execute, or (B) if you want me to run SQL here directly, I will run a mysql client command locally. Before issuing any SQL, confirm what you want answered (examples below). If you want me to run SQL here now, tell me which of the following you'd like done and I will proceed:\n\n- List databases so we can see what's present (I would run SHOW DATABASES;).\n- Use a specific database and list its tables (I would run SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;).\n- Run a custom SELECT query you specify.\n- Create a database/user and/or load data (specify schema or data).\n\nNotes on how I'll connect locally: to run SQL here I will use the mysql client and the socket, e.g. mysql -u root -S /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer TCP networking I can reconfigure/start the server without --skip-networking (ask me to do that).",
