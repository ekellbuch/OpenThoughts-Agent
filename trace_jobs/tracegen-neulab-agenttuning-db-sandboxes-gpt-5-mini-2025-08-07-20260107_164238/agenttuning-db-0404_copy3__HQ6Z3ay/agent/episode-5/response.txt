  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (verified earlier) but there is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/run/mysqld, no mysql process) and you have not provided any remote MySQL connection details. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database endpoint. The session is idle at the /app prompt.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of the following paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (if not default 3306), username, password (or indicate an auth method such as SSL/key), and the database name (if applicable). Also state the exact question you want answered from that database.\n- I will then produce a single SQL statement in the required one-line markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to run with your mysql client. You will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back to me, and I will analyze it and continue as needed.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and start a server here. Optionally specify root password and/or a non-root user and database to create (or say to use defaults).\n- If you confirm, I will run apt to install a server (or mariadb-server), initialize and start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries locally. After the server is available I will produce the single SQL statement you request (Action: Operation) to be executed and will analyze the returned output.\n\nOption C — Provide a SQL dump or CSV/data file to load here:\n- Upload or indicate the path to the dump/data and tell me the query you want. I will import it locally (after installing server if needed) and then run the query.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide any required credentials or preferences. Once you reply I will either (A) generate the exact one-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to execute against your server, or (B) run commands here to install/start a local server and then run queries.",
