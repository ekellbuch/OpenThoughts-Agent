  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt in /app with no previous commands run in this session (the terminal shows only the shell prompt). No MySQL query or database activity has been performed yet. Before I can run SQL against a MySQL instance I need to discover whether a MySQL server or client is available in this environment, whether there's a Unix socket or network port to connect to, and any relevant credentials or environment variables. Right now none of that is known.",
  "plan": "I will inspect the filesystem and running processes to locate a MySQL server or client and find connection endpoints (socket or port) and any environment variables that may contain credentials. Steps and expected outcomes:\n1) pwd and ls -la to confirm working directory and list files in /app (see if project contains DB credentials or scripts).\n2) mysql --version to check if the MySQL client is installed.\n3) ls -la /var/run/mysqld to see if a MySQL socket file exists (common location for server socket).\n4) ps aux | grep -i mysql to see if a MySQL server process is running and on what user/args.\n5) env | grep -i mysql to check for env vars like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST, etc.\nBased on the results I will propose the next command to connect (a SQL statement to run) or further discovery steps. Each command is chosen to be safe and quick to execute.",
