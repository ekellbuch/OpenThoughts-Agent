  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL server accessible from this container: no /var/run/mysqld socket and no mysql process. Therefore I cannot run any SQL yet. I need either connection details for an existing remote MySQL server (host, port, username, password or a client-auth method, and database name) or permission to install and start a local database server here so I can create or query databases locally. You have not yet asked a specific SQL question to answer against a database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following options and then proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (preferred if one exists):\n- You provide connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password (or an auth method), and database name (if relevant).\n- I will produce a single SQL statement (in the required one-line markdown code block format) to run against that database to get the information you request. You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, and I will analyze it and iterate as needed.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (only if you want me to):\n- I will install and initialize a local server (eg. mariadb-server or mysql-server), start it, and create a user/database if needed. Then I can run SQL queries locally.\n- If you want this, confirm and specify any desired initial credentials or whether I should create a root password and/or a non-root user/database and what schema/data to populate.\n\nOption C — If you have a specific SQL question but will not provide connection details, describe the question and provide a dump or sample of the database (or grant access) so I can proceed.\n\nTell me which option you choose and, for Option A, provide connection details (or the socket path) and the exact question you want answered. For Option B, say I should proceed and provide any preferred credentials or accept defaults.\n\nI will not run any further commands until you confirm which path to take.",
