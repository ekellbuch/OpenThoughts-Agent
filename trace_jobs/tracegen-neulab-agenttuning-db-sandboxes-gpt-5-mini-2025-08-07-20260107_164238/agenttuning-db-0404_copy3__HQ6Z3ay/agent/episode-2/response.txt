  "plan": "I need either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server you want me to query (host, port, username, password or other auth, and target database), or (B) permission to install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here so I can create/query databases locally. Describe which option you prefer. If you provide connection details, I will: 1) run a mysql client command to connect (or test connection) and then 2) when you ask a specific question about the DB, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required one-line markdown code block (Action: Operation) which you will execute and return the output for me to analyze. If you prefer a local server, I will attempt to install and start one and then create sample data or connect to it and run queries.",
