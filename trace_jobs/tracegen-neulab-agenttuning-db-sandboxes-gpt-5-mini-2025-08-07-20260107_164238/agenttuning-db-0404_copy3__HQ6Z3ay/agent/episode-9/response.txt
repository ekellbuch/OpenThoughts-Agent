Options:\n\n1) Query the server for users or privileges (I can run a SQL statement like SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;).\n2) Create a new database and tables and insert sample data (tell me schema/data or ask me to create a simple example).\n3) Load a SQL dump or CSV into the server (provide the file path or upload the dump here).\n4) If you intended to query an existing remote database instead of this local server, provide its connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the question you want answered.\n\nIf you choose an action that requires a SQL statement, tell me which option and the exact question; I will then produce the required Action: Operation block containing a single SQL statement (one-line in a markdown code block) for you to execute. Alternatively, if you want me to run SQL here directly, tell me which of the options above to perform and I will run the appropriate mysql -e command locally.",
