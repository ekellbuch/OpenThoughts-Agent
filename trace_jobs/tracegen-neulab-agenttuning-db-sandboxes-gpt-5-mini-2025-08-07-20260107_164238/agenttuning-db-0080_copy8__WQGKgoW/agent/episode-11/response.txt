  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working in the container (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no processes, no /var/run/mysqld socket), and no remote connection credentials or question have been provided. I cannot execute any SQL because there is no reachable server or credentials. I have repeatedly prompted you to either provide remote connection details plus the exact question to answer, or to reply exactly 'install local server' to permit installing and starting a local database server. No choice has been made yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to explicitly choose one of the two options below. After you reply I will proceed as described.\n\nOption 1 (remote server): Provide remote connection details and the exact question to answer. Include: host, port (optional, default 3306), user, password (or say 'prompt'), database name, and the precise query intent (for example: \"count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\"). Once you provide that, I will prepare a single SQL statement (one-liner in a single SQL code block) for you to execute; you will paste the raw MySQL output and I will parse it and continue as needed.\n\nOption 2 (local server): Reply exactly with the text: install local server\n\nIf you choose that, I will install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in this container (state-changing), initialize it, and then run the exploratory or requested SQL. I will not take any state-changing actions until you explicitly reply with option 2.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one of: 1) the remote connection info plus the exact question, OR 2) the single phrase: install local server.",
