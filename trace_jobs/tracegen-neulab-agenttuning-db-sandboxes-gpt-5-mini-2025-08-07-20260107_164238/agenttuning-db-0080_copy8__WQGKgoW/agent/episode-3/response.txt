  "analysis": "We have a working mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) installed in the container. There is no MySQL server detected (no processes, no socket) and no credentials or environment variables pointing to a remote server. Therefore I cannot run any SQL yet because there is no reachable server or credentials. The situation: ready client, but missing connection details or an explicit instruction to install/start a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the question to answer and the database connection information. Please tell me: 1) the question you want answered (what table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or the high-level query intent), and 2) connection details — host (or 'localhost'), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say that I should prompt interactively), and database name. Alternatively, if you want a local server: tell me to install and initialize mariadb-server (I will install and start it, which is a state-changing operation). Once you provide connection details and the question I will: - think through the schema discovery steps (SHOW DATABASES, USE db, SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE table) if needed, - craft a single SQL statement to run (I will follow your rule: every operation message must include a single SQL statement in a markdown code block), - you will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back to me, and I will iterate if necessary. If you prefer, supply a read-only credential and I will prepare the first SQL statement immediately.",
