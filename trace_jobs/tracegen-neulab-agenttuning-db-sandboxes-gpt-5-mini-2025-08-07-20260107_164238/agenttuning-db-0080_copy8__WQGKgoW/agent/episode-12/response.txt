  "analysis": "The container has a functioning mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no server processes, no /var/run/mysqld socket), and there are no credentials or configuration files (~/.my.cnf) or environment variables pointing to a remote server. I cannot run any SQL because there is no reachable server or provided credentials. You must either supply remote connection details (host, optional port, user, password or 'prompt', database) plus the exact question to answer, or explicitly request that I install and start a local database server in this container (state-changing).",
  "plan": "Ask you to choose one of two explicit options so I can proceed:\n- Option A (remote server): Provide remote connection info and the exact question to answer. I will then craft a single SQL statement for you to execute. Please include: host, port (optional; default 3306), username, password (or 'prompt'), database name, and the precise query intent (e.g., \"count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\").\n- Option B (local server): Respond exactly with: install local server\n  If you choose this I will install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server (state-changing), initialize it, and then run exploratory or specific SQL as you direct.\nI will not perform state-changing actions or attempt connections without your explicit choice. After you reply with one of the above, I will prepare the next single SQL operation or install/start the server as requested.",
