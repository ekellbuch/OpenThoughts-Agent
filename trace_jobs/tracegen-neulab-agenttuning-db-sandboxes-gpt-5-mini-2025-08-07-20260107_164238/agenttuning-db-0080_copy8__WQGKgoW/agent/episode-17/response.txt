The server is running (mariadbd process is present) and mysql -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned the system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user databases exist yet. There is no root password set (we connected as root non-interactively), so we can run SQL locally as root using mysql -e \"...\". No user-provided question or target database/table has been given yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further SQL until you specify the exact question you want answered. Options you can choose now:\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"count rows in table orders where status = 'shipped'\", or \"list id, name from users where active=1 order by created_at desc\"). I will then produce a single SQL statement (one-liner in a code block) for you to execute. You can run it locally with the mysql client (we can run it here as root with mysql -e).\n- Ask me to inspect the current schema. I can run one exploratory SQL statement (remember: only one SQL statement per round) such as SHOW DATABASES; (already done), SHOW TABLES FROM db;, or SELECT ... FROM db.table LIMIT 10;. Tell me which exploratory query to run and I will format it exactly as required.\n- If you want a new test database/table, say so and I will create one and populate it (this is state-changing and will be done only if you explicitly request it).\n\nWhen you specify your choice, I will either (A) prepare one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute, or (B) run a shell mysql -e command here if you explicitly ask me to operate now. For clarity: if you want me to operate now, tell me the single SQL to run or ask me to discover schema (and which DB to inspect).",
