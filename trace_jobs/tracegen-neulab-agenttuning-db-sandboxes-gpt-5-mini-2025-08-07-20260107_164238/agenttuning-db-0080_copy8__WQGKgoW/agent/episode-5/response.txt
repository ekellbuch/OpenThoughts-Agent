I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or explicitly ask me to install and start a local database server in this container. Previous prompts requesting that information have been printed but you have not yet chosen an option.",
  "plan": "I'll wait for your decision. Please reply with one of the following options:\n\n1) Provide remote connection details and the exact question you want answered: host, port (optional), user, password (or say 'prompt'), and database name. Once you provide that, I will prepare a single SQL statement for you to run.\n\n2) Reply with the exact phrase: install local server\n\n   If you choose this, I will: install mariadb-server, initialize the data directory (insecure initialization so root has no password), start the server in the background, and then connect locally as root to run SQL. After starting the server I will run exploratory SQL (SHOW DATABASES) or the specific SQL you request. Note: this is state-changing.\n\nPlease choose one of the above. I will not proceed until you explicitly choose.",
