At this point we have a client available but no database connection details or a running server to talk to. To run SQL I need a MySQL server host (or to install/start a local server) and credentials (user, password, port, database) or a ~/.my.cnf with credentials. I have not yet executed any SQL because no connection information was provided.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the database connection details and the question you want answered. Please tell me: 1) the question you want answered (what data/aggregation/filtering you expect), and 2) connection info: host (or 'localhost'), port (default 3306), user, password (or tell me to use interactive prompt), and database name (or tell me to list databases). If you prefer a local server, say so and I can install and start mariadb-server (that is an additional, potentially state-changing operation). Once you provide connection details I will: - run a single SQL statement (you will execute the first SQL code block I provide) to retrieve the requested data; - parse the returned MySQL output you give me; - iterate with more SQL if needed until we can produce the final answer. Example connection test command you can run (or I can run if you give credentials): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pDBPASSWORD DATABASE -e \"SELECT 1;\" . If you want me to attempt an automatic connection test now, provide the credentials or allow me to attempt connecting to localhost as root (no password).",
