I cannot run any SQL because there is no reachable server or provided credentials. I have repeatedly requested that you either supply remote connection details plus the exact question to answer, or explicitly allow installing a local server by replying exactly 'install local server'. No choice has been made yet, so no SQL operations can be executed.",
  "plan": "Prompt you one final time to choose exactly one of two options so I can proceed:\n1) Provide remote connection details and the exact question to answer (host, optional port, user, password or 'prompt', database) — I will then prepare a single SQL statement for you to run. 2) Reply exactly 'install local server' — I will install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (state-changing) and then run exploratory or requested SQL. I will not take any further action until you explicitly choose one of these options.",
