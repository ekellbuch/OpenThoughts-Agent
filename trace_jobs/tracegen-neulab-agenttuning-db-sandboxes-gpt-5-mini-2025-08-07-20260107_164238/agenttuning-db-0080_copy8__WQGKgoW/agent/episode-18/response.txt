I will then prepare a single SQL statement (one-liner in a code block) for you to execute. \n\n2) Ask me to run one exploratory SQL statement now (I can run a single statement such as SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; or SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT 10; — tell me which database/table to inspect). I will format that single SQL statement for you to execute.\n\n3) Say: create test database — and I will create a sample database and table and populate it (state-changing). I will run one SQL statement at a time as you require.\n\nTell me which option you choose and any necessary details (database/table names, filters, columns, etc.).",
