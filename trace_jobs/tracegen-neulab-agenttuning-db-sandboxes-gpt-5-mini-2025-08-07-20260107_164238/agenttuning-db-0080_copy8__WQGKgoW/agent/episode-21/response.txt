I will prepare that one SQL statement for you to execute.\n3) Reply exactly: create test database — I will create a sample database/table and populate it (state-changing). I will perform actions only after you explicitly choose one of these options.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (database/table names, filters, columns, etc.).",
