  "analysis": "The apt install of mariadb-server started and package downloads/configuration are in progress (the terminal shows package list and initial download progress). We need to wait for the installation to finish, ensure dpkg is configured, start the MySQL/MariaDB service, verify the mysqld process is running, and then test connectivity by running a simple SQL statement (SHOW DATABASES;). At that point we will have a local server available and can proceed to run queries for your question. Currently the installation was mid-progress in the terminal output, so the next steps are to detect whether apt/dpkg are still running, finish any pending configuration, start the service, and run a connectivity test.",
  "plan": "1) Pause briefly to allow the package installer to progress. 2) Check for running apt/dpkg processes. 3) If any package configuration is still pending, run dpkg --configure -a and apt-get -f install -y to finish configuration. 4) Ensure /var/run/mysqld exists and is owned by mysql:mysql. 5) Start the mysql service. 6) Verify the mysqld process is running. 7) Run a simple SQL connectivity test: SHOW DATABASES;. Based on the output, I'll know the server is up and can then ask for the exact question or proceed to run the SQL you request.",
