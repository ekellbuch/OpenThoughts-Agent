I will then produce a single SQL statement (one-liner) for you to execute. \n2) Ask for one exploratory SQL statement to run now (for example: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; or SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; or SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT 10;). I will prepare exactly one SQL statement for you to run. \n3) Reply exactly: create test database — I will create a sample database/table and populate it (state-changing) and then we can run queries against it.\n\nI will not run any SQL until you pick one of these options.
