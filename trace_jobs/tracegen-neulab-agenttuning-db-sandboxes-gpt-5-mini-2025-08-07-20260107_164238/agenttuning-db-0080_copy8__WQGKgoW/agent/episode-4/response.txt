  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) in this container. There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no processes, no socket), there are no credentials or .my.cnf present, and no environment variables referring to a remote DB. I cannot run any SQL until I have a reachable server and credentials (either a remote host/port/user/password/database or permission to install and start a local server).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the question you want answered plus connection details. Please choose one of these options and provide the requested info:\n\n1) Connect to a remote MySQL server you control — provide: host, port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' if you want to enter it interactively), and database name; and also tell me the exact question (for example: \"list all users with > 1000 points\", or \"count rows in table orders where status = 'shipped'\"). Once you provide that, I will prepare a single SQL statement to run (you will execute it and paste the raw MySQL output back to me).\n\n2) Install and run a local server in this container — if you choose this, reply 'install local server' and I will install mariadb-server (or mysql-server if preferred) and attempt to initialize/start it, then create/open a DB for queries. Note this is state-changing and may require additional configuration (setting a root password or creating a test user).\n\n3) If you'd rather explore the schema first, provide connection details (as in #1) and I will prepare a single SQL statement such as SHOW DATABASES; or, if you want me to probe schema locally after installing a server, choose option #2.\n\nOnce you give the connection choice and the question, I will craft exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the MySQL output, I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.",
