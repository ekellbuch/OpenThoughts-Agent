There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no processes, no socket) and you have not provided remote connection credentials or the question to answer.

  "plan": "I will wait for you to explicitly choose one of two options. Provide your choice by replying in the terminal with exactly one of the options below. Do not proceed until you choose:\n\nOption A (connect to a remote server): Reply with the remote connection details and the exact question to answer. Include: host, port (optional, default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say 'prompt' to input interactively), and database name. Also describe the exact result you want (for example: \"count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\" or \"list id and name from users where active=1 ordered by created_at desc\"). After you provide that, I will prepare a single SQL statement for you to run.\n\nOption B (install a local server): Reply exactly with: install local server\n\nIf you choose Option B, I will install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in this container (state-changing), initialize it, and then run exploratory SQL or the specific query you request. If you choose Option A, I will craft one SQL statement to run against the provided server. I will not take any further action until you explicitly reply with one of these options.",
