There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, no ~/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with DB credentials. I cannot execute any SQL against a database until you either: (A) provide remote connection details (host, optional port, user, password or 'prompt', database) along with the exact question to answer, or (B) explicitly request that I install and start a local server by replying exactly 'install local server'. So far you have not made either choice.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your explicit decision. Please reply with one of the following exact options:\n\n1) Provide remote connection info and the exact question you want answered. Give: host, port (optional), user, password (or 'prompt'), database, and describe the query or result you need (for example: \"count rows in table orders where status = 'shipped'\"). After you provide this, I will craft a single SQL statement for you to run and will process the returned MySQL output.\n\n2) Reply exactly: install local server\n\nIf you choose option 2 I will install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server (state-changing) and then proceed to run exploratory SQL or the specific query you ask for. I will not take action until you choose. Below I reprint the prompt so you can respond from the terminal.",
