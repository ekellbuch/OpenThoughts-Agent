I will then craft a single SQL statement (one-liner in a code block) for you to execute. \n2) Ask me to run one exploratory SQL statement now (examples: \"SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\" or \"SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\"). I will prepare exactly one SQL statement for you to run. \n3) Reply exactly: create test database — I will create a sample database/table and populate it (state-changing).
