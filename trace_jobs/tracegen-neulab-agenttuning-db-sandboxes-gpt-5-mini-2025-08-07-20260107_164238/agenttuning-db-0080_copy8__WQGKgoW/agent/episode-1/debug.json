There is no MySQL output provided and no question from the user yet. I cannot see whether a MySQL server or client is present on this container or what credentials/configuration might exist. To proceed I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB client is available, whether a server is running, and whether there are any local configuration files or environment variables providing credentials.\",\n  \"plan\": \"I will run a short sequence of read-only inspection commands to discover the environment and MySQL availability/configuration. Specifically:\\n- list files in the current directory to see project files (ls -la)\\n- print working directory (pwd)\\n- check for a MySQL client binary (mysql --version)\\n- check for a mysqladmin binary and server processes (mysqladmin version and ps aux | grep mysql) to detect a running server\\n- inspect common MySQL runtime/socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) to see if a server socket exists\\n- look for a ~/.my.cnf file which may contain client credentials\\n- list environment variables that mention mysql to find credentials passed via env\\nThese steps will give the information needed to decide the next SQL operation. I will not modify the database yet; only gather information.

There is no MySQL client installed (mysql and mysqladmin not found), no MySQL/MariaDB server process running, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no ~/.my.cnf with credentials, and no environment variables mentioning MySQL. In short: there is no client available to run SQL, and no local server detected. Before I can execute any SQL against a MySQL server I need a client and a reachable server (either local or remote with credentials). The next step is to install a MySQL client in the container (or use the distro package manager to add a client) so I can run SQL statements. If you intend to target a remote MySQL server, provide the host, port, user, and password; otherwise I will attempt to install a client so we can connect to a server if available or install one later.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"1) Inspect the OS release to choose the package manager. 2) Install a MySQL client using the container's package manager: apt (default-mysql-client), apk (mysql-client), or yum (mariadb). I will run a small shell conditional that detects the package manager and installs an appropriate client. 3) Verify installation by running mysql --version. After that, I'll ask you for the database host and credentials or attempt to connect to a local server if one appears.
