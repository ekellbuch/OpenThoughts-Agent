  "analysis": "From the previous commands: the container current directory /app is empty. There is no MySQL client installed (mysql and mysqladmin not found), no MySQL/MariaDB server process running, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no ~/.my.cnf with credentials, and no environment variables mentioning MySQL. In short: there is no client available to run SQL, and no local server detected. Before I can execute any SQL against a MySQL server I need a client and a reachable server (either local or remote with credentials). The next step is to install a MySQL client in the container (or use the distro package manager to add a client) so I can run SQL statements. If you intend to target a remote MySQL server, provide the host, port, user, and password; otherwise I will attempt to install a client so we can connect to a server if available or install one later.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the OS release to choose the package manager. 2) Install a MySQL client using the container's package manager: apt (default-mysql-client), apk (mysql-client), or yum (mariadb). I will run a small shell conditional that detects the package manager and installs an appropriate client. 3) Verify installation by running mysql --version. After that, I'll ask you for the database host and credentials or attempt to connect to a local server if one appears. The commands are non-destructive (installation only) and will let me run SQL in subsequent steps.",
