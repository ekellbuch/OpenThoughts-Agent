  "analysis": "The terminal shows a root prompt in /app with an initial bash warning about job control; no commands have been run yet in this session. There is no MySQL output provided and no question from the user yet. I cannot see whether a MySQL server or client is present on this container or what credentials/configuration might exist. To proceed I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB client is available, whether a server is running, and whether there are any local configuration files or environment variables providing credentials.",
  "plan": "I will run a short sequence of read-only inspection commands to discover the environment and MySQL availability/configuration. Specifically:\n- list files in the current directory to see project files (ls -la)\n- print working directory (pwd)\n- check for a MySQL client binary (mysql --version)\n- check for a mysqladmin binary and server processes (mysqladmin version and ps aux | grep mysql) to detect a running server\n- inspect common MySQL runtime/socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) to see if a server socket exists\n- look for a ~/.my.cnf file which may contain client credentials\n- list environment variables that mention mysql to find credentials passed via env\nThese steps will give the information needed to decide the next SQL operation. I will not modify the database yet; only gather information. Each command is short and non-destructive.",
