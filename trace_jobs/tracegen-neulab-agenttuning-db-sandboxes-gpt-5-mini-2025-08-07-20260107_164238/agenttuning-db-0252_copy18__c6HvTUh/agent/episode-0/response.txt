  "analysis": "We have an interactive shell (root@989a24fc2723:/app#) with no prior actions taken. There's no visible MySQL activity yet. To answer database questions I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running in this container, whether a mysql client is available, and whether I can connect as root (or another user). Nothing has been executed yet in this session.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect current working directory and files to see if database files or configuration are present. 2) Check running processes for MySQL/MariaDB. 3) Check listening ports for 3306. 4) Check whether the mysql client is installed and its version. 5) Attempt to connect as root without a password and run a simple SHOW DATABASES; query to enumerate databases. Each step will reveal necessary information to proceed with SQL operations.",
