  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered and include any database and table names and filters/limits. Once you give a concrete request I will: 1) explain my understanding and approach; 2) either 'Operate' (provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format — a single-line SQL in a SQL code block) or 'Answer' (if no SQL is needed); 3) you will run the single SQL I provide and return the raw MySQL output; 4) I will analyze that output and continue with further single-statement operations or produce the final answer with Action: Answer.\n\nIf you need examples to choose from, here are valid requests (replace names as needed):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data)\n\nTell me exactly which query or action you want (including database/table names and any WHERE or LIMIT clauses).",
