A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no application-specific databases or tables inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target for querying. No further SQL has been executed since the test SHOW DATABASES;.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, show a table's CREATE statement, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). Once you provide the specific request I will:\n1) Explain my understanding of the question and the SQL I'll run.\n2) Choose to 'Operate' and provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside an Action: Operation SQL code block as you required. You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output. \n3) I will analyze the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when ready.\n\nExamples you can request (please include database and table names when applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type='login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data)\n\nPlease state the exact question and any database/table names or filters. After you do, I will provide the single SQL statement to execute.",
