A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no application-specific SQL queries pending and no question from you yet about the database contents or schema.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to give a concrete question about the database (for example: list tables in a database, show a table's schema, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). When you provide the question I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and the exact SQL I'll run. 2) Either choose to 'Operate' (in which case I'll provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format) or choose to 'Answer' if no further SQL is needed. \n\nPlease tell me exactly what you want me to do and include database and table names (if applicable). Example requests you can pick or adapt:\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events where type='login'\"\n- \"Update mydb.settings set value='x' where name='y'\" (this modifies data)\n\nOnce you provide the specific question, I will produce a single SQL statement for you to execute and will then analyze the output you return.",
