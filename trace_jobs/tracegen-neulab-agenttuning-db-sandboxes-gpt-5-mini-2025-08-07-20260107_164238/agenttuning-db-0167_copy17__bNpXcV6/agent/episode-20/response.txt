  "analysis": "The last terminal output shows mysqld_safe messages: \"Number of processes running now: 0\" and \"mysqld restarted\" — indicating the server attempted a restart. I should verify the server is currently running, check the MySQL socket directory, inspect recent error log entries to confirm successful startup, and then run a simple SQL query (SHOW DATABASES;) to confirm connectivity and list databases. No application-specific question has been given yet, so this is a health-check + reconnect step to ensure the server is up before proceeding with any further SQL operations.",
  "plan": "1) Check running processes to confirm mysqld is active. 2) List /var/run/mysqld to confirm the socket file exists. 3) Tail the recent MySQL error log to see latest startup messages and any errors. 4) Connect using the mysql client and run SHOW DATABASES; to verify we can connect and to list available databases. Each command is chosen to validate server status and connectivity before any further operations.",
