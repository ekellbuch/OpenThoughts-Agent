  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container (started with mysqld_safe). The mysql client is available. A test SHOW DATABASES; previously returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific queries have been run since that test, and I have no user-provided question yet to answer with SQL.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific question you want answered about the database (for example: list tables in a database, show a table's schema, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). Once you provide the question I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and chosen approach. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (one-line, in a SQL code block) for you to execute. 3) After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer.\n\nExamples you can ask:\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"COUNT rows in mydb.events where type='login'\"\n- \"Update mydb.settings set value='x' where name='y'\" (this modifies data)\n\nPlease state the exact question and, if applicable, the target database and table names.",
