A prior quick test returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no application-specific databases or tables inspected because you have not given a concrete question or target (database/table/condition) for me to query. No further SQL has been run since the test SHOW DATABASES;.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, show a table schema, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). Once you provide a concrete request I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the SQL I'll run; 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block); 3) You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; 4) I will analyze the output and iterate until we reach the final answer. Examples of valid requests you can give: \"List tables in database mydb\", \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\", \"Count rows in mydb.events where type='login'\", or an UPDATE statement if you want to modify data. Please state the exact question and, if applicable, database and table names.",
