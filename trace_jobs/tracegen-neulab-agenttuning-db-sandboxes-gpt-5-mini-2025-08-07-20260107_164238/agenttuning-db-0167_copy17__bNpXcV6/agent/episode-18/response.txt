  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed in the container. I started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe; the server process is running and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A test query SHOW DATABASES; previously returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a concrete question or target to query. No further SQL has been executed since that test.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact question you want answered about the MySQL instance (include database and table names if applicable). Possible requests include: \"List tables in database mydb\", \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\", \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type='login'\", or an UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT statement if you want to modify data. Once you provide the exact request I will: (1) explain my understanding and approach, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze the output and continue iterating until we reach the final answer.",
