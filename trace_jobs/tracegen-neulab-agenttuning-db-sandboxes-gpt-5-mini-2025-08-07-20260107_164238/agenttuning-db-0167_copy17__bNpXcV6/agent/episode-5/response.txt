  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container (mysqld was started with mysqld_safe). The mysql client is available. A quick test SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no application-specific databases shown. I have not executed any further SQL beyond that test. To proceed I need a concrete question about the database (for example: list tables in a specific database, show the schema of a table, count rows meeting a condition, select rows from a table, or perform an update).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific question you want answered about the MySQL instance. When you provide the question I will:\n1) Explain my understanding of the question, the relevant tables/databases to inspect, and the exact SQL needed. 2) Choose either to 'Operate' (run a single SQL statement) or to 'Answer' (if no SQL is needed).\n\nIf you choose to operate, I will supply exactly one SQL statement (one-line) inside the required Action: Operation block in the next message. That SQL will be the only statement you should execute; after you run it and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the results and either run another single SQL statement in a subsequent round or produce the final answer.\n\nTo help you formulate the question, here are examples of things you might ask me to do (pick one and give any needed names/filters):\n- \"List tables in database X\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE for X.table_name\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM X.table_name WHERE id = 123 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in X.table_name where status = 'active'\"\n- \"Update X.table_name set column = value where condition\" (note: this modifies data)\n\nTell me which of the above (or another) you want, and include the target database and table names if applicable. After you provide the question I will produce the single SQL statement to run.",
