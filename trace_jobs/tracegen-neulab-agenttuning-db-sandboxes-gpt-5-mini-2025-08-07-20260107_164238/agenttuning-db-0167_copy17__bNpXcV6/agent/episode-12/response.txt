  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe and verified the server process, socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), and a test query that returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact question you want answered about the MySQL instance. Examples you can choose or adapt (include target database/table names where applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type = 'login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data)\n\nOnce you provide the exact request I will: (1) explain my approach, and (2) supply exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (single-line SQL in a SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the results and continue with further single-statement operations or produce the final answer.",
