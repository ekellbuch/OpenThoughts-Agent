  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container (mysqld was started via mysqld_safe). The UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The server has recently restarted but is currently ready for connections and responds to queries. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet provided a concrete question or target to query. The environment is ready for SQL operations.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered and include database and table names (and any filters/limits) if applicable. Examples you can request (please include exact database/table names when applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\" -> I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM mydb; to list tables.\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\" -> I'll run SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.users; to get the schema.\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\" -> I'll run that SELECT to fetch rows.\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\" -> I'll run that COUNT query.\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data) -> I'll run that single UPDATE.\n\nWhen you give the exact question I will:\n1) Briefly explain my understanding and the SQL I will run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the Action: Operation format you requested (i.e., a SQL code block with one statement). You should execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me. 3) I will analyze the output and iterate with another single SQL or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when I'm sure of the result.\n\nTell me the precise query or task (include database and table names and any WHERE/limit clauses), and I will prepare the single SQL statement to run.",
