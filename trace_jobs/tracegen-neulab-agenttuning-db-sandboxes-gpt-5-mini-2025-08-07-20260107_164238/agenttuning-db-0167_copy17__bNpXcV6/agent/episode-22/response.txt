The socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a concrete question or target to query. The environment is ready for SQL operations.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered (include database and table names and any filter/limit). Examples: \"List tables in database mydb\", \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\", \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\", or an UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT statement if you want to modify data. Once you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL inside a SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the results and continue.",
