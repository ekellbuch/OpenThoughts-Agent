  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe; the server process is active and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or data have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target yet. Nothing further needs to be done at the shell level until you tell me what you want to query or modify in the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to give a single, concrete database question (for example: list tables in a database, show CREATE TABLE for a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the approach I will take. 2) If operating, produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: an Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block. Important: you will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return its raw MySQL output to me. 3) I will analyze the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern. If you're unsure what to ask, here are examples you can choose (replace mydb/table names as needed):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (note: modifies data)\n\nPlease state your exact question and include the target database and table names (and any filters).",
