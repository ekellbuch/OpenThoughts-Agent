The socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target to query yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements from you.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered, including any database and table names and any filters/limits. Once you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and the exact SQL I will run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nExamples you can ask (please include the exact database/table names when applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data)\n\nWhen you provide a specific request, I will follow your required workflow and produce one SQL statement to run.",
