  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. mysqld was started manually (mysqld_safe) and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific database, table, or data has been queried because you have not provided a specific question or target yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (include database and table names if applicable). Examples you can request: \"List tables in database mydb\", \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\", \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type='login'\", or an UPDATE statement to modify data. Once you give a concrete request I will: (1) explain my approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL in a single code block) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
