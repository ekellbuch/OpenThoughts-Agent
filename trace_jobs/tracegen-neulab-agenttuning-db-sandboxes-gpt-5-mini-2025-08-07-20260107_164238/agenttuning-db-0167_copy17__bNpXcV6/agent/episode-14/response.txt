  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe; the server process and socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) exist. A prior test query returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target for querying.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, show a table's CREATE statement, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). Once you provide the specific request I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL I will run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside an Action: Operation SQL code block for you to execute. After you run that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the result and either issue another single SQL or produce the final answer.\n\nIf helpful, here are example requests you can choose or adapt — include the database and table names when applicable:\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type = 'login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (this modifies data)\n\nPlease specify exactly which of the above (or another) you want and provide the database/table names or filter conditions.",
