  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container (started via mysqld_safe). The mysql client is available. A previous test query returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no application-specific databases or tables inspected because you haven't provided a specific question yet. No SQL statements have been executed since the test SHOW DATABASES; that returned the system databases.",
  "plan": "I need a concrete question from you about the database (for example: list tables in a specific database, show a table schema, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). Once you provide the question I will:\n1) Explain my understanding of the question and the approach I'll take.\n2) Choose to either 'Operate' (in which case I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside an Action: Operation block) or 'Answer' (if no SQL is needed).\n3) After you execute the single SQL I provide and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and continue with another single SQL or produce the final answer.\n\nTo proceed, please state exactly what you want me to do and include database and table names if applicable. Example requests you can use or adapt:\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events where type = 'login'\"\n- \"Update mydb.settings set value = 'x' where name = 'y'\" (modifies data)\n\nWhen you provide the question I will prepare the single SQL statement to run.",
