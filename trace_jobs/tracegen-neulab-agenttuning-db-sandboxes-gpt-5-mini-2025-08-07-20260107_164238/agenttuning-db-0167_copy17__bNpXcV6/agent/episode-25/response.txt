  "analysis": "The container's mysqld_safe has just logged that mysqld was restarted. This suggests the server may be cycling or was recently restarted. Previously the server was running and responded to SHOW DATABASES;, but the recent restart message means I should re-check the current mysqld process, confirm the UNIX socket exists, inspect the recent MySQL error log for any problems during restart, and then attempt a quick connection (SHOW DATABASES;) to confirm the server is healthy. No application-specific question has been provided yet; this is a health-check to ensure the server is up-to-date and responding after the restart.",
  "plan": "1) List processes to confirm whether mysqld is running and note its PID. 2) List /var/run/mysqld to confirm the socket files exist. 3) Tail the last ~200 lines of the MySQL error log to see the restart sequence and any warnings/errors. 4) Attempt to connect to MySQL as root and run SHOW DATABASES; to confirm connectivity and list databases. Each command checks a different aspect of server health and connectivity.",
