The socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target to query. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered and include database and table names (and any filters or limits) if applicable. Once you provide a concrete request I will: 1) explain my understanding and the approach I'll take; 2) provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format: an Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block; you will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me; 3) analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations or produce the final answer (Action: Answer) when ready. Example requests you can give: \"List tables in database mydb\", \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\", \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\", or an UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE statement if you want to modify data.",
