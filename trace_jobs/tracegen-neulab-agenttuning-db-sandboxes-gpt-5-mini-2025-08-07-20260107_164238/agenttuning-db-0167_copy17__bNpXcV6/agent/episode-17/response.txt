The mysql client is available and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A previous test query returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a concrete question or target to query yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (include database and table names if applicable). After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the approach I'll take. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute. 3) When you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either produce another single SQL statement or give the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nExamples you can request (please include the exact database and table names when applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type='login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data)\n\nPlease specify the exact question you want answered now.",
