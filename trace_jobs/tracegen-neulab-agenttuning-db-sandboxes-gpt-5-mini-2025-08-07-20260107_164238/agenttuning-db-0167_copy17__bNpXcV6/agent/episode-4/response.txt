  "analysis": "MySQL server is now running in the container. I installed the mysql client and server, inspected the error log, started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe, and verified the server process and socket exist. A test query was executed successfully and returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases have been queried yet because you haven't asked a specific database question.",
  "plan": "You're expected to give a concrete question about the database contents or schema (for example: list rows from a table, count records meeting a condition, show table schema, or modify data). Once you provide the question I will:\n1) Explain my approach and reasoning here.\n2) Choose to either 'Operate' (produce a single SQL statement in the required format) or 'Answer' (if no further SQL is needed).\n3) If operating, I'll provide exactly one SQL statement in a one-line code block labeled as Action: Operation as you requested. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return its raw MySQL output to me. Then I'll analyze that output and continue iterating until we reach the final answer.\n\nIf you want me to run any further local shell checks before issuing SQL (for example: list databases, show tables in a specific database, inspect table schemas or data files), tell me which database or table to inspect. Otherwise, tell me the question you want answered about the database and I'll prepare the single SQL statement to run.",
