  "analysis": "The container now has a working MySQL server and client. I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe, and verified the server process and socket exist. A test query returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a concrete question about the database contents or schema.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, show a table's CREATE statement, select rows with a condition, count rows, or perform an update). Once you provide the question I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and the SQL I plan to run.\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside an Action: Operation SQL code block for you to execute. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. \n3) Analyze that output and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when ready.\n\nExamples you can request (please include database and table names when applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events where type='login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (this modifies data)\n\nTell me exactly which of the above (or another) you want, and I will prepare the single SQL statement to run.",
