  "analysis": "The mysql server package was installed but the server process is not running (ps shows no mysqld) and mysql client cannot connect because the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock is missing. The package installation logs indicated an attempt to start the server was blocked by policy-rc.d and earlier output mentioned \"mysqld is running as pid 1200\" even though it's not present in the current process list. /var/run/mysqld exists and is owned by mysql:mysql but contains no socket. To proceed I need to inspect the MySQL error log to learn why the server isn't running and then start mysqld manually (since init/systemd service start is blocked in this container environment). After starting the server I will confirm the process and socket exist and then run SHOW DATABASES; to list databases.",
  "plan": "1) Locate mysqld binary and check available server start helper scripts (mysqld, mysqld_safe) so I can start the server manually if needed. 2) Inspect MySQL error log (/var/log/mysql/error.log) for startup failure messages. 3) Attempt to start the server manually using mysqld_safe or mysqld as the mysql user (start in background). 4) Verify mysqld process is running and the socket file exists. 5) Connect with the mysql client and run SHOW DATABASES; to confirm database availability.\n\nI will run a short sequence of commands: check binary locations, view the error log, start mysqld manually, check process/socket, then run the SQL SHOW DATABASES; command.",
