  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and the server is running (started with mysqld_safe). A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected beyond that test. You have not yet provided a specific question or target (database/table/condition) for me to answer with SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly what you want to do with the MySQL instance. Please specify one concrete request (choose one):\n- List tables in a database (e.g., \"List tables in database mydb\")\n- Show CREATE TABLE for a table (e.g., \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\")\n- Select rows from a table (e.g., \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\")\n- Count rows matching a condition (e.g., \"Count rows in mydb.events where type='login'\")\n- Modify data (e.g., \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\")\n\nWhen you provide the exact question and database/table names, I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and approach. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (one-line SQL in markdown) for you to execute. 3) After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the result and continue until we reach the final answer.",
