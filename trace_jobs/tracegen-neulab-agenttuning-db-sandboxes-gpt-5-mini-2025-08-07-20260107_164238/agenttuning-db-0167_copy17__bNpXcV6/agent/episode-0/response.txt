  "analysis": "The shell is open as root in /app with no prior commands executed in this session. There is no visible MySQL output yet. To answer database questions I need to connect to the MySQL server and run SQL. Currently I don't know whether the mysql client is installed, whether the server is running, or which credentials (if any) are required. The next steps are to check for the mysql client, inspect whether a mysqld process or socket exists, and then attempt a simple connection to list databases. The outputs of those commands will determine further actions.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a mysql client binary to ensure we can run SQL from the shell. 2) Check for a running mysqld process and MySQL socket directory to see if the server is running locally. 3) Attempt to connect as root without a password to run a simple SQL statement (SHOW DATABASES;) so I can see what databases exist. Based on the response you provide after these commands, I will decide the next SQL operation. Each command is chosen to gather necessary environment information before making database changes or queries.",
