The MySQL socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no application-specific databases or tables inspected because you have not provided a concrete question or target to query. No further SQL has been executed since the test SHOW DATABASES;.",

Examples you can ask (include database and table names where applicable):\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type = 'login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (this modifies data)\n\nWhen you provide the specific question I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and the SQL I plan to run.\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You should execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) Analyze the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when ready.\n\nI am ready — please tell me the exact database question and include database/table names and any filters or conditions.",
