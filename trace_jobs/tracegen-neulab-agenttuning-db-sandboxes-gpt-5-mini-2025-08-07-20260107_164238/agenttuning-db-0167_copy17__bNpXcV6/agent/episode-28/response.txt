  "analysis": "The MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container (mysqld was started via mysqld_safe). The server process is active and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a concrete database question or target to query. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide a single, concrete database question or task including any database and table names and filters/limits (examples: \"List tables in database mydb\", \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id=10 LIMIT 10\", \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events WHERE type='login'\", or an UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE statement). Once you provide the exact request I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL I will run; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a one-line SQL in a SQL code block) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
