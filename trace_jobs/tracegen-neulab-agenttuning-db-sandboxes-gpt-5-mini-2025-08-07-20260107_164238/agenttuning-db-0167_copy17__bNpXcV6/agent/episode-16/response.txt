  "analysis": "The container now has a working MySQL server and client. I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started mysqld manually with mysqld_safe, and verified the server process and socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) exist. A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a concrete question or target to query.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want to do with the MySQL instance. Provide one concrete request (include database and table names if applicable). Examples you can choose or adapt:\n- \"List tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.users\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE id = 10 LIMIT 10\"\n- \"Count rows in mydb.events WHERE type = 'login'\"\n- \"UPDATE mydb.settings SET value='x' WHERE name='y'\" (modifies data)\n\nOnce you provide the specific question, I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL I plan to run, and (2) supply exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze the output and continue with further single-statement operations or produce the final answer when ready.",
