To run SQL statements from this shell I must first install a MySQL client. Even after installing a client, there may be no server running locally; attempting to connect will reveal that. I have not yet performed any SQL operations.",

I'll use the distribution's default MySQL client. 2) Verify the mysql client is available. 3) Attempt to connect to localhost as root and run SHOW DATABASES; to discover available databases (this will either list databases or produce an error if no server or credentials are available). Based on the result you return, I'll proceed with further SQL operations.",
