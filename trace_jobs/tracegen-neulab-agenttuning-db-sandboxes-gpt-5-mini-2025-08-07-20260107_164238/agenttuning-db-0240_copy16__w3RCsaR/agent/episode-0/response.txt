Nothing has been accomplished toward answering a database question because no question or DB access details were given.",
  "plan": "I will not run any shell commands yet because I don't have the user's question or any database connection details. To proceed I need you to provide: (1) the specific question you want answered (for example: \"Find the top 5 customers by revenue\"), (2) connection details for the MySQL server (host, port, username, password) or confirm that I should use the local socket, and (3) any helpful schema information (table names, relevant columns) if available. Once you provide that, I'll: \n- Connect to the MySQL server using the provided credentials with the mysql client. \n- Run exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted per your required pattern (I will output: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). \n- After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and decide the next SQL to run or produce the final answer. \n\nNotes about the SQL and interaction: every time I operate I will send exactly one SQL statement in the format you specified. When finished and certain of the result, I'll send: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...].",
