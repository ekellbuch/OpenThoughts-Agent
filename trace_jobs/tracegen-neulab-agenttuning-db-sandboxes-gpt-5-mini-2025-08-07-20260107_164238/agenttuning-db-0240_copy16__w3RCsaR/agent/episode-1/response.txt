  "analysis": "You are at a root bash prompt inside the container (root@b50f649a51ad:/app#). No commands have been run that pertain to MySQL, and there is no information about the database, schema, table names, or credentials in the terminal output. Nothing has been accomplished toward answering a database question because you haven't provided the question or any connection details. The environment appears ready for commands but currently idle.",
  "plan": "I need two things from you before I can operate on the MySQL database: (1) the specific question you want answered (for example: \"Which users have more than 1000 points?\" or \"List orders placed in January 2024\"), and (2) connection details for the MySQL server (host, port, username, password) or confirmation to use a local socket and the appropriate credentials. Optionally, schema hints (table names and relevant columns) speed things up but are not required.\n\nOnce you provide the question and connection info, I will proceed in iterative rounds. Each round I will do exactly one SQL operation. I will output that operation in the required format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze that output and either issue another single SQL statement or, when confident in the final answer, I will send:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlanned immediate steps (after you give connection details and the question):\n1) Connect using the mysql client: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p\n   - This opens the interactive client so we can run SQL. (I will not run this until you provide credentials or confirm local access.)\n2) Run a discovery query if schema unknown, e.g., SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; or DESCRIBE <table>; (each will be issued one at a time as you execute them and return output).\n3) Based on schema, run the precise SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE that answers the question. Each SQL will be a single statement in a single-line code block as required.\n\nIf you want, I can run some quick shell checks (ls, cat .my.cnf) to try to find credentials in the container — tell me if you permit that. Otherwise, please provide the question and DB connection info and I'll produce the first SQL statement to run.",
