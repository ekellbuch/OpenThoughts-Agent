  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). Previously there was no local MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) and no mysql client; we installed the client. We still do not know whether a MySQL server is running locally or remotely, nor do we have connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database). To run any SQL we will need connection details. It would also help to detect if a local mysqld process is running or if any socket files exist on the filesystem.",
  "plan": "1) Probe the container for any running mysqld process and for common MySQL socket locations (/run, /var/run, /tmp, /var/lib/mysql). This will tell us if a local server is available and how to connect (socket vs TCP). 2) After these probes, I will ask you to provide the question you want answered plus connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, and database). 3) Once you provide the connection info and the question, I will produce a single-line SQL statement in the exact required format to execute. The commands below perform the probes to discover a local server/socket/process.",
