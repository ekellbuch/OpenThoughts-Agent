  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I probed the container and found no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no mysql socket files). No SQL statements have been executed. Therefore I cannot query any database from this container until you provide connection details for a reachable MySQL instance (TCP host and port or unix socket) and credentials (username, password, and optionally a database), or until you instruct me to start/configure a local MySQL server here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the database question and connection details. Please supply:\n- The exact question (what you want returned or changed).\n- Connection details: either TCP host and port OR a unix socket path; plus username and password; and optionally the database name.\n\nAfter you provide those, I will produce a single operation response in the required format:\n- 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block (this will be the only SQL statement you should execute). I will also explain what the SQL does and what I expect the result to look like. When you run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and either request another operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nIf you prefer me to start a local MySQL server in this container, tell me and I will run the necessary commands (for example, apt-get install mysql-server and initialize/start it), but note this will require additional steps and possibly interaction for root password configuration. Alternatively, if the database is remote, provide host, port, user, password and database and I will craft the SQL for you to run.",
