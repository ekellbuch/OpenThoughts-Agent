  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no /var/run/mysqld socket files, and no discovered mysql socket. No SQL statements have been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection credentials or asked me to start a server here. The shell is idle at /app.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction on how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you want to be prompted), and optional database name.\n  - After you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either request another operation or produce the final answer with the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server here. Optionally provide a desired root password and any initial user/database names to create.\n  - If you confirm, I will run the necessary shell commands to install and start mysqld manually (systemd is not available in this environment), initialize a data directory if needed, create users/databases, and then run queries as requested.\n\nOption C — You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n  - Provide the exact question and I will give the one-line SQL statement you should run, or the exact mysql client invocation for this container (example below). After you paste the raw MySQL output back I will parse and continue.\n\nExample mysql client invocation (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n(omit the password after -p to be prompted rather than exposing it on the command line.)\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (the SQL question and connection credentials, or confirmation to install/start a local server). Once you do, I will produce the single-line SQL operation (or run installation/start commands if you confirm Option B).",
