  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I probed for a local server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no /var/run/mysqld socket files, and no mysql socket discovered. No SQL statements have been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection credentials or asked me to start a server here. The shell is idle at /app.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide any required details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted) OR unix socket path; username; password (or indicate you want to be prompted); and optional database name.\n  - After you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server here. Optionally provide desired root password and any initial user/database names to create.\n  - If you confirm, I will run the necessary shell commands to install and start mysqld manually (systemd is not available), initialize a data directory if needed, and create any requested users/databases. After the server is running and credentials are known, provide the question and I will produce the single-line SQL operation as above.\n\nOption C — You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n  - Provide the exact question and I will give the single-line SQL statement for you to run in your environment. When you paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to run the query from this container, include the credentials and I will also give the exact mysql client invocation I will use (e.g., mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nPlease reply with the option you choose and supply the required details (the exact question and connection credentials, or confirmation to install/start a local server).",
