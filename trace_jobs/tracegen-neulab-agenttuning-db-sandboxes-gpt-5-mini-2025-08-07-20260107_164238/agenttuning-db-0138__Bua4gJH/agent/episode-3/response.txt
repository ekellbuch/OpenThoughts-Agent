  "analysis": "You are in a minimal container. I installed the MySQL client successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I probed for a running MySQL server and common socket or data directories: no mysqld process found, /var/run/mysqld does not exist, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no mysql*.sock files were discovered. In short: there is no local MySQL server to connect to from this container. To run any SQL I need connection details for a reachable MySQL instance (either a TCP host:port or a Unix socket path) and credentials (username, password, and optionally a default database).",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you provide the question you want answered and the connection details. Please provide:\n- The SQL question (what you want returned or changed).\n- Connection details: host (or socket path), port (if TCP), username, password, and database name (if applicable).\n\nOnce you provide the connection details and the question, I will:\n1) Produce exactly one SQL statement in a single Markdown code block (one-line) as required by your instructions. That SQL will be the first SQL code block you execute. 2) Explain what the SQL does and what I expect the result to look like. 3) After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse the output and either produce another operation (if more queries are needed) or produce the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also provide the exact mysql client command to run locally here (for example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\") — but I will wait for your target MySQL connection info and the question before crafting the single-line SQL statement you must execute.",
