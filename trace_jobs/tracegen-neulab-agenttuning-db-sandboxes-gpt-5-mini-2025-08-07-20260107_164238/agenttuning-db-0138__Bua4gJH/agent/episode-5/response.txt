  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I searched for a local MySQL server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no mysql socket files. Therefore I cannot execute SQL against a database from this container until you provide connection details for a reachable MySQL instance (TCP host:port or Unix socket) and credentials (username, password, and optionally a default database). No SQL has been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the database question you want answered and the connection details. Please supply:\n- The exact question (what you want returned or changed).\n- Connection details: either host and port (for TCP) OR a unix socket path, plus username and password, and optionally the database name.\n\nOnce you provide those, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a one-line SQL code block). That will be the only SQL you should execute; after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and either request further operations or provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
