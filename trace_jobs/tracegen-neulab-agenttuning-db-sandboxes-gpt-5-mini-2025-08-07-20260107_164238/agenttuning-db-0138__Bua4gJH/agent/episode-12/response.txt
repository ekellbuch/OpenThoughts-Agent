  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I have checked for a local MySQL server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no mysql socket files. No SQL statements have been executed. Without a reachable MySQL instance and credentials I cannot run any SQL queries from this environment.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you tell me how to proceed. You can pick one of these options and provide the requested details:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL instance (recommended):\n - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (if not 3306), username, password (or say you want to be prompted), and optional database name.\n - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefix 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either request another operation or produce the final answer with the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n - If you want me to run the query from this container, supply the credentials and I will craft the mysql client invocation for this environment.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local MySQL server here:\n - Confirm you want me to install and start a local server. If yes, optionally provide desired root password, user, and database names.\n - I will run commands to install (apt-get install mysql-server), initialize a data directory if needed, and start mysqld manually (systemd may not be available in this environment). After the server is running I will create users/databases and then run queries as requested.\n\nIf you prefer to run queries yourself and paste results, here's an example mysql client command you can run from this container (replace placeholders):\n mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n(omit PASSWORD after -p to be prompted instead of exposing it on the command line.)\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the connection details and the exact question to answer. After that I will produce the single-line SQL operation in the exact required format.",
