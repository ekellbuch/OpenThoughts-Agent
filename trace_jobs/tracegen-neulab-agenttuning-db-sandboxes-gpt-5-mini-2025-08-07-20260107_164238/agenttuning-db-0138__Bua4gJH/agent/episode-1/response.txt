  "analysis": "You are in a minimal container at /app as root. There is no mysql client binary installed (mysql: command not found), no MySQL unix socket directory (/var/run/mysqld doesn't exist), no obvious MySQL-related environment variables, and common utilities like ss are not available. That means I cannot run SQL against a MySQL server from this environment yet. To proceed I need a MySQL client (or other means) to connect to a running MySQL server. It's also possible there is no MySQL server running on this container; if the database runs elsewhere I will need its host, port, username and password (or a socket path and credentials).",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client in the container so I can run SQL (use the distribution's package manager). 2) Verify the client is installed. 3) After the client exists, I will ask you for the connection details (host/port or socket, user, password) or any question about the database you want answered. Once you provide the connection details and the query question, I'll craft a single-line SQL statement and you will execute it and paste the result back. Commands to run now will attempt to install the client and verify it.",
