  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in this container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I checked for a local MySQL server and found none (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, no mysql socket). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided a question or connection credentials. The shell is idle at /app. To proceed I need either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL instance and the exact question you want answered, or (B) your confirmation to install and start a local MySQL server here (and any initial credentials/db names).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A (recommended) — Query an existing MySQL instance:\n - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT, COUNT, UPDATE, etc.).\n - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted) OR unix socket path; username; password (or say you want to be prompted); and optional database name.\n - Once you provide the question and credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). That will be the only SQL you should execute; paste the raw MySQL output back and I will parse it and continue (or finish with 'Action: Answer').\n - If you want me to run the query from this container, include the credentials and I will also show the exact mysql client invocation to run here (e.g. mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server. Optionally provide a desired root password and any initial user/database names to create.\n - If you confirm, I will run the necessary shell commands to install and start mysqld manually (systemd may not be available), initialize a data directory if needed, and create users/databases. After that, provide the question and I will produce the one-line SQL operation as above.\n\nOption C — You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n - Provide the exact question and (optionally) I will give the single-line SQL statement for you to run in your environment and the mysql client invocation to use. Paste the raw MySQL output back and I will parse it.\n\nHelpful examples:\n - mysql client invocation (TCP): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n - mysql client invocation (socket): mysql -S /path/to/mysql.sock -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (the exact question and connection credentials, or confirm to install/start a local server). After that I will provide the single-line SQL operation or run the install/start commands as you request.",
