I have not executed any SQL statements. To proceed I need a reachable MySQL instance and credentials or explicit instructions to start/configure a server here.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the database question and connection details. Please provide:\n- The exact question you want answered (what rows/aggregation/changes you need).\n- Connection details: either TCP host and port OR a Unix socket path; plus username and password; and optionally the default database name.\n\nIf you want me to connect from this container, give the TCP host:port, user, and password (and database). If you will run the SQL yourself and paste the raw MySQL output back to me, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). After you run it and return the raw output, I will parse it and either request another operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also provide the exact mysql client command to run from this container, for example:\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\nReplace HOST, PORT, USER, PASSWORD, DATABASE and <SQL> accordingly. (If you want to avoid exposing the password on the command line, omit it and mysql will prompt.)",
