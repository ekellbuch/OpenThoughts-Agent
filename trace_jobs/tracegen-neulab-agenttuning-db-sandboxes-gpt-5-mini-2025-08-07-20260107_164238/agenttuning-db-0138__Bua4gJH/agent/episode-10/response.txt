  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally in this container: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no unix socket files were found. I have not executed any SQL statements because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection credentials or the question to answer.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further commands until you tell me how to proceed. Choose one of the following and provide the requested details:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote/accessible MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (if not default 3306), username, password (or say you want to be prompted), and optional database name.\n  - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we can produce the final answer with the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - If you permit, I can install and initialize a local server (apt-get install mysql-server / initialize datadir / start mysqld manually). This may require additional steps and configuration (root password, creating a user/database). If you choose this, confirm and optionally provide desired root/user passwords and database names. I will then run the necessary shell commands and report back.\n\nIf you want to run queries yourself here and paste outputs, I can also provide the exact mysql client command to run from this container (for example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the connection details and the exact question to answer. After that I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format.",
