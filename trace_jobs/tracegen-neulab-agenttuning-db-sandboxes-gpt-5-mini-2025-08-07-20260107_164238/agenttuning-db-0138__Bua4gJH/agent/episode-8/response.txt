  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running in the container (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no socket files). No SQL statements have been executed in this session. Without a reachable MySQL server and credentials, I cannot run SQL or return query results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the database question and connection information. Please provide one of the following:\n\n1) Remote/accessible MySQL instance details (preferred):\n   - host (or IP) and port\n   - username and password\n   - database name (optional)\n\n   Once you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either request another operation or give the final 'Action: Answer'.\n\n2) If you want me to start a local MySQL server in this container, say so. I can install and initialize a server (e.g., apt-get install mysql-server) and start it, but that requires additional steps and may need you to accept defaults or provide a root password. If you choose this, I will run the necessary shell commands and report back.\n\nNotes/help:\n- Example mysql client command to run a query from this container (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n  (omit PASSWORD after -p to be prompted instead of exposing it on the command line)\n- When I provide an SQL operation, it will be exactly one statement in a single Markdown code block, one line only, per your instructions.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the connection details and the exact question you want answered. I will then produce the required single SQL operation.",
