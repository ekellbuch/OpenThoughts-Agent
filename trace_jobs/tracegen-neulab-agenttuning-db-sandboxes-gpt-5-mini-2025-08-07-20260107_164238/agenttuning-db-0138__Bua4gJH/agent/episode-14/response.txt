  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I checked for a local MySQL server and found none (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, no mysql socket files). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection credentials or asked me to start a server here. The shell is idle at /app.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you want to be prompted), and database name (if applicable).\n - After you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL (I will only use the first SQL code block you give me) and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse it and either request another operation or produce the final answer with 'Action: Answer'.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n - Confirm you want me to install and start a server locally. Optionally provide desired root password and any user/database names to create.\n - If you confirm, I will run the necessary shell commands to install/initialize and start mysqld (note: systemd may not be available; I will start mysqld manually). Then provide the question and I will issue SQL operations as above.\n\nOption C — You will run queries outside this container and paste outputs here:\n - Provide the exact question and, if you want, I will give the one-line SQL statement and the exact mysql client invocation for you to run locally.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to run the query from this container, provide the credentials and I will also give the exact mysql client command to run here (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and the required details (question and connection credentials, or confirmation to install/start a local server).",
