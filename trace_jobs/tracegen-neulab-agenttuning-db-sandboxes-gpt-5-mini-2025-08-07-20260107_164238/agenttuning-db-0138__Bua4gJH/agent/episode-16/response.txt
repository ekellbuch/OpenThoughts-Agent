  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I scanned for a local MySQL server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no /var/run/mysqld socket files. No SQL statements have been executed because there is no reachable MySQL instance and you have not provided connection credentials or asked me to start a server here. The shell is idle at /app.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one of the following and provide the requested details or confirmation:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you want to be prompted), and optional database name.\n  - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer (which I will output with the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern).\n\nOption 2 — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - If you confirm, I will install and initialize a server here. Please indicate any desired root password and any initial user/database names to create. Note: systemd is not available in this environment, so I will start mysqld manually after installation.\n  - After the server is running and credentials are known, provide the question and I will produce the single-line SQL operation as above.\n\nOption 3 — You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n  - Provide the exact question and, if desired, I will give the single-line SQL statement and the exact mysql client invocation to run locally (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection info and the exact question, or confirmation to install/start a local server). Once you do, I will produce the single SQL operation (or run the install/start commands if you confirm Option 2).",
