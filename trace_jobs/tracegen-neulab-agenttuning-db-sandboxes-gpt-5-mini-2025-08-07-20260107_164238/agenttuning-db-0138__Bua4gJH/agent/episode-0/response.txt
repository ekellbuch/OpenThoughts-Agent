  "analysis": "I am in a root shell at /app inside the container. No commands have been run yet in this session. The task description says you'll ask a MySQL question and I should help operate the database using SQL statements. Before running any SQL, I need to discover what MySQL client/binaries are available, whether a MySQL server is listening, and whether any credentials or socket path are available on the filesystem (for example /etc/mysql/debian.cnf often contains credentials in some images). Nothing has been inspected yet, so I will probe the environment to find the MySQL client, server socket/port, and any stored credentials so I can connect when you provide the question and ask me to run SQL.",
  "plan": "I'll run a short sequence of inspection commands to learn how to connect to the MySQL instance:\n- list files in the current directory to understand context\n- check whether the mysql client binary exists and its version\n- check network listeners for port 3306 to see if a MySQL server is reachable via TCP\n- check for the MySQL unix socket directory (/var/run/mysqld)\n- look for environment variables that might contain connection info (MYSQL_*)\n- if present, print /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which sometimes contains usable credentials for local root access\nEach command is quick (immediate) except the version/network checks which I allow a little more time for. After these probes, I'll report back and then we can run the actual SQL you ask for.",
