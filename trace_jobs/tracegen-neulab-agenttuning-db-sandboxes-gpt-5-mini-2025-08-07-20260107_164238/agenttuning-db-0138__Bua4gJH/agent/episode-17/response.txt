  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I verified there is no local MySQL server running: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket files. No SQL statements have been executed. I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either (A) provide connection details for a reachable MySQL instance (host/port or socket, username, password, optional database) or (B) explicitly allow me to install and start a local MySQL server in this container and provide any desired initial credentials. You have not provided the question to be answered yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and supply the required information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what SELECT/aggregation/UPDATE/etc.).\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted) OR a unix socket path; username and password; and an optional database name.\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' with a single-line SQL code block). That SQL will be the first SQL code block you execute; you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here for me to parse and continue.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server here. Optionally provide the desired root password and any initial user/database names to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run the shell commands to install, initialize, and start mysqld manually (systemd is not available), create users/databases as requested, and then you can provide the question to answer.\n\nIf you prefer to run queries yourself, I can give the exact mysql client invocation to run from this container once you supply connection details. Example usage (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n(Omit the password after -p to be prompted for it.)\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the required details (the exact question and connection credentials, or confirmation to install/start a local server).",
