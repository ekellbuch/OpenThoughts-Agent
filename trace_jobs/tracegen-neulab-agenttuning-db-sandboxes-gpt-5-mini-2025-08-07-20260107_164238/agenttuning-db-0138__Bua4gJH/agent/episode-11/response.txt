  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I probed for a local server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no /var/run/mysqld socket files. No SQL statements have been executed. At this point there is no reachable MySQL server from which I can run queries without additional connection details or without starting a local server here. You have not provided the database question nor any connection credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. You have two main options:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if unspecified), username, password (or indicate you want to be prompted), and the database name (if applicable).\n  - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single SQL code block. That SQL will be the only SQL you should execute; after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and either produce another operation or finish with the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - If you want me to install and initialize a local server here, confirm and optionally provide desired root password or user credentials and database names. Note: in this environment systemd is not available, so I would install mysql-server (apt-get install mysql-server) and start the server manually (mysqld) and then create users/databases as needed. This may require additional interactive steps; confirm you want me to proceed and give any required values.\n\nIf you prefer to run the SQL yourself from this container, tell me and I will craft the exact one-line mysql client command you should run here (for example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (the exact question and connection credentials, or permission to install/start a local server). After that I will provide the single-line SQL operation in the exact required format.",
