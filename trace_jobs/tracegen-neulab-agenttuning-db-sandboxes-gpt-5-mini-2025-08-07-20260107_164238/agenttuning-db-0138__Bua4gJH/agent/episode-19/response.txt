There is no MySQL server running locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket files were found. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection credentials or the question to answer. The shell is idle at /app.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details:\n    * host (or IP) or unix socket path\n    * port (if TCP; default 3306)\n    * username\n    * password (or say you want to be prompted)\n    * database name (optional)\n  - If you want me to run the query from this container, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format. If you prefer to run it yourself, I will provide the single-line mysql client command to run here.\n\nExample client invocation (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n(omit password after -p to be prompted; or use -S /path/to/socket for a unix socket.)\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install and start a local server here and optionally provide desired root password and any user/database names to create.\n  - If confirmed, I will run the necessary apt-get install and start mysqld manually, then create users/databases per your instructions. After that I can run the requested query.\n\nOption C — You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n  - Provide the exact question; I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run in your environment. When you paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue.\n\nWhen you respond, include the chosen option plus the exact question and any connection/credential details or confirmation to install a local server. Once I have that, I will produce the single SQL operation (or the install/start commands if you request Option B).",
