  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I verified there is no local MySQL server running: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no /var/run/mysqld socket files, and no discovered mysql socket. No SQL statements have been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided remote connection credentials or asked me to start a server locally. I'm currently idle at a bash prompt in /app.",
  "plan": "I will not take further action until you tell me how you want to proceed. There are three clear options; pick one and provide necessary details or confirmation:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what SELECT/aggregation/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if not given), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and optional database name.\n  - I will then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will run that single SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either produce another operation or finish with 'Action: Answer'.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container (I can do this for you):\n  - Confirm that you want me to install and initialize a local server. Optionally provide desired root password (or say to use an empty password) and any user/database names to create.\n  - If you confirm, I will run the commands to install mysql-server, initialize/start mysqld manually (systemd isn't available), secure or set passwords as requested, and create any requested user/database. After the server is running and credentials are known, provide the question and I will produce the one-line SQL operation as above.\n\nOption C — You will run queries outside this container and paste results here:\n  - If you prefer, tell me the SQL question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement for you to run in your environment (or provide the exact mysql client invocation to run from this container if you give connection details). After you paste raw MySQL output, I'll parse and continue.\n\nPlease choose one of the options and provide the required details. If you choose Option B (start local server), reply with confirmation and any passwords/usernames/databases to create. If you choose Option A or C, provide the connection info and the exact question you want answered. Once you do, I will generate the single SQL operation (or the shell commands to start the server) as required.",
