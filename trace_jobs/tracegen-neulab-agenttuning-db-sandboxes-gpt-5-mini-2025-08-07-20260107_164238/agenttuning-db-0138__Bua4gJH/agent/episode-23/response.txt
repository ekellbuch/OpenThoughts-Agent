  "analysis": "You are at a bash prompt in /app inside the container as root. The MySQL client was installed earlier (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I have checked for a local MySQL server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket files, and no mysql socket found. No SQL statements have been executed because there is no reachable MySQL instance and you have not supplied connection credentials or asked me to start a local server. The environment is idle waiting for direction.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of these actions and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\n1) Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n   - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n   - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306) OR unix socket path; username; password (or indicate you want to be prompted); and optional database name.\n   - After you provide those, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block. That will be the single SQL you should run; paste the raw MySQL output back here and I will parse it and continue or finish with the required \"Action: Answer\" pattern.\n\n2) Install and start a local MySQL server in this container:\n   - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server and, if desired, provide an initial root password and any user/database names to create.\n   - If confirmed, I will run the necessary shell commands to install and start mysqld manually (apt-get install mysql-server / initialize datadir / start mysqld) and then create the requested users/databases. After the server is running I will ask for the exact question and then provide the single SQL operation as above.\n\n3) You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n   - Provide the exact question and, optionally, I will supply the single-line SQL statement and an example mysql client invocation you can run in your environment (e.g. mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nIf you choose option 1 and want me to run the query from this container, include full credentials and the database name. If you choose option 2, confirm and provide any desired passwords/user/db names. If you choose option 3, provide the question and I will produce the SQL for you to run and paste results back.",
