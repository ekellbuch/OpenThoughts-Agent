There is no MySQL server running locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket files were found. No SQL statements have been executed. I cannot run queries until you either provide reachable MySQL connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database) or ask me to install and start a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and provide the necessary details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what SELECT/aggregation/UPDATE/etc.).\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you want to be prompted), and database name (optional).\n- I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until final 'Action: Answer'.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a server here and optionally supply desired root password, user, and database names.\n- I will run the install/start commands and create users/databases as requested, then run queries as you ask.\n\nOption C — You will run queries outside this container and paste outputs here:\n- Provide the question and I will give the one-line SQL statement you should run, or the full mysql client invocation for this container (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the required details (the SQL question and connection credentials, or confirmation to install/start a local server).",
