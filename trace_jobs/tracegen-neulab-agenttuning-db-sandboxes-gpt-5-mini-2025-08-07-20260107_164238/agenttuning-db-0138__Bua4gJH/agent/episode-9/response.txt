  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I probed the container and confirmed there is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no mysql socket files). No SQL statements have been executed. Without a reachable MySQL instance and credentials, I cannot run SQL or return query results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how you want to proceed. You have two main options:\n\nOption A — Query a remote/accessible MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port, username, password (or say you want to be prompted), and optional database name.\n  - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and then either request another operation or give the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Tell me you want me to install and start a local server here. I can run the necessary shell commands to install and initialize a server (for example apt-get install mysql-server or mariadb-server), initialize a data directory, and start the server process directly (mysqld). Note: this may require additional configuration and could prompt for passwords; in this environment systemd is not available, so I will start mysqld manually.\n  - After starting the server I will create a user/database if needed and then you can provide the question to run.\n\nIf you will run the query yourself locally (from this container), here is an example mysql client invocation you can use (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\"\n(If you include the password immediately after -p as -pPASSWORD it is exposed on the command line; omitting the password will make mysql prompt for it.)\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the required details (the question and connection credentials, or permission to install/start a local server). Once you do, I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the exact format you required.",
