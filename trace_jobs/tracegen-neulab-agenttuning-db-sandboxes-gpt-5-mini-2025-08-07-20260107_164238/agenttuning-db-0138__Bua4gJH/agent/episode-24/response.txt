  "analysis": "You are at a root bash prompt in /app inside the container. The MySQL client was installed successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I searched for a running MySQL server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no /var/run/mysqld socket files, and no mysql socket was discovered. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided any connection credentials or the question to answer. The environment is idle and ready for next instructions.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/COUNT/UPDATE/etc.).\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP) and port (default 3306 if omitted) OR a unix socket path; username; password (or say you want to be prompted); and optional database name.\n  - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with \"Action: Operation\" and containing a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL (it must be the first SQL code block you execute) and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either request another operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Reply confirming you want me to install and initialize a local server. Optionally provide a desired root password and any initial user/database names to create.\n  - If confirmed, I will run the necessary shell commands to install and start mysqld manually (systemd is not available) and then create users/databases as requested. After the server is running and credentials are known, provide the question and I will produce the single-line SQL operation as above.\n\nOption C — You will run queries elsewhere and paste outputs here:\n  - Provide the exact question and I will give the single-line SQL statement (and the mysql client invocation example) for you to run. Paste the raw MySQL output back and I will parse it.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to execute the query from this container, include full credentials and the database name and I will also provide the exact mysql client invocation I will use. If you choose Option B, confirm and provide any initial credentials/db names. After you reply with your choice and the necessary details, I will produce the single SQL operation (or run the install/start commands) as required.",
