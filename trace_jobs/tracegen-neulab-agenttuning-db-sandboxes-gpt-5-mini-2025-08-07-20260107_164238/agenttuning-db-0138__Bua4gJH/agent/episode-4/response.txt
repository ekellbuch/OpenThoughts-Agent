I probed the container and found no local MySQL server: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no mysql socket files. Therefore I cannot run SQL locally without a remote/accessible MySQL instance and credentials. You haven't yet provided the question you want answered nor any connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the database question and the connection details. Please provide:\n- The question you want answered (what result or modification you need).\n- Connection details: either TCP host and port OR unix socket path; plus username and password; and optionally a default database name.\n\nOnce you provide those, I will produce a single-line SQL statement in a Markdown code block (preceded by 'Action: Operation' as you required). I will also show the exact mysql client invocation you can run here (if you want me to run it via the client) or just the SQL to execute in your environment. After you run the SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse it and continue (either produce another SQL operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern).",
