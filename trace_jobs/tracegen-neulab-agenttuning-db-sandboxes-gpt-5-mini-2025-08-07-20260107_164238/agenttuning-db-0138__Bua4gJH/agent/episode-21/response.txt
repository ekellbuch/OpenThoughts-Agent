  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). I checked for a local server and found none: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket files. No SQL has been executed. I cannot run queries until I have either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL instance (host/port or socket, username, password, optional database) or (B) permission and parameters to install and start a local MySQL server in this container so I can create/inspect databases locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these two actions and provide the necessary details. After you reply I will run commands as follows based on your choice:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL instance (recommended):\n - You supply: host (or socket path), port (if TCP), username, password (or say prompt), and optional database name, plus the exact question to answer.\n - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL (it must be the first SQL block you run) and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and proceed or finish with 'Action: Answer'.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local MySQL server in this container:\n - Confirm you want me to proceed and, if you wish, give initial passwords/user/database names (or say use defaults/unset password).\n - I will run apt-get install mysql-server and then start mysqld manually (since systemd is not available), initialize the data directory if needed, and create any requested user/database. After the server is running I will ask for the exact question and then produce the single-line SQL operation as above.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (for Option A: connection info + the SQL question; for Option B: confirmation and any passwords/user/database names). If you choose Option A and want me to run the query from this container, include credentials and I will also provide the precise mysql client invocation I will use.",
