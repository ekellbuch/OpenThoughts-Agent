  "analysis": "The mysql client is now installed (mysql 8.0.44). A direct socket connection failed: ERROR 2002 Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2). That indicates there is no mysqld running in this container listening on the default UNIX socket. To proceed I must either find a remote MySQL server to connect to (via environment variables or host address/port) or start a local MySQL server (which may not be appropriate in this environment). Right now no server has been contacted and no SQL has been executed successfully.",
  "plan": "1) Look for environment variables that might contain MySQL connection info (host, port, user, password) so we can connect remotely. 2) Check whether the socket directory exists and list it. 3) Inspect /etc/hosts to see any service hostnames. 4) Try a TCP connection to localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 3306 to confirm whether a MySQL server is listening on TCP. Based on the results I will either request connection details or proceed to run SQL. Expected results: printenv greps may reveal variables like MYSQL_HOST, DB_HOST, MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR; ls of /var/run/mysqld will show whether socket exists; mysql -h127.0.0.1 will attempt a TCP connection and show either databases or a connection refused/error.",
