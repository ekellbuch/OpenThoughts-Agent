When you provide the question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify the relevant tables/columns; (2) Describe the single SQL statement I will run and why it answers the question; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, if done, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
