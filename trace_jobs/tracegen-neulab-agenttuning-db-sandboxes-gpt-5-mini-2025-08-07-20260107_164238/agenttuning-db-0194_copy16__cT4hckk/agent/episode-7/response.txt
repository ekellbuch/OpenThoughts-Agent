I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and successfully connected as root (no password) to run SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The environment is ready to accept further SQL commands. No new operations have been executed since the last check.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide a question, I will: (1) Explain what data is needed and how I'll query it; (2) Present exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) that I ask you to execute; (3) After you run that SQL and supply the output, I'll analyze the results and either request another operation or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. For now I will not run any commands until you give the database query or instruct me to operate.",
