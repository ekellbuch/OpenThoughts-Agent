I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started mysqld, and verified connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No further SQL operations have been executed. The environment is ready to accept SQL commands against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Await your database question. When you provide a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify which tables/columns are relevant. (2) Explain the single SQL statement I will run and why it answers the question. (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
