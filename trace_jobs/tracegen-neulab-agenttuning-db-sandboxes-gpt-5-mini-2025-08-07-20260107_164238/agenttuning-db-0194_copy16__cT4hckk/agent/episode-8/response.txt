I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No further SQL has been executed since that check. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide the question, I will: (1) Restate/clarify what you want to find and which tables/columns are relevant; (2) Propose a single SQL statement that answers the question and explain why it will work; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the output, I'll analyze the results and either request another operation or, when finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
