I verified mysql client version (8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root without a password produced the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No additional SQL queries have been executed since then. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want to find and which tables/columns are relevant. (2) Explain the single SQL statement I will run and why it answers the question. (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the results and either request another operation or, when finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
