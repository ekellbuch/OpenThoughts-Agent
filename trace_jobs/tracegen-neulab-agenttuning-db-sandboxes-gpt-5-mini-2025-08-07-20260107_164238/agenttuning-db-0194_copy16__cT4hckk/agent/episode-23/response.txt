I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started mysqld, and verified connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or further SQL queries have been executed. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server as root (no password).",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you provide it I will: (1) restate and analyze what data is required and which database/table/columns are relevant; (2) explain the single SQL statement I propose to run and why it answers the question; (3) if you instruct me to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. If you want me to first inspect available databases or tables, tell me which inspection query you want (e.g., list databases, use a database and show tables, or query a specific table).",
