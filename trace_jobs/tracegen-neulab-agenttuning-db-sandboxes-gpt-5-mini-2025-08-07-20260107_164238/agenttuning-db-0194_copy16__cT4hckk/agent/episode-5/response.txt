When you ask a question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and the SQL I plan to run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will provide a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). That SQL will be executed (I will include the corresponding shell command to run it). After you provide the SQL output, I will analyze it and either run another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
