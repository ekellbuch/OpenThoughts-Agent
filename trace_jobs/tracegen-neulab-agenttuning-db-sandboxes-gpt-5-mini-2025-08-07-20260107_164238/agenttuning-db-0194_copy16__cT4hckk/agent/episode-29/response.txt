Tell me one of the following (or give a custom request):\n- \"operate: list databases\" (runs SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"operate: show tables from <dbname>\" (runs SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;)\n- \"operate: show create table <dbname>.<table>\" (runs SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;)\n- \"operate: select sample from <dbname>.<table>\" (runs SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;)\n- \"operate: count rows in <dbname>.<table>\" (runs SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;)\nOr provide a custom question (e.g., find rows matching a condition). Once you tell me which operation to perform, I will: (1) restate the question, (2) explain the single SQL statement I'll run, and (3) output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL in a markdown code block).",
