I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The shell is idle and no further SQL queries have been executed. No environment variables or external MySQL hosts were found earlier. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify which database/tables/columns are relevant; (2) Explain the single SQL statement I propose to run and why it answers the question; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
