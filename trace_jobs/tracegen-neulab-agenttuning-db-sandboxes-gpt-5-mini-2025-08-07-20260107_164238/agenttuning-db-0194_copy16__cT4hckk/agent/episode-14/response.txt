I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root without a password previously returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The container prompt is idle and no further SQL operations have been executed. The environment is ready to accept SQL commands against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide the question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want to find and identify relevant tables/columns; (2) Explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and why it answers the question; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
