I verified connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; as root (no password) which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases or additional SQL queries have been run since then. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Await your database question. When you provide the question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify the relevant tables/columns to query. (2) Explain the single SQL statement I propose to run and why it answers the question. (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the results and either request another operation or, when finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
