  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in the container. A local MySQL server (mysqld) and the mysql client are installed and running. I verified ability to connect as root (no password) and ran SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No further SQL queries have been executed. There are no MySQL-related environment variables pointing to a remote host. The environment is ready for interactive SQL operations.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question or instruction. If you want me to operate now, tell me which single action to perform. Options I can run (each would be delivered as exactly one SQL statement when you ask me to operate):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- Show tables in a database: USE dbname; SHOW TABLES; (note: this is two statements — I can run SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; as one statement instead)\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table_name;\n- Select sample rows: SELECT * FROM dbname.table_name LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table_name;\n- Find specific rows by condition: SELECT * FROM dbname.table_name WHERE condition LIMIT 100;\nTell me which of the above (or provide a custom question). When you instruct me to operate I will: (1) restate the question, (2) explain the SQL I'll run, and (3) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either request another operation or provide the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
