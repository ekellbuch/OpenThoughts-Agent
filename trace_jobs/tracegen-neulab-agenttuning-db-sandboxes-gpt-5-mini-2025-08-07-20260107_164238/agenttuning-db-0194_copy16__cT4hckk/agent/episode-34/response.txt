  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server (mysqld) and the mysql client (v8.0.44). I previously started the server and confirmed I can connect as root (no password) — SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or tables have been inspected since. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations, but you have not provided a specific database question or instructed me to run a SQL statement.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question or for you to choose one inspection operation. When you ask me to operate I will: (1) restate and analyze the question and the data needed; (2) explain the single SQL statement I will run and why it answers the question; (3) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). Example inspection operations you can request now (tell me e.g. \"operate: list databases\"):\n- list databases -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- show tables from <dbname> -> SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n- show create table <dbname>.<table> -> SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;\n- select sample from <dbname>.<table> -> SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- count rows in <dbname>.<table> -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;\n\nReply with the single operation you want (or a custom question). I will then produce the one-line SQL statement in the exact Action: Operation format you required.",
