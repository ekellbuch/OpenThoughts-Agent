I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No further SQL queries have been executed. The environment is idle and ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify relevant tables/columns. (2) Explain the single SQL statement I will run and why it answers the question. (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze results and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
