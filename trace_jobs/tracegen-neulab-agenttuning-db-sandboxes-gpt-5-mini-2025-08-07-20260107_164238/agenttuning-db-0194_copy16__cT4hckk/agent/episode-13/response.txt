I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started the mysqld service, and verified I can connect as root (no password) — SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No further SQL queries have been made. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify which tables/columns are relevant. (2) Propose the single SQL statement to run and explain why it will answer the question. (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze the result and either ask for another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
