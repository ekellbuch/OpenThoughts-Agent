I verified mysql client v8.0.44 and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL commands against the local MySQL server. No further action has been taken because you have not provided a specific database question or instructed me to operate.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to give a specific database question or tell me which inspection step to perform. When you instruct me to operate I will: 1) Restate and analyze the question and explain which tables/columns are relevant. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) that I ask you to execute. 3) After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or give the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nCommon first inspection actions you can ask me to run (I will provide the single SQL statement when you say 'operate'):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;  (replace dbname)\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table_name;  (replace dbname.table_name)\n- Show sample rows: SELECT * FROM dbname.table_name LIMIT 10;  (replace dbname.table_name)\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table_name;  (replace dbname.table_name)\n\nTell me which operation you want (or provide your question). If you want me to start by listing databases, say 'operate: list databases' and I will produce the required single SQL statement.",
