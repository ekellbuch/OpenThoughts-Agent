I need to determine whether the MySQL client is available and whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running and accessible. Once I confirm access I will run SQL queries as you request. Right now nothing has been accomplished toward querying the database.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary exists and its version. 2) Check whether a mysqld server process is running. 3) Inspect common MySQL data and config directories to see if a server is present and where the socket might be. 4) If the server appears accessible, attempt a simple SQL command to list databases. Each step will help determine how to proceed with specific SQL operations.",
