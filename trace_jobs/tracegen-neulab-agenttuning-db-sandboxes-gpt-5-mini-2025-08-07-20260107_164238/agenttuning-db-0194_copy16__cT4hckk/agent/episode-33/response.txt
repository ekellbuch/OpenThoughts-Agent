  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server (mysqld) and the mysql client (v8.0.44). I verified I can connect as root (no password) and earlier ran SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected. The environment is idle and ready to accept SQL operations, but you have not provided a specific database question or chosen an operation to run.",
  "plan": "I'll wait for you to specify exactly one operation to perform. When you tell me to operate I will: (1) restate and analyze the question, (2) explain the SQL I will run, and (3) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). Possible immediate inspection operations you can ask for (I will produce the single SQL for the one you choose):\n- list databases -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- show tables from <dbname> -> SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n- show create table <dbname>.<table> -> SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;\n- select sample from <dbname>.<table> -> SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- count rows in <dbname>.<table> -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;\n\nPlease reply with one of these commands (examples):\n- \"operate: list databases\"\n- \"operate: show tables from mydb\"\n- \"operate: show create table mydb.users\"\n- \"operate: select sample from mydb.orders\"\n- Or give a custom question (e.g., \"operate: find users with email like '%@example.com' in mydb.users\").\n\nAfter you pick an operation I will provide the single SQL statement in the exact Action: Operation format you required.",
