  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client binary installed (mysql: command not found) and there is no local mysqld process visible. I cannot yet run SQL against any server from this environment. To proceed I need a MySQL/MariaDB client installed so I can attempt to connect to a server (likely localhost/socket). The next step is to install a client package and then try a simple SQL command to list databases (SHOW DATABASES).",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists. 2) Install a MySQL/MariaDB client package (install both default-mysql-client and mariadb-client to maximize chance of availability). 3) Attempt to connect as root without password and run SHOW DATABASES to see accessible databases/sockets. If that succeeds we'll inspect results and continue with SQL operations per your instructions.",
