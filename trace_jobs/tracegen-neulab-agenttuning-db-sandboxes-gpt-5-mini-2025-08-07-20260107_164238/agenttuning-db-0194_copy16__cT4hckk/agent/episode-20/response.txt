I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started mysqld, and verified connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; as root (no password) which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No further SQL queries have been executed. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide the question I will (1) restate and analyze what data is needed and which tables/columns are relevant; (2) propose the single SQL statement to run and explain why it answers the question; (3) if you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
