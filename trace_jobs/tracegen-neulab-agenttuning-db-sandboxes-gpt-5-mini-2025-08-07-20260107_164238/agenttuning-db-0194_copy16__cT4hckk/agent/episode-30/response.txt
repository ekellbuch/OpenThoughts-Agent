  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify a single SQL operation to run. When you tell me to operate I will: (1) restate the question, (2) explain the single SQL statement I will run and why, and (3) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by one-line SQL in a markdown code block). To proceed, tell me one of the following (use one of these exact phrasings or a custom request):\n- \"operate: list databases\"  (will run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"operate: show tables from <dbname>\"  (will run: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;)\n- \"operate: show create table <dbname>.<table>\"  (will run: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;)\n- \"operate: select sample from <dbname>.<table>\"  (will run: SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;)\n- \"operate: count rows in <dbname>.<table>\"  (will run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;)\nOr provide a custom question (e.g., find rows matching a condition) and I will produce the single SQL statement to run. If you want me to start with a simple inspection, say: \"operate: list databases\".",
