When you ask me to operate I will: (1) restate and analyze the question and identify which database/table/columns are relevant; (2) explain the single SQL statement I will run and why it answers the question; (3) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<one-line SQL statement>\n```\n\nAfter you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or produce the final answer using the exact pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nIf you want me to start with an inspection, choose one of these and say \"operate\":\n- list databases (runs: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- show tables from <dbname> (runs: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;)\n- show create table <dbname>.<table> (runs: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;)\n- select sample from <dbname>.<table> (runs: SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;)\n- count rows in <dbname>.<table> (runs: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;)\n\nTell me which operation to perform and I will produce the single SQL statement in the exact required format.",
