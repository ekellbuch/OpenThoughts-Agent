Attempts to connect via socket and TCP to localhost failed (no /var/run/mysqld socket, connection refused on 127.0.0.1:3306). To run SQL I must start or install a MySQL server in this environment (or be given remote connection details). Currently nothing has been changed on the DB because no server was available.",
  "plan": "Install and start a local MySQL server so I can run SQL against it. Steps:\n1) Install the default MySQL server package (default-mysql-server). This will install mysql-server and initialize files. 2) Start the MySQL service (using the service wrapper). 3) Verify mysqld is running. 4) Run a simple SQL statement SHOW DATABASES; to confirm a working server and reveal available databases. If root access is socket-based, connecting as root without password should work after the server starts.",
