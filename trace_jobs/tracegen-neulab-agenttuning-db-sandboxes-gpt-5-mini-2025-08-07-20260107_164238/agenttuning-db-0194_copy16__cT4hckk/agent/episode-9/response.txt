I verified mysql (client v8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No further SQL has been executed since that check. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide the question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify which tables/columns are relevant; (2) Explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and why it answers the question; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and supply the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, deliver the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
