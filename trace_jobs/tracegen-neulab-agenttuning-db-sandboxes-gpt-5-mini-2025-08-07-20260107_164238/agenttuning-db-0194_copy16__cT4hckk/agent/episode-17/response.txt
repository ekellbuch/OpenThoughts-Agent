I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, started mysqld, and verified connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The shell is idle at a prompt and no further SQL queries have been executed. The environment is ready to accept SQL commands against the local MySQL server as root (no password).",
  "plan": "I'll wait for your database question. When you ask a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and which tables/columns are relevant; (2) Describe the single SQL statement I plan to run and why it answers the question; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either request another operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
