I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The environment is idle and ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server. No further SQL queries have been executed since that verification.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide the question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify which tables/columns are relevant. (2) Explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and why it answers the question. (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
