  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root without a password previously returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No new SQL has been executed since that check. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question or instruction. When you provide a question I will: (1) Restate and analyze what you want and identify which tables/columns are relevant; (2) Explain the single SQL statement I propose to run and why it answers the question; (3) If you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
