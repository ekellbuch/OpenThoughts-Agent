A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question or instruction. Tell me which single operation you want me to run (I will then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format). Common first inspection options you can request now:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;  (replace dbname)\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table_name;  (replace dbname.table_name)\n- Show sample rows: SELECT * FROM dbname.table_name LIMIT 10;  (replace dbname.table_name)\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table_name;  (replace dbname.table_name)\n\nReply with which operation to perform (for example: \"operate: list databases\" or \"operate: show tables from mydb\"). When you tell me to operate I'll (1) restate the question, (2) explain the SQL I will run, and (3) provide the single SQL statement in the exact Action: Operation format you specified.",
