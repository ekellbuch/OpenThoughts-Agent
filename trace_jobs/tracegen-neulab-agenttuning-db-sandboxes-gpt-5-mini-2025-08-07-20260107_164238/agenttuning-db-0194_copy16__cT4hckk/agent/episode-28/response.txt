Tell me which single SQL operation you'd like me to prepare and execute (I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format when you ask me to operate). Example requests you can send: \n- \"operate: list databases\" (will run SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"operate: show tables from mydb\" (will run SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;)\n- \"operate: describe table mydb.table_name\" (will run SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.table_name; or SELECT * FROM mydb.table_name LIMIT 10; if you prefer data)\n- \"operate: select sample from mydb.table_name\" (will run SELECT * FROM mydb.table_name LIMIT 10;)\n- Or give a custom question like: \"Find users with email ending in @example.com in database mydb\" and I will propose the single SQL to run.\nWhen you choose an operation, I will: 1) restate the question, 2) explain the SQL to be run, and 3) output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL inside a markdown code block).",
