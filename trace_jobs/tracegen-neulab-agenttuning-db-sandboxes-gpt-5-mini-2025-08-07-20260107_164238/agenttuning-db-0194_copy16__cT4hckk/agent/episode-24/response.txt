  "analysis": "You are at a root shell inside the container. The MySQL client and server are installed and running. I verified the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) and started mysqld; connecting as root (no password) returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No further SQL queries have been executed. There are currently no environment variables or external MySQL hosts configured. The container is ready to accept SQL operations against the local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you ask a question I will: (1) restate and analyze what you want and identify which database/tables/columns are relevant; (2) explain the exact single SQL statement I plan to run and why it answers the question; (3) if you instruct me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. If you'd like, I can start by running one of these inspection queries (tell me which one to run):\n- List databases (SHOW DATABASES;)\n- Use a database and show its tables (USE dbname; SHOW TABLES; — note: two statements, would need to run one at a time)\n- Show table schema for a table (SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table_name;)\n- Select sample rows (SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;)\n- Count rows in a table (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;)\nTell me which operation to perform and I will provide the required single SQL statement in the precise format you specified.",
