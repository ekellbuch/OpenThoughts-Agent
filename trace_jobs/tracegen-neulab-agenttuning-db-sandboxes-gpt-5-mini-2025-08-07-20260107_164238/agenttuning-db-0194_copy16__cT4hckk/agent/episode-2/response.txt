  "analysis": "Previous attempt to install both default-mysql-client and mariadb-client failed due to package conflicts (mariadb-client unmet dependencies and conflicts with mysql client). No mysql client is currently available, and no local mysqld process was found earlier. To run SQL I need a client binary. Installing only the default MySQL client should avoid the mariadb conflicts and provide the mysql CLI to connect and run SHOW DATABASES.",
  "plan": "1) Install only the default-mysql-client package to get the mysql CLI (avoid installing mariadb-client to prevent conflicts). 2) Verify the mysql client is present with mysql --version. 3) Attempt to run a simple SQL statement: SHOW DATABASES; to see available databases/sockets. If the client is installed, we'll get output to proceed with further SQL operations.",
