We need to determine whether the MySQL client is available and then connect to the database to list databases/tables or run the SQL you will request. Nothing has been accomplished so far.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary is available (which mysql). 2) Check the mysql client version to confirm connectivity tools. 3) Attempt a connection as root and list databases (SHOW DATABASES;) so we can see what databases exist and proceed. If the client is missing or the root connection fails, we'll report that and propose next steps (install client or provide credentials).",
