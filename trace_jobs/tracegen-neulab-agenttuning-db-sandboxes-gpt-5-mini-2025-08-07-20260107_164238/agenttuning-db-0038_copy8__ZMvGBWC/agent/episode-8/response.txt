No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't supplied a question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to run SQL over the local server via the mysql client (socket connection works).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the question you want answered or the schema/data you want inspected/modified. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my approach and what tables/columns I expect to use. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute. 3) After you run it and provide the output, I will analyze the result and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the specified 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you prefer I can start by exploring the schema (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; USE <db>; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE <table>) — tell me which database to inspect or allow me to begin with 'mysql'.",
