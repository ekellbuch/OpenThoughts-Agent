  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and the server is running in the container. A previous query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases/tables/rows have been inspected beyond that. The environment is ready to execute SQL via the local mysql client (socket connection works as root). I am idle and waiting for your instruction about what to query or modify.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify what you want. Please tell me one of the following: (A) a specific question to answer (e.g., \"How many rows in table X where condition Y?\" — include the database/table if known), (B) that you want me to explore the schema (I can start with SHOW DATABASES; or a specific database's SHOW TABLES;), or (C) a modification to perform (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE with details). After you provide that, I will (1) explain the approach I'll take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required single-line SQL code block format) for you to execute. You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue with the next single SQL statement or give the final answer when complete.",
