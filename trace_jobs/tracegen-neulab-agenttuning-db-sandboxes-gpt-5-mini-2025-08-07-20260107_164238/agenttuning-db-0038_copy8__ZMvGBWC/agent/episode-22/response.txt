  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A previous command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. The environment is ready to accept SQL commands as root via the local unix socket. There is currently no specific question or SQL task provided by you.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or the schema exploration action you want me to perform. Options:\n- Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"How many rows in users where active=1?\"), and if known, provide the database/table name.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (e.g., list databases, show tables in a database, describe a table). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide exact details.\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the approach I'll take and then (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
