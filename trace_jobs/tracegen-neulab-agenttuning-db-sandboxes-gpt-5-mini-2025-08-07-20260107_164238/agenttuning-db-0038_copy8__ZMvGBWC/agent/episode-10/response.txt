No user-specific database, table, or query has been inspected because you haven't provided a question or requested schema exploration yet. The environment is ready to execute SQL via the local mysql client.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question you want answered from the database or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options:\n- Provide a specific question (for example: \"How many rows in users where active=1?\") and, if applicable, the target database/table.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a given database, or DESCRIBE a table). If you request exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\nOnce you specify, I will: (1) explain the approach I will take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (as required) for you to execute. After you run it and return the output, I will analyze it and either request/produce the next single SQL statement or provide the final answer.",
