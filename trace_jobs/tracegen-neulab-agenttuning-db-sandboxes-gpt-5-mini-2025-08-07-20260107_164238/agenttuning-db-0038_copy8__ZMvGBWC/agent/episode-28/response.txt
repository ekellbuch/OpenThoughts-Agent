A previous test command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested schema exploration or modification. The environment is ready to execute SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want done with the database. Choose one of the options below and provide any necessary details (database/table names, conditions, or desired modifications):\n- Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"Count rows in users where active=1\"), and if possible provide the database and table name.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (e.g., list databases, show tables in a database, describe a table). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nWhen you reply I will: (1) explain the approach I'll take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You should run only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue with the next single SQL statement or produce the final answer (Action: Answer) when complete.",
