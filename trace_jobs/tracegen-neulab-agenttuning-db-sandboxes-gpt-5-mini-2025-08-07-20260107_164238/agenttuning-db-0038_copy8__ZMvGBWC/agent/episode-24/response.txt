A prior command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. The environment is ready to execute SQL as root over the local unix socket, but you have not provided a specific question or requested schema exploration or modification yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Please specify one clear instruction from these options: (A) Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"How many rows in table users where active=1?\" — include database/table if known), (B) Ask me to explore the schema (e.g., list databases, show tables for a given database, describe a table), or (C) Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) with exact details. Once you choose, I will explain the approach and provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will then analyze it and continue or produce the final answer.",
