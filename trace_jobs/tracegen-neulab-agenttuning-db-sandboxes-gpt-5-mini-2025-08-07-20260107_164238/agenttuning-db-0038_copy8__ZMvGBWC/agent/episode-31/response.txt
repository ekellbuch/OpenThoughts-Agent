  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A prior command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. I have not executed any user-directed SQL because you have not provided a question or requested schema exploration/modification. The environment is ready to run SQL as root over the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want me to do with the database. Choose one of these options and provide any necessary details:\n- Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"Count rows in table users where active=1?\") and, if known, provide the database and table name.\n- Ask me to explore the schema. Common exploratory steps I can perform (one SQL statement at a time) are: SHOW DATABASES; USE <database>; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE <table>; SELECT ... to inspect rows. If you want exploration, tell me which database to start with or allow me to begin with the 'mysql' database.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the approach I will take for that request and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
