A previous test (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected because you have not yet provided a question or requested schema exploration. The environment is ready to run SQL over the local server via the mysql client.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the question you want answered or what you want inspected/modified in the database. Options you can request:\n- Explore schema: list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table (I will run one SQL statement at a time).\n- Query data: specify the target database/table and the query/condition you want.\n- Modify data: specify the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want performed and the target table/data.\nAfter you state the question or choose an exploration step, I will: (1) explain my approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You will run that statement and return the output; I will analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
