A previous command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No additional databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't provided a specific question or asked to explore the schema. The environment is ready to execute SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want me to do with the database. Please either: (A) provide the specific question you want answered (for example: \"How many rows in users where active=1?\"), optionally with the target database/table, or (B) ask me to explore the schema (for example: list databases, show tables in a database, describe a table). Once you specify, I will explain the approach I will take and then provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required Action: Operation / single-line SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and continue with the next single SQL statement or give the final answer.",
