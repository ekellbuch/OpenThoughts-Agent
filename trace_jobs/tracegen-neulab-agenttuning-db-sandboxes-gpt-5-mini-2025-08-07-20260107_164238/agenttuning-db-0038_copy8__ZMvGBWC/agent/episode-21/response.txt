  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A previous test (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. I'm connected as root via the local unix socket and ready to run SQL, but you have not yet provided the question or told me which schema/data to inspect or modify.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or to ask me to explore the schema. Options you can request now:\n- Provide a specific question (e.g., \"Count rows in table X where condition Y\"), and if known provide the database/table name.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; then USE <db>; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE <table>) — I'll run one SQL statement at a time per your rules.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) with exact details.\nWhen you specify, I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
