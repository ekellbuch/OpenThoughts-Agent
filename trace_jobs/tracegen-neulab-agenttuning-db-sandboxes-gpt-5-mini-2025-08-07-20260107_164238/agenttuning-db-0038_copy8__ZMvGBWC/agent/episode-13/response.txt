A prior command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet provided a database question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact question you want answered from the database or to request schema exploration. Options you can choose now:\n- Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"How many users in users table where active=1?\"), and provide the target database/table if known.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table). If you want exploration, tell me which database to inspect or allow me to start with 'mysql'.\n- Ask for a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), and provide the exact desired change.\nAfter you provide the question or choice, I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer (Action: Answer).",
