A test command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user data or schema has been explored yet because you haven't asked a specific question or requested any schema inspection. I'm currently idle and waiting for your instruction about what you want to find or modify in the database.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the question you want answered from the database (for example: list databases, list tables in a specific database, show rows matching some condition, aggregate data, or perform updates). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain how I'll approach it and what tables/columns I expect to use. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement in the required markdown format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. 3) After you run that statement and provide the output, I'll analyze the result and either provide another single SQL statement to continue exploration or produce the final answer (Action: Answer with Final Answer array) if we've reached the conclusion. If you want me to explore the schema first, say so and optionally indicate which database to inspect (otherwise I'll start with the default 'mysql' database).",
