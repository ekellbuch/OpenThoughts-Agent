  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A prior command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a question or asked me to explore the schema further. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options:\n- Provide a specific data question (e.g., \"How many rows in users where active=1?\") and, if known, the database/table names.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can list databases, show tables in a given database, or describe a table). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide exact details.\nAfter you specify, I will (1) explain the approach I will take, and then (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (formatted as required) for you to execute. You will run only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze that output and continue with further single-statement operations or give the final answer when complete.",
