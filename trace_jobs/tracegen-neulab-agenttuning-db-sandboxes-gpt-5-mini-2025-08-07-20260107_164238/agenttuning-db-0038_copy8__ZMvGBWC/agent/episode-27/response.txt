  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A prior test (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as root via the local unix socket. You have not yet provided a specific database question or asked me to explore the schema.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Choose one of these options and supply any needed details:\n- Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"How many rows in table users where active=1?\") and, if known, the database and table name.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a specified database; or DESCRIBE <table>). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nWhen you reply I will: (1) explain my approach for that request, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run only that SQL block and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue with further single-statement operations or produce the final answer.",
