  "analysis": "The container currently lacks the mysql client: attempts to run 'mysql' returned 'command not found'. There's no evidence of a MySQL server connection yet. To run SQL statements we need a client. It's possible a MySQL server is not running in this container or is on another host; after installing the client we will try to connect as root and list databases to discover available databases and whether credentials or a host are required.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) so we can run SQL from the shell. 3) Verify the client is available and its version. 4) Attempt to connect using 'mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"' to list databases. If connection fails, we'll inspect error output and adjust (e.g., supply host, socket, or credentials).",
