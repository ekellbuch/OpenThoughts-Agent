  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. A prior test (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") showed only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't given a specific question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options you can choose now:\n- Ask a specific data question (for example: \"How many rows in table users where active=1?\") and, if possible, provide the database and table names.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (for example: list databases, show tables in a particular database, or describe a specific table). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nWhen you specify the task, I will (1) explain the approach I will take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue with the next single SQL statement or provide the final answer (Action: Answer) when complete.",
