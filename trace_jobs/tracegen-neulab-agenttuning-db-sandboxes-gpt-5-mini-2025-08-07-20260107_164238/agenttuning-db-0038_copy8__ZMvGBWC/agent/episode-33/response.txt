A previous command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't provided a question or requested schema exploration/modification. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as root over the local unix socket; I am currently idle and waiting for your instruction about what to query or change.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options you can choose now:\n- Provide a specific question (for example: \"How many rows in users where active=1?\") and, if known, the target database/table.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a given database; or DESCRIBE <table>). If you want schema exploration, tell me which database to inspect or allow me to start with 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide exact details.\nOnce you specify the action, I will explain the approach I will take and then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or produce the final answer (Action: Answer) when complete.",
