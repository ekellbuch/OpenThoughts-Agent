  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No additional databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't specified a question or asked me to explore the schema yet. The environment is ready to run SQL; I am waiting for your database question or instructions on what to inspect or modify.",
  "plan": "Tell me the question you want answered or what you want me to inspect/modify. Options you can request:\n- Explore schema: I can list databases, list tables in a database, and describe a table (one SQL statement at a time).\n- Query data: give me the target database/table and the conditions or aggregation you want and I'll produce a single SQL statement to run.\n- Modify data: describe the update/delete/insert you want and I will produce a single SQL statement.\nAfter you specify, I will: (1) explain the approach, (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run, and (3) analyze the returned output and continue until we reach the final answer.",
