  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A test command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't provided a question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to execute SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Choose one of the options below and provide any necessary details (database/table names, conditions, or desired modifications):\n- Ask a specific data question (e.g., \"How many rows in users where active=1?\"), and include the database/table if known.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a specified database; or DESCRIBE <table>). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the approach I will take and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You should run only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will then analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
