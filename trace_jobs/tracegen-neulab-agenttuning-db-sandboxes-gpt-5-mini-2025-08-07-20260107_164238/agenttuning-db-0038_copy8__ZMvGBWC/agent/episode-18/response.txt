A test command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet provided a question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to execute SQL statements as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options you can choose now:\n- Give a specific question (for example: \"How many rows in users where active=1?\"), and if you know it, the target database/table.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a specified database, or DESCRIBE a table). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) with exact details.\nWhen you specify, I will (1) explain the approach I will take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run only the first SQL code block I provide and return the output; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer (Action: Answer).",
