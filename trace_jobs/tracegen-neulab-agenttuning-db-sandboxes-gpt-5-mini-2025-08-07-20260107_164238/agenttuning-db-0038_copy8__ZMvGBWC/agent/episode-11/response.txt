  "analysis": "The container has both the MySQL client and server installed and the server is running. A previous test SELECT (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't provided a question or requested schema exploration. The environment is ready to execute SQL via the local mysql client (socket connection works).",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered, or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options you can request:\n- Explore schema: list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table (I will run one SQL statement at a time).\n- Query data: specify the target database/table and the condition or aggregation you want.\n- Modify data: specify the exact INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want performed and the target table/data.\nWhen you reply, I will: 1) explain the approach I'll take, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return its output, I'll analyze the result and either provide the next single SQL statement or produce the final answer (Action: Answer).",
