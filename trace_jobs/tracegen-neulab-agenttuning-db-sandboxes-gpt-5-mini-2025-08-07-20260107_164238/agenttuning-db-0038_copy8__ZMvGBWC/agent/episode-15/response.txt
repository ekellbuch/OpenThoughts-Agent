No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested schema exploration.

Options:\n- Ask a specific data question (for example: \"Count rows in users where active=1\") and, if known, provide the database/table name.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (for example: SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a given database). I will run one SQL statement at a time per your rules.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nWhen you specify, I will: (1) explain the approach I'll take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
