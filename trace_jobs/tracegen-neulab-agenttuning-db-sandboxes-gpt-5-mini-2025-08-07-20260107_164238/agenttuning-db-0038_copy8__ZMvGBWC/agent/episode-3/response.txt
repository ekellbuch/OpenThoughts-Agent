A test command was executed: mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-provided question or target database/table/query has been specified yet. Nothing else has been changed in the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your question (the SQL question you want answered). Once you provide it I will: 1) Choose whether to run exploratory SQL (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; USE <db>; SHOW TABLES;) or the specific query needed to answer your question. 2) For each operation I execute I will supply exactly one SQL statement in the required markdown format and only the first SQL block will be run. 3) After you provide the result(s) of that execution I will analyze the output and either run another SQL statement or provide the final answer. If you want me to inspect the schema first, I will run: SHOW DATABASES; then USE <db>; then SHOW TABLES; then DESCRIBE <table>; then the SELECT that answers your question. If you already know which database/table to query, tell me the question and the target database (or allow me to pick 'mysql' or another), and I'll produce the first SQL statement to run.",
