The MySQL client and server have been installed and started; a test command returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. I have not executed any user-directed SQL because you have not yet given a question or requested schema exploration/modification.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me what you want to do. Please choose one of the following and provide any necessary details (database/table names, conditions, or the exact modification):\n- Ask a specific data question (for example: \"How many rows in users where active=1?\"), optionally specifying the database/table.\n- Ask me to explore the schema. If you want exploration, indicate whether to start with SHOW DATABASES; or specify a database to run SHOW TABLES; or name a table to DESCRIBE it.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact desired change.\nWhen you specify which action you want, I will (1) explain the approach I will take and (2) either (a) perform an operation by providing exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute, or (b) produce the final answer if no further DB operations are needed.",
