A previous check (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to run SQL as root via the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options you can request:\n- Provide a specific question and (optionally) the target database/table (for example: \"How many rows in users where active=1?\").\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES in a given database, or DESCRIBE a table). If you request exploration, tell me which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide exact details.\nOnce you specify the action, I will explain my approach and provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return its output, I will analyze the result and continue or provide the final answer.",
