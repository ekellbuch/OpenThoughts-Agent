A test command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't provided a question or asked me to explore the schema further. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as root over the local unix socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered or request schema exploration. Options:\n- Provide a specific question and (optionally) the target database/table (e.g., \"How many rows in users where active=1?\").\n- Ask me to explore the schema (e.g., list databases, show tables in a given database, describe a table). If you want exploration, tell me which database to inspect or allow me to start with the 'mysql' database.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and give the exact change.\nWhen you reply, I will: 1) explain the approach I will take, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format. Per your rules, that statement will be presented as:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\nYou will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output. I will analyze that output and either supply another single SQL statement or, if finished, produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format.",
