A prior command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been examined because you haven't provided a question or asked me to explore the schema further. I'm connected locally via the unix socket and can run SQL statements as root.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want me to do with the database. Provide one of the following:\n- A specific question to answer (e.g., \"How many rows in table X where condition Y?\"). Also indicate the database and table if known.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (e.g., list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table). If you ask for exploration, specify which database to inspect or let me start with the 'mysql' database.\n- A modification you want executed (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) with details.\nAfter you provide the instruction, I will (1) explain the approach and (2) give exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL statement or produce the final answer (Action: Answer).",
