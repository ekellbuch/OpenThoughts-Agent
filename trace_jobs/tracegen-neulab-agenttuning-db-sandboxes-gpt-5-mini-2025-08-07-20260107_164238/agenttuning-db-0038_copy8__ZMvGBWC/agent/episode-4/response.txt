The server was started successfully and a test command showed the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet, and no further SQL has been executed. Nothing has been changed beyond installing and starting MySQL.",
  "plan": "I need your question about the database. Tell me what you want to find or modify (for example: list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, run a SELECT to answer some question, or perform an update). After you provide the question, I will either: 1) Run a single SQL statement (I will produce the exact SQL in the required format so you can execute it and return the output), or 2) If you prefer I can first explore the schema (SHOW DATABASES; then USE <db>; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE <table>), in which case I'll still provide one SQL statement at a time per your rules. Please state the question and, if applicable, the target database/table or whether you want me to explore the schema first.",
