To run SQL we need a running MySQL server or valid connection details to a remote server. No database/server has been accessed yet and no SQL has been executed against any database.",
  "plan": "Install and start a local MySQL server so we can execute SQL statements. Steps:\n1) Install the default MySQL server package. This will set up the server binaries and initial data directory. (DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to avoid prompts.)\n2) Check whether the mysqld process is running.\n3) If not running, start the mysql service using the init script/service command.\n4) Connect as local root via the unix socket and run a simple query to list databases: SHOW DATABASES; — since we're root in the container and the server typically allows socket-based root access, this should work. If authentication prevents connection, we'll inspect error output and adjust (e.g., check /var/log/mysql/error.log or use root credentials).",
