No user databases or tables have been examined because you haven't provided a question or asked me to explore the schema. The environment is ready to execute SQL, but I need your specific question or instructions about what to inspect or modify.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Please specify one of the following:\n- The question you want answered (e.g., \"How many users are in the users table?\").\n- Ask me to explore the schema (I can list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table). If you ask for exploration, tell me which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\n- A specific modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) you want performed and the target table and data.\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the approach I will take, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the output; I will then analyze it and continue with the next single SQL statement or give the final answer when complete.",
