  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client and server installed and the server is running. The local mysql client works over the unix socket as root. A prior test query returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet given a specific question or asked to explore the schema. The environment is ready to execute SQL statements as root.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options:\n- Provide a specific question (for example: \"Count rows in users where active=1\"), and if possible indicate the target database/table.\n- Ask me to explore the schema (e.g., list databases, show tables in a given database, describe a table). If you want exploration, indicate which database to inspect or allow me to start with the default 'mysql'.\n- Request a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and provide the exact change.\nOnce you specify, I will explain my approach and produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue the next single SQL statement or provide the final answer (Action: Answer).",
