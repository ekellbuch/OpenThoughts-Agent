  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. A prior command (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. The environment is ready to accept SQL commands as root via the local unix socket. You have not provided a specific database question or asked me to explore the schema yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Tell me one of the following so I can proceed:\n- A specific question to answer (e.g., \"How many rows in users where active=1?\"). If possible, include the database and table names.\n- Permission to explore the schema (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or, for a given database, SHOW TABLES; or DESCRIBE <table>;). Note that per your rules I will provide one SQL statement at a time in the required format for you to execute and return the results.\n- A modification you want performed (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) with exact details.\nAfter you choose, I will explain the approach I'll take and provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You should run only the first SQL block I provide and return its output; I will then analyze it and continue or produce the final answer.",
