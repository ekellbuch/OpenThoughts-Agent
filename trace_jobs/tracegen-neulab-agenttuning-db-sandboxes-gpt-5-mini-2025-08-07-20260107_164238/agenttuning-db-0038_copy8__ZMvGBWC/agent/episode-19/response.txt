  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A prior test (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases, tables, or rows have been inspected beyond that. The environment is ready to execute SQL statements as root over the local unix socket. I am awaiting your specific database question or instruction for schema exploration/modification.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact question you want answered or whether you want me to explore the schema first. Options you can request:\n- Explore schema: I can run SHOW DATABASES; then USE <db>; then SHOW TABLES; then DESCRIBE <table> — each will be issued one SQL statement at a time as you require.\n- Query data: specify the target database/table and the condition or aggregation you want and I will produce a single SQL statement to run.\n- Modify data: specify the exact INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want performed.\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the approach I will take for that specific request and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its output; I will analyze it and continue until the final answer is ready.",
