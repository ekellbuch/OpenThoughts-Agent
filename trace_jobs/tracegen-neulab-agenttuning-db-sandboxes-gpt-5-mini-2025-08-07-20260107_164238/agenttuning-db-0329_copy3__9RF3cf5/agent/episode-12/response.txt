  "analysis": "The container now has a running MySQL server and the mysql client. You can connect as root without a password. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases or tables have been examined because you have not specified any question or asked me to run further SQL. Therefore no database-level operations beyond starting the server have been performed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want to do with the database. Provide one precise request (examples below). Once you give the request I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and 2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (starting with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL code block). Useful example requests you can provide now:\n- \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- \"Describe table dbname.table\" -> DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" -> SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in dbname.table\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Or give any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want run.\nTell me which operation to perform (including the target database/table and any WHERE/LIMIT), and I will prepare the single SQL statement for you to execute.",
