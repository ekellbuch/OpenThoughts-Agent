  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. A prior SHOW DATABASES; run as root returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user question, target database, or table has been provided yet, and no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question or operation you want performed against the database (examples: list databases, list tables in a specific database, show rows from a table, count rows, run a specific SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE). Once you specify the request I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I will run. 2) Provide the operation by outputting exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue. Example useful requests you can ask now: - \"Show tables in database X\" - \"SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10\" - \"COUNT rows in db.table\" - \"Describe db.table\" If you’re not sure, you can ask me to list databases or to suggest next queries. Tell me which you want to do.",
