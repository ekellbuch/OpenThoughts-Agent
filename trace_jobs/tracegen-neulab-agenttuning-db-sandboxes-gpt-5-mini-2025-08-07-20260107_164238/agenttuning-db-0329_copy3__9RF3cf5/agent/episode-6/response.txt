  "analysis": "We have a running MySQL server in the container and the mysql client is installed. Earlier we successfully ran: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user databases visible. No specific question or target database/table has been provided in this session, so no further SQL operations have been executed. In short: environment ready (client + server + root access), but I need you to tell me what you want me to query or modify.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the exact question or operation. Tell me precisely what you want to do (examples below). Once you specify, I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I'll run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the output, I'll parse it and continue iteratively until you instruct me to produce the final answer. Example useful next operations you can ask for now: - List all databases: I'll run SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a specific database named dbname: I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; - Describe a table: I'll run DESCRIBE dbname.table; - Show up to 10 rows from a table: I'll run SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10; - Count rows in a table: I'll run SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table; - Run any specific SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE you need (you must state it). Please tell me which of the above (or another) operation you want me to perform.",
