Examples you can request (choose one and substitute names where needed):\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show up to 10 rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Run any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide exact statement).\nWhen you specify the single operation, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I will run, and (2) provide the operation formatted exactly as you required (starting with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block).",
