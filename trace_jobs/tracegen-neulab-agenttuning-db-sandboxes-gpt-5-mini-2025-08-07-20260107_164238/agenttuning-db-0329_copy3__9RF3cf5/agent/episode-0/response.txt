  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside a container. No prior MySQL commands have been run. We don't yet know if the MySQL client is installed, whether a MySQL server is running, or what credentials to use. To proceed with operating the database we need to (1) detect whether the mysql client is available, (2) check whether a mysqld server process is running, and (3) attempt to connect (e.g., as root) and list databases. After that, based on the database list and the specific question you ask, I'll craft a single-line SQL statement (in the required markdown SQL block format) to execute. I will only issue one SQL statement per round as you requested.",
  "plan": "1) Check for the mysql client binary (which mysql) and its version to ensure we can run SQL commands. 2) Check for a running mysqld process to confirm a server is available. 3) Attempt to connect as root without a password and run SHOW DATABASES to discover available databases. Depending on the output you provide after that, I will prepare the single SQL statement you want executed. Commands will be run in sequence; the mysql command may take slightly longer so I'll allow 1.0s for it.",
