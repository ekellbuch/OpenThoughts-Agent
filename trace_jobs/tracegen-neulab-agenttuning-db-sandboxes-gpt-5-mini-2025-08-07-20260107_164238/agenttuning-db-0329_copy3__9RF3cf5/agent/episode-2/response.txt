  "analysis": "The mysql client was installed successfully but there is no MySQL server running in the container (mysql client error: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket). To operate a database we need a running mysqld. The container currently lacks a server process, so we must install/start a MySQL server (or MariaDB) and then connect. After starting the server we can run one SQL statement (as you require) to inspect databases/tables or fulfill the user's query.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL server package (default-mysql-server) so a server binary and init scripts are present. 2) Start the MySQL service. 3) Connect as root and run SHOW DATABASES; to confirm the server is running and list databases. If authentication prevents a root socket login, we'll inspect the error in the next round and adjust (e.g., use sudo mysql or reset root password).",
