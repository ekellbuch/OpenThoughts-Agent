A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys).

The environment is ready for SQL operations, but you haven't specified any question or the exact operation to perform.",

Please specify one precise request (for example: list all databases; list tables in a specific database; describe a table; select rows from a table with optional WHERE/LIMIT; count rows in a table; or perform an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE — provide exact details). Once you specify the operation, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and (2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue.",
