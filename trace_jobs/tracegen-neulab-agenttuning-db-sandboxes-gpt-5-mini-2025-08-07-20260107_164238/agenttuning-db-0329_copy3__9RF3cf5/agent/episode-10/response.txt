A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user-created databases visible yet. You have not specified any question or the database/table to operate on, so no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give a specific request. Please tell me exactly what you want to do (examples: list all databases; list tables in a specific database; describe a table; select rows from a table with optional WHERE/LIMIT; count rows; or perform an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). When you specify the operation I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (begin with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, then I will parse it and continue until you tell me to finalize with 'Action: Answer'.",
