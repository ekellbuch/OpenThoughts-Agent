  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. A prior SHOW DATABASES; executed as root returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user-created databases visible. No specific question, target database, or SQL operation has been provided by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want to do with the database. Examples you can ask for: 1) List all databases (SHOW DATABASES;). 2) List tables in a specific database (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;). 3) Describe a table (DESCRIBE dbname.table;). 4) Select rows from a table (SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;). 5) Count rows in a table (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;). 6) Run an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (state exact statement). When you specify the desired operation, I will: - Explain my reasoning and the exact single-line SQL I will run. - If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format beginning with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block (```sql ... ```). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iterating until you tell me to finalize with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.",
