  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container, and the mysql client is available. Connecting as root without a password works. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases visible. No specific question or target database/table was provided yet, so no further SQL operations have been performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question you want answered or the operation you want performed (for example: list databases, list tables in a database, show rows from a table, count rows, run a specific SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT). Once you state the request I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the SQL I plan to run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n   - Begin with: Action: Operation\n   - Then a single SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block (```sql ... ```). 3) You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iterating until you tell me to produce the final answer. Example useful next commands I can run after you specify a target database: - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE ...; If you want me to perform an operation now, tell me which database/table and what you need.",
