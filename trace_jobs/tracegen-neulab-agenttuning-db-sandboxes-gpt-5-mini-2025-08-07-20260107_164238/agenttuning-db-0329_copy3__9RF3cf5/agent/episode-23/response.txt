  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give a specific operation. Tell me exactly what you want to do with the database (pick one and provide database/table names as needed). Examples you can request: 1) \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES; 2) \"List tables in database dbname\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; 3) \"Describe table dbname.table\" -> DESCRIBE dbname.table; 4) \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" -> SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10; 5) \"Count rows in dbname.table\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table; or 6) provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want run. Once you specify the single operation, I will (a) explain my reasoning and the SQL I'll run, and (b) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block).",
