A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables visible. You have not specified any specific question or the exact SQL operation to perform, so no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you tell me the exact single operation you want performed. Please specify one precise request (include database/table names if applicable). Examples you can choose from:\n- \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <dbname>\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n- \"Describe table <dbname>.<table>\" -> DESCRIBE <dbname>.<table>;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from <dbname>.<table>\" -> SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in <dbname>.<table>\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed (include DB/table and any WHERE/LIMIT).\nWhen you specify the single operation, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I will run, and 2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue.",
