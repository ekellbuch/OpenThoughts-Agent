A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). You have not provided any question, target database, or table to operate on. No SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Examples you can request: (1) list all databases, (2) list tables in a specific database, (3) describe a table, (4) show rows from a table (optionally with LIMIT or WHERE), (5) count rows in a table, or (6) perform an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide exact details). Once you specify the operation I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I'll run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (beginning with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the output, and I'll continue iterating until you tell me to finalize with 'Action: Answer'.",
