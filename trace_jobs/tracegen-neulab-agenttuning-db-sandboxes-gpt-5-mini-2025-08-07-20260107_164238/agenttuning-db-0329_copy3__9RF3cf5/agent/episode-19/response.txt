A previous SHOW DATABASES; run as root returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases or tables have been discovered because you have not requested any further inspection. Currently no SQL is being executed and the environment is ready for queries.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want to do with the database. Provide one explicit request (pick one):\n- \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- \"Describe table dbname.table\" -> DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" -> SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in dbname.table\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement (include database/table and any WHERE/LIMIT).\nWhen you specify the single operation, I will (1) explain my reasoning and the exact single-line SQL I will run, and (2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block. You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue. If you want me to suggest the next query instead, tell me which direction (inspect DBs, inspect tables, read data, modify data).",
