Earlier we ran SHOW DATABASES; which returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-created databases or tables have been discovered because you have not requested further inspection. Currently no SQL is being executed and the environment is ready for queries.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want to do with the database. Provide one precise operation (for example):\n- \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- \"Describe table dbname.table\" -> DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" -> SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in dbname.table\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Or give any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want run (specify db/table and conditions).\nWhen you specify the single operation, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I'll run, and (2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format beginning with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until you tell me to finalize with \"Action: Answer\".",
