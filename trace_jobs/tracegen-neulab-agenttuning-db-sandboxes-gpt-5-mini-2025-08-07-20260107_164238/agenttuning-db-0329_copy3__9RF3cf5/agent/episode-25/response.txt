  "analysis": "You have a running MySQL server in the container and the mysql client is installed. Connecting as root without a password works. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not specified any SQL query or operation to perform. The environment is ready for queries, but I cannot proceed until you tell me the exact operation you want.",
  "plan": "Tell me exactly which single operation you want me to perform against the database. Provide one precise request including database and table names if applicable (examples: \"List all databases\", \"Show tables in database dbname\", \"Describe table dbname.table\", \"SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10\", \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table\", or an exact INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). Once you specify the operation I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and 2) output the operation in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue.",
