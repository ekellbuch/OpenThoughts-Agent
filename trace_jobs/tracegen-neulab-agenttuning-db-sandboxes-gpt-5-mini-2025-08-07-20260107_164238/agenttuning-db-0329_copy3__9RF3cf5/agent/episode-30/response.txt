Previously running mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested any SQL operation.

  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which single SQL operation you want me to prepare and run. Per your rules, when you ask me to operate I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I'll run, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format beginning with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block. Examples of operations you can request (pick one and provide database/table names as needed):\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show up to 10 rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed.\nPlease state the single operation you want me to perform (include the target database/table and any WHERE/LIMIT conditions). Once you specify it, I will (a) explain my reasoning and (b) output the one SQL statement in the exact 'Action: Operation' format you require so you can execute it and return the output.",
