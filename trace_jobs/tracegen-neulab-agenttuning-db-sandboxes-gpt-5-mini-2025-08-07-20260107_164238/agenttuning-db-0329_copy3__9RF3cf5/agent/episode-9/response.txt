Once you specify, I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the exact single-line SQL I'll run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL code block). Example requests you can give me now: - \"List all databases\" (I would run: SHOW DATABASES;) - \"List tables in database dbname\" (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;) - \"Describe table dbname.table\" (I would run: DESCRIBE dbname.table;) - \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" (I would run: SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;) - \"Count rows in dbname.table\" (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;) - Any precise INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (give exact details). Tell me which operation to run.",
