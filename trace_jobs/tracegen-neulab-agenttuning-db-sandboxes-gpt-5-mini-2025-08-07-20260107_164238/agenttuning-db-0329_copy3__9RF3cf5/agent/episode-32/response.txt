A prior mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-created databases or tables have been identified because you have not requested further inspection.

  "plan": "Tell me exactly which single SQL operation you want me to perform. Provide one precise request (include database/table names and any WHERE/LIMIT as needed). Examples you can pick from: 1) \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES; 2) \"List tables in database <dbname>\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; 3) \"Describe table <dbname>.<table>\" -> DESCRIBE <dbname>.<table>; 4) \"Show up to 10 rows from <dbname>.<table>\" -> SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10; 5) \"Count rows in <dbname>.<table>\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>; or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement. Once you specify the single operation, I will (a) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and (b) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block).",
