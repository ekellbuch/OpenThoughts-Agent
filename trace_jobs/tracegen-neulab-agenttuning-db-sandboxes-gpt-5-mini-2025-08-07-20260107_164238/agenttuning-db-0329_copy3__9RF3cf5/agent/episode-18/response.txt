  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. You can connect as root without a password. A prior SHOW DATABASES; run as root returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases visible. No specific question, target database, or SQL operation has been provided in this session, so I have not executed any SQL in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Provide one precise operation (examples below). Once you specify the operation I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and 2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (begin with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). Example operations you can request now (replace dbname/table as needed):\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- Describe a table: DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- Show up to 10 rows from a table: SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Run any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide exact statement).\nTell me which single operation to perform and I will prepare the SQL statement accordingly.",
