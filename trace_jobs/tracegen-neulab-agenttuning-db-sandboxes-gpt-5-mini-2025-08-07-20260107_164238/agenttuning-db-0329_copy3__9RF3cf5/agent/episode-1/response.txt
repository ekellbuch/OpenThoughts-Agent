  "analysis": "The container currently has no mysql client installed: 'which mysql' returned nothing and 'mysql --version' reported 'command not found'. No mysqld process is running (ps returned nothing). Because the client is missing we cannot run SQL yet. To proceed we must install a MySQL/MariaDB client binary, then attempt to connect (e.g., as root) and run SHOW DATABASES; to discover available databases and tables. If the server is not running or requires credentials, additional steps will be needed afterwards.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package index to ensure we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so we can run mysql commands. 3) Verify the client is installed and get its version. 4) Attempt to connect to the local server as root and run SHOW DATABASES; to list databases. This will reveal whether a server is running and which databases exist. If connection fails, we'll inspect the error and decide next steps (start/install server or ask for connection credentials).",
