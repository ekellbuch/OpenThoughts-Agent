A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables visible. You have not provided a specific question or the exact SQL operation to run, so I have not executed any SQL in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which single operation you want me to perform against the database. Pick one precise request and include database/table names if applicable. Examples you can choose from (give me one):\n- \"List all databases\" → SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" → SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- \"Describe a table\" → DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from a table\" → SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in a table\" → SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed (include db/table and conditions).\nWhen you specify the single operation, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the exact one-line SQL I will run, and (2) output the operation formatted exactly per your rules (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block).",
