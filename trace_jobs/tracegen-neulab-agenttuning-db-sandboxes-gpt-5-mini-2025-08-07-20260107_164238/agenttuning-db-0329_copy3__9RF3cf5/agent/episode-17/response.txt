  "analysis": "You are in a container with a working MySQL server and client. The mysql client is installed and mysqld is running. A previous SHOW DATABASES; executed as root returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not specified any further request. Currently no SQL is being executed and the environment is ready for queries as root without a password.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me exactly what you want to do. Please specify one precise operation or question (examples):\n- \"List all databases\" -> run SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" -> run SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- \"Describe table dbname.table\" -> run DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" -> run SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in dbname.table\" -> run SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement (include database/table and any WHERE/LIMIT).\nWhen you specify the single operation, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the exact single-line SQL I will run, and (2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (starting with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue until you tell me to finalize with 'Action: Answer'.",
