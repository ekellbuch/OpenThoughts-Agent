Provide one precise operation (examples):\n- List all databases -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database -> SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- Describe a table -> DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- Show rows from a table -> SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement (include database/table and any WHERE/LIMIT).\nOnce you specify the single operation, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the one-line SQL I will run, and 2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (begin with 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block).",
