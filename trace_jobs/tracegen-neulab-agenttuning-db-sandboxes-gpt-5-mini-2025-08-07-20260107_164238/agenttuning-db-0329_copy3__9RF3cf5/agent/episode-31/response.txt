  "analysis": "You are in a container with a working MySQL server (mysqld) and the mysql client. I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server earlier and verified the server is running. Connecting as root without a password works. A prior mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables discovered because you have not specified any target or question. The environment is ready for SQL operations, but I cannot run any meaningful SQL without a precise request from you.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me the exact single operation you want performed. Please specify one precise request (include database/table names and any WHERE/LIMIT conditions as needed). Examples you can pick from:\n- \"List all databases\" → SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <dbname>\" → SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n- \"Describe table <dbname>.<table>\" → DESCRIBE <dbname>.<table>;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from <dbname>.<table>\" → SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in <dbname>.<table>\" → SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed.\nWhen you specify the single operation I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the exact one-line SQL I will run, and (2) if you choose to operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iterating until you direct me to finalize with 'Action: Answer'.",
