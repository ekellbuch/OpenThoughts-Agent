  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. You can connect as root without a password. A prior command (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases visible. No specific question, target database, or SQL operation has been provided in this session, so I have not executed any SQL this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact operation or question you want run against the database. Examples you can request now (pick one and supply the database/table name if applicable):\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database (replace dbname): SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- Describe a table (replace dbname.table): DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- Show up to 10 rows from a table: SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;\n- Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide exact details).\nOnce you specify the exact operation (including db/table and any WHERE/LIMIT), I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I'll run, and 2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (beginning with 'Action: Operation' and followed by a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue until you tell me to finalize with 'Action: Answer'.",
