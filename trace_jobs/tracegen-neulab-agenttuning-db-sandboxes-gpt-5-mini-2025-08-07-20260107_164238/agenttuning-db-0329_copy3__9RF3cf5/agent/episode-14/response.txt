Example requests you can give now: - \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES; - \"List tables in database dbname\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; - \"Describe table dbname.table\" -> DESCRIBE dbname.table; - \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" -> SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10; - \"Count rows in dbname.table\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table; - Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want executed (specify db/table and conditions). Tell me which single operation to perform.",
