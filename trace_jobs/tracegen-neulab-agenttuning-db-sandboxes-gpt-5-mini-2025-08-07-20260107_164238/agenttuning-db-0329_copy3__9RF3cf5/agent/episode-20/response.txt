  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server earlier and confirmed mysqld is running and that connecting as root without a password works. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-created databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet specified any question or the exact operation you want performed. Right now there is nothing further executed in the shell.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me the exact question or database operation you want. Once you specify it I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and 2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: starting with the line 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block (```sql ... ```). After you execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue iterating until you instruct me to finalize with 'Action: Answer'.\n\nIf you are unsure what to ask next, here are sensible next-step options you can pick from (tell me which one and, where needed, provide the database/table name):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show up to 10 rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Run any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide exact db/table and conditions).\n\nWhen you pick one, I will provide the single SQL statement in the exact 'Action: Operation' format you required.",
