A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases visible. No specific question or target database/table has been provided in this session, so I have not executed any further SQL.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me exactly what you want to do. Please specify one precise operation or question (examples below). Once you specify it I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I plan to run, and 2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). Example operations you can request now:\n- \"List all databases\" (SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;)\n- \"Describe table dbname.table\" (DESCRIBE dbname.table;)\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from dbname.table\" (SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;)\n- \"Count rows in dbname.table\" (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table;)\n- Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide exact details)\nTell me which of the above (or another) operation you want me to perform, and I will prepare the single SQL statement for you to execute.",
