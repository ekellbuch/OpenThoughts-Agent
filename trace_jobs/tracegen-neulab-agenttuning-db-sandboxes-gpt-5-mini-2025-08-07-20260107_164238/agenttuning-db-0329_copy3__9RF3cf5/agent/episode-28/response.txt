A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-created databases or tables have been identified because you have not specified a target or query. The environment is ready for SQL commands but no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify exactly one operation to run against the database. Pick one precise request (and supply database/table names if needed). After you specify, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run; 2) output the operation in the exact required format if you choose to operate (starting with 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block). Example operations you can request (pick one):\n- \"List all databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <dbname>\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n- \"Describe table <dbname>.<table>\" -> DESCRIBE <dbname>.<table>;\n- \"Show up to 10 rows from <dbname>.<table>\" -> SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- \"Count rows in <dbname>.<table>\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <dbname>.<table>;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed (include db/table and any WHERE/LIMIT).\nTell me which single operation to perform and I will prepare the SQL statement accordingly.",
