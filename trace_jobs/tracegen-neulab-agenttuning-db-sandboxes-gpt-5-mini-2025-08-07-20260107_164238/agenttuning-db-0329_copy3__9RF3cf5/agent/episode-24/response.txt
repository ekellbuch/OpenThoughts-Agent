Earlier we ran SHOW DATABASES; and saw only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not specified any question or operation to perform. The environment is ready for SQL operations but I cannot proceed without a precise request from you.",
  "plan": "Tell me exactly what you want to do with the database. Give one precise operation (include database/table names and any conditions). Examples you can request (pick one and substitute names where needed):\n- List all databases -> I will run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database -> I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table -> I will run: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show up to 10 rows from a table -> I will run: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows in a table -> I will run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed.\nWhen you specify the operation I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I'll run, and (2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block).",
