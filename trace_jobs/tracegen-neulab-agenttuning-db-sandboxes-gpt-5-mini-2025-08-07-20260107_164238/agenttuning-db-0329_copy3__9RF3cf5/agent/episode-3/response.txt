A connection as root without a password works: SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases were shown yet.

Tell me what you want to find out or modify (for example: list tables in a particular database, show rows from a table, count rows, perform a join, update/delete/insert). When you specify the question (which database/table and any conditions), I will: 1) Explain my thinking and the SQL I'll use. 2) If you want me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required markdown format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the output, I'll continue iterating until you tell me to finalize the answer. If you prefer, I can suggest likely next queries such as: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table; DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;",
