A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not specified any question or operation to perform. The environment is ready to run SQL, but I cannot proceed until you tell me exactly which single operation you want executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify one precise database operation. When you provide it I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the single-line SQL I will run, and (2) if you choose to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' and followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block). Examples you can request (pick one and supply database/table names where applicable): - List all databases: SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; - Describe a table: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table; - Show up to 10 rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10; - Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table; - Or provide any exact SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement you want executed. Provide the single operation now and I will produce the corresponding SQL statement.",
