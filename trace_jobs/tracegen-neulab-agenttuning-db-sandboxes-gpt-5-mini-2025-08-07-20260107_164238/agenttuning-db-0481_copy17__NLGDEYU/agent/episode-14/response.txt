A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) earlier returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept queries.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions about which database/table to use). 2) If I decide to operate on the database, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will parse that output, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format you specified. \n\nIf you prefer, choose one of these diagnostic queries for me to run now and I will produce the Operation block for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which diagnostic query to run or state your specific question.",
