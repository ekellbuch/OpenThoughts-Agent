The mariadbd process is running as user mysql, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a previous test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question or for you to pick a diagnostic query to run. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including assumptions). 2) If I decide to operate on the database, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse the output, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.\n\nIf you'd like, choose one of these diagnostic queries now and I will produce the Operation block for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nOr state your own question and I'll prepare the appropriate SQL.",
