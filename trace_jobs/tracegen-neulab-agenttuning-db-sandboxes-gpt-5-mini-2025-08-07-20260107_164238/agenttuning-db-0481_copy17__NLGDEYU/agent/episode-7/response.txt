The mariadbd process runs as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a previous test query (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific user question or additional SQL has been provided yet, so no further database actions have been taken.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide a specific database question or tell me which diagnostic query you'd like run. Options you can request now:\n- Ask a specific question about the data (e.g., \"Which users have X?\", \"Top 10 orders by amount\", etc.). I will explain my reasoning and, if needed, run SQL.\n- Ask a diagnostic query I can run immediately (examples below). If you want me to operate, I will produce exactly the required Operation pattern with a single-line SQL statement in a code block; you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output, which I will parse and explain.\n\nSuggested diagnostic queries you can ask me to run now (pick one or provide your own question):\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n\nTell me which query or question you want addressed. If you want me to run a query now, say which one and I will produce the Action: Operation block with the single SQL statement as required.",
