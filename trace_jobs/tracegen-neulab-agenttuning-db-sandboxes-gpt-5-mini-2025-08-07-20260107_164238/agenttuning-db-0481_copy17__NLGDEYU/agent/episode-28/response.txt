The mariadbd process runs as user mysql, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a prior test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been executed. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I am waiting for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and the assumptions about which database/tables are relevant; (2) write the exact single SQL statement needed and show it in the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown sql code block); (3) you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me; (4) I will parse the output, explain the results, and either run another Operation or, when finished, provide the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format. If you prefer a diagnostic query now, pick one of these and I will produce the single-statement Operation for you to run: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; SHOW TABLES FROM sys;",
