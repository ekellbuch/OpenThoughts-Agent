The mariadbd process is running as user mysql, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a prior test query returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No specific database question or SQL to execute has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been run.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and what SQL is required (including any assumptions). 2) If I need to run SQL, I will output exactly the required pattern: 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block. You will execute that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it, explain the results, and continue with further operations or provide the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern when complete.\n\nIf you prefer, you can instruct me to run one of these diagnostic queries now and I will produce the required Operation block:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nPlease state your question or which diagnostic query to run.",
