  "analysis": "You are in a container shell (root@d6e1bc17f152:/app). No MySQL client or database connection has been attempted yet. To answer database questions I need to connect to MySQL (or MariaDB) and run SQL. First I should detect whether a mysql client is available and whether a server is running, then try a simple SQL command (SHOW DATABASES) to confirm connectivity. Depending on that output I'll proceed to run the specific SQL you request.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the `mysql` client binary is present. 2) Attempt to connect as root without a password and run `SHOW DATABASES;` to verify connectivity and list available databases. 3) If the previous step fails, list running processes to see if mysqld is running. These checks will tell us how to proceed (e.g., provide credentials, start the server, or adjust connection parameters).",
