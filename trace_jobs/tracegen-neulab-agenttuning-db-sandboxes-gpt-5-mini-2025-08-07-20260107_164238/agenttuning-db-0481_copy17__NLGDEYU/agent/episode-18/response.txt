When you provide it I will: (1) explain the problem and my reasoning about the SQL needed (including assumptions about schema); (2) decide whether to operate on the database; (3) if operating, output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nyou will execute the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will parse the output, explain results, and repeat operations as needed until I can produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format.\n\nIf you want a diagnostic query now, pick one of these and I will prepare the single SQL statement in the required Operation format for you to run:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which query or state your question and I will proceed.",
