The mariadbd process runs as user mysql, /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys).

  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide a specific database question or to pick a diagnostic query to run. When you give a question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions). 2) Choose whether to operate or to answer directly. If I operate, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will parse it, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when done, provide the final answer in the exact Action: Answer pattern you specified.\n\nIf you want me to run a diagnostic query now, pick one of these or state your own:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which query or question to run. I will then prepare the single SQL statement in the required format.",
