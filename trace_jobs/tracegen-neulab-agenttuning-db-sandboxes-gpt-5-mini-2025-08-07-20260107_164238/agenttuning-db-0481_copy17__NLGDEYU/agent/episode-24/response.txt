No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided yet, so no additional queries have been executed. The server is ready to accept SQL over the local socket.",

When you provide it I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question, the assumptions about which database/tables are relevant, and the SQL needed. 2) Decide whether to operate on the database or to answer directly. If operating, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<one-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output, explain the results, and either run further operations or, when sure, provide the final answer using the exact pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you want a diagnostic query now, tell me which one to run (examples: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; SHOW TABLES FROM sys).",
