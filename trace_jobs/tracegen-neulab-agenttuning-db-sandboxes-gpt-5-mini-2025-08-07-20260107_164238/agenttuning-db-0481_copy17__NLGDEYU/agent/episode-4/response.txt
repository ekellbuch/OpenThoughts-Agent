  "analysis": "I started and verified a MariaDB server inside the container. Observations from the terminal output:\n- mariadbd binary exists at /usr/sbin/mariadbd and /usr/sbin/mysqld is a symlink to it.\n- The /var/lib/mysql data directory is present and owned by the mysql user.\n- I created /run/mysqld with ownership mysql:mysql and started mariadbd as the mysql user (using runuser). The server started successfully and created /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and /run/mysqld/mariadbd.pid.\n- A test mysql client command (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") succeeded and returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys).\n\nConclusion: The database server is running and reachable via the local socket. We can now run SQL queries against it as requested.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you give me a question, I will:\n1) Think through the schema and what SQL is needed and explain my reasoning and expected outcome.\n2) If I decide to operate on the DB, I'll output exactly the required Operation pattern followed by a single SQL statement in one-line markdown code block. You said you will execute the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me. After you return the output I will parse it, explain the results, and either run another operation or, if finished, provide the final Answer pattern.\n\nIf you want me to run an initial diagnostic query now, I can (for example: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; or SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;). Otherwise, please state your question and I will prepare the SQL to execute.",
