  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running inside the container. The mariadbd process runs as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test command (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or additional SQL has been provided yet, so no further queries have been executed. The server is ready to accept SQL statements over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions about which database/table to use). 2) Decide whether to operate on the database. If I operate, I will output exactly the required pattern: \n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\n(You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me.) 3) I will parse the returned output, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when finished, produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you prefer, you may ask me to run a diagnostic query now. Suggested diagnostics you can request immediately: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; SHOW TABLES FROM sys. Tell me your question or which diagnostic query to run and I will prepare the single SQL statement in the required format.",
