No specific database question or SQL command has been requested by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you give the question I will:\n1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about the SQL needed and the expected result.\n2) If I decide to operate on the database, I will output the required Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (and nothing else). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will parse the output, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when finished, provide the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer.\n\nIf you want me to run a diagnostic query now, pick one of these and I will produce the Operation block for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which query or ask your question. I will then prepare the single SQL statement in the required format.",
