The mariadbd process runs as user mysql, /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a prior test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL to execute has been provided in this round, so I have not executed any additional SQL. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is required (including assumptions about which database/table to use). 2) Decide whether to operate on the database. If I operate, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n   Action: Operation\n   ```sql\n   <single-line SQL statement>;\n   ```\n   (You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me.) 3) I will parse the returned output, explain results, and either run another operation or, when finished and certain, produce the final answer in the exact pattern:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you want me to run a diagnostic query now, choose one of these and I will produce the single-statement Operation block for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me your specific question or which diagnostic query to run.",
