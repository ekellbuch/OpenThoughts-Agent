  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container. The mariadbd process runs as user mysql, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a prior test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact database question you want answered or pick a diagnostic query to run. Options you can request now (pick one or give your own):\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nWhen you provide the question, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and what SQL is needed, and 2) if I decide to operate, I will output exactly the required Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output to me). After you return the output I will parse it, explain results, and continue until I can produce the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer.",
