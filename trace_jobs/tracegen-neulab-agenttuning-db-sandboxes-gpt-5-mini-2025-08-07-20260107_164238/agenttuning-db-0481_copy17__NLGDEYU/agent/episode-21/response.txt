The mariadbd process runs as user mysql, /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a previous test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you in this round, so I have not executed any additional SQL. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you'd like answered. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the SQL needed (including any assumptions), (2) decide whether to operate on the database, and if so produce the required Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (you will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output), and (3) parse the returned output, explain the results, and repeat operations as needed until I can provide the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format you requested.\n\nIf you prefer, ask one of these diagnostic queries now and I'll prepare the single SQL statement to run:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which query or state your specific question.",
