A previous test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided in this round, so no further SQL has been executed. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions about which database/table to use); (2) if an operation is required, output exactly the required Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute only the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me); (3) parse the returned output, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when certain, output the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.\n\nIf you prefer, tell me which diagnostic query to run now (pick one) and I will produce the single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; SHOW TABLES FROM sys; or provide your own question.",
