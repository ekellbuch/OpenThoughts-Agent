When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and the SQL needed (including any assumptions about which database/table to use); (2) if I decide to operate on the database, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will parse that output, explain results, and either run another operation or, when certain, provide the final answer in the exact pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you want a diagnostic query now, pick one of these and I will prepare the single SQL statement for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which query or state your specific question and I will proceed.",
