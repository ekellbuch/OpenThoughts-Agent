To run SQL queries I need a MySQL-compatible server and a client. Nothing has been attempted to install or start a database server yet.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package index. 2) Install MariaDB server and client (provides mysqld and mysql client). 3) Start the MariaDB server. 4) Run a simple SQL command (SHOW DATABASES;) to confirm the server is up and reachable. If the server fails to start, we'll inspect logs and adjust. Expected results: after installation and start, the mysql client should be available and SHOW DATABASES; will list default databases.",
