The mariadbd process is running as the mysql user, /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query previously returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys).

When you give a question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and what SQL is required. 2) If I decide to operate, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it, explain the results, and continue until a final answer can be produced. If you want a diagnostic query now, choose one (examples): SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; or provide your own question.",
