  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running inside the container. The mariadbd process is running as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No further SQL has been executed since then and the server is ready to accept queries.",
  "plan": "I'm waiting for your specific database question. When you provide it, I will:\n1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is required (include expected results and any assumptions about schema).\n2) Choose whether to operate (run a SQL statement) or directly answer. If I operate, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n   - Action: Operation\n   ```sql\n   <single-line SQL statement>;\n   ```\n   (You will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me.)\n3) I will parse the returned output, explain the results, and repeat operations as needed until I can produce the final answer.\n\nIf you'd like, I can run an initial diagnostic query (examples below). Tell me which one to run or ask your question:\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table structure: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Preview rows: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n\nState your question or which diagnostic query you'd like me to run. Remember: when I choose to operate, I will present exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format and you will execute it and provide the output.",
