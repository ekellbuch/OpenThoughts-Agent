  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the specific database question or to choose a diagnostic query. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions about schema), (2) choose whether to operate on the database, and if so output exactly the required Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output), (3) parse the returned output, explain the results, and repeat until I can produce the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer. If you want a diagnostic query run now, pick one of these and I will produce the Operation block: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; SHOW TABLES FROM sys; or provide your own question.",
