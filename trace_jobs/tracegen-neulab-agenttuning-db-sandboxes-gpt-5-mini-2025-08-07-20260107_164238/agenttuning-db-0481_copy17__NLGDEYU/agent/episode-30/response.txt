No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept queries.",

Once you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the problem and the SQL required (including assumptions about which database/table to use), (2) choose whether to operate on the database or answer directly, and (3) if I operate, output exactly the required Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output). After you return the output I will parse it, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when certain, provide the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer.",
