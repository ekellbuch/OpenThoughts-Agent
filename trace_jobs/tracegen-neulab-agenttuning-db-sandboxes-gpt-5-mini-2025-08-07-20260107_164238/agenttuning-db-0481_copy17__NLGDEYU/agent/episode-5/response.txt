The server process (mariadbd) is running as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No further actions have been taken since the server is ready to accept SQL commands.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed. 2) Choose whether to operate (run a SQL statement) or directly answer. If I operate, I will output an Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block, as you requested. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse it, explain results, and continue until we can produce the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer.",
