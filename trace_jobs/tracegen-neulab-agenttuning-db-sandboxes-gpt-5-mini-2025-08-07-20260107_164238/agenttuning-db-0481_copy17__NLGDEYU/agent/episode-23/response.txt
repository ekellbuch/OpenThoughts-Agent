The mariadbd process is running as user mysql, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a prior test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or further SQL statement has been provided by you yet, so no additional queries have been executed. The server is ready to accept SQL over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question to answer. When you give the question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the problem and the SQL needed (including assumptions about which database/table to use), (2) choose whether to operate on the database or answer directly, and (3) if I operate, output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will parse that output, explain the results, and repeat operations as needed until I produce the final answer in the exact pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you want a diagnostic query now, tell me which of these to run and I will produce the single-statement Operation block for you to execute: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; SHOW TABLES FROM sys; or provide your own question.",
