The mariadbd process is running as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No specific database question or SQL to run has been provided by you yet, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept queries.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: (1) explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is required (including any assumptions about schema), (2) decide whether to operate or answer, and (3) if operating, output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute that SQL (the first SQL code block) and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will parse the output, explain results, and continue with further operations as needed until I produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format.",
