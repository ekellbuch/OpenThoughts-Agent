The mariadbd process is running as user mysql, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and an earlier test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you in this session, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered, or select one of the suggested diagnostic queries so I can run it. Once you specify the question or query I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the SQL required (assumptions and expected result). 2) If I operate on the DB, I will output exactly the required Action: Operation block containing one single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output). 3) I will parse the output you return, explain results, and repeat operations as needed until we can produce the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer.\n\nPick one of these diagnostic queries now or provide your own question:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nAfter you tell me which query or give your question, I will prepare the single SQL statement in the required format.",
