The mariadbd process is running as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a previous test query returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the specific database question to answer. When you provide it I will: (1) Explain my reasoning and the SQL needed; (2) If an operation is required, output exactly the required Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output); (3) Parse the returned output, explain results, and repeat until I can produce the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer. If you prefer, tell me which diagnostic query to run now (examples below) and I will produce the Operation block:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nPlease state your question or which diagnostic query to run.",
