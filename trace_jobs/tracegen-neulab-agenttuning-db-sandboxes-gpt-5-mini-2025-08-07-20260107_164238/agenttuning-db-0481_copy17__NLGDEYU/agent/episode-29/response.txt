A prior test query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided by you in this round, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept queries over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database question you want me to answer. When you provide it I will:\n1) Explain my understanding of the question and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions about which database/table to use). \n2) Decide whether to operate on the database. If I operate, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will parse that output, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when certain, provide the final answer in the exact pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you prefer, ask one of these diagnostic queries now and I will prepare the single SQL statement for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me the exact question or which diagnostic query to run. If you want me to run a query now, I will produce the Action: Operation block with a single-line SQL statement as shown above.",
