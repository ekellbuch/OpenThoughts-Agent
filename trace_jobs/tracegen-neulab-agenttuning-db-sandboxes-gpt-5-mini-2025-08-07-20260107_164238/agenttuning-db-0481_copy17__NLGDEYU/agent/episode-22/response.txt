No specific database question or SQL statement has been provided in this round, so I have not executed any further SQL. The server is ready to accept SQL statements over the local socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: 1) explain my understanding of the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed (including any assumptions about schema); 2) decide whether to operate on the database or answer directly; 3) if I operate, produce exactly the required pattern: an Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block (you will execute that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output); 4) parse the returned output, explain the results, and repeat until I can produce the final Action: Answer with the exact final answer.\n\nIf you want me to run a diagnostic query now, pick one of these and I will output the required Operation block (one single-line SQL statement) for you to execute:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me which query or state your specific question and I will proceed.",
