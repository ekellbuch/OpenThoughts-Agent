  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running inside the container. The mariadbd process runs as the mysql user, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL to execute has been provided yet, so I have not run any additional queries. The server is ready to accept SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about the SQL needed (including assumptions). 2) Decide whether to operate on the database. If I operate, I will output exactly the required pattern:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\n(You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me.) After you return the output I will parse it, explain the results, and either run another operation or, when finished, provide the final answer in the exact Action: Answer pattern.\n\nIf you want me to run a diagnostic query now, tell me which one. Examples you can ask me to run immediately:\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM sys;\n\nTell me your question or which diagnostic query to run and I'll proceed.",
