  "analysis": "You have opened a shell at root@8387b8ebffd7:/app with no prior commands or outputs related to a MySQL database. Nothing has been queried or modified yet. I do not have a MySQL question from you yet nor any database connection details (hostname, port, user, password, database name). According to your protocol, I must produce one SQL statement in a single markdown code block when I choose to operate; I will not execute SQL here myself — you will run it and return the raw MySQL output for me to process. Right now there is nothing to execute.",
  "plan": "I will not run any database commands until you provide the question and (if needed) connection details or confirm you will run the SQL I supply. Next steps: 1) You should tell me the question you want answered about the MySQL database. 2) If you want me to craft SQL to run directly, confirm which database to target (host/port/user/db) or confirm you'll run the SQL in your environment and paste back the MySQL output. Once you provide the question, I will: - Explain the problem and my approach. - Provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (per your rules) labeled as an Operation when I choose to operate. - Wait for you to execute that SQL and paste the returned MySQL output, then continue iterating until we reach the final answer. I will not attempt to run mysql client here without your permission and credentials.",
