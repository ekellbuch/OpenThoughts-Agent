Please do one of the following: 1) Provide the question you want answered about the MySQL database and confirm whether you will run the SQL I produce and paste back the raw MySQL output, or 2) Provide connection details (host, port, user, database) and credentials if you want me to prepare a mysql client command to run here. Once you supply the question (and optionally connection info), I will: - Explain the approach and the SQL I'll use. - If you choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block labeled as an Operation. You will run it and return the raw MySQL output. - Iterate until we can provide the final answer. I am waiting for your question or next instruction.",
