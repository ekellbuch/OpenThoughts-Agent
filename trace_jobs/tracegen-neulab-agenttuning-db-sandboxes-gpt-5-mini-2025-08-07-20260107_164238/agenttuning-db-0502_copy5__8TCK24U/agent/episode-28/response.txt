  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB installed and running (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is installed and I verified a local socket connection as root (a prior SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-specific database query has been executed because you have not yet provided the exact question to answer. The server is accessible only from this container (TCP disabled), and the environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach. 2) Either perform one SQL operation (in the exact format you required: output 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block) which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output, or if no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array. Examples you can choose or adapt: - LIST DATABASES - SHOW TABLES FROM <database> - SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table> - SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table> If you want me to start exploratory inspection, confirm and I will run: Action: Operation\n```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n``` (one-line SQL). Tell me the exact query to run.",
