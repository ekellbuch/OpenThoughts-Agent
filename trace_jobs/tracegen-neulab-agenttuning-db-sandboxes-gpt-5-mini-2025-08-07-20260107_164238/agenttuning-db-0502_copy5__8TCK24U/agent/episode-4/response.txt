  "analysis": "You are root in the container and I installed mariadb-client and mariadb-server. The server binary (/usr/sbin/mysqld) exists and I started the server with mysqld_safe (it started with --skip-networking). The data directory /var/lib/mysql is present with system databases (mysql, performance_schema, sys). The mysql client can connect locally as root without a password via the Unix socket and returned VERSION() = 10.11.13-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.24.04.1. In short: a working MariaDB server is running, accessible from this shell via the mysql client using the Unix socket; network (TCP) connections are currently disabled because the server was started with --skip-networking.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to ask the specific SQL question you want solved. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my approach/thoughts. 2) Choose to either 'operate' (issue a single SQL statement to the database) or provide the final answer. If I operate, I will produce exactly the required operation block using the format you specified (Action: Operation plus a single SQL statement in a markdown code block with the SQL on one line). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will then parse that output and continue until we reach the final answer. Notes/considerations: - Because the server runs with --skip-networking, any SQL I send must be executed from this container (socket). - If you need remote/TCP access or to create users, I can reconfigure/restart the server without --skip-networking. - If your query involves data in a particular database, I may first run USE dbname or qualify table names. Tell me the exact question now and I will prepare the single-line SQL statement to run.",
