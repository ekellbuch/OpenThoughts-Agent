  "analysis": "The container has a running MariaDB server (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking) and the mysql client is installed. I verified the client can connect locally as root via the Unix socket (SELECT VERSION() succeeded earlier). No database-specific queries have been executed yet because you haven't provided a question. The environment is ready to run SQL from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered (for example: list databases; show tables in a particular database; SELECT rows from table WHERE condition; count rows; aggregate values; create/modify data, etc.). After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning. 2) Decide to 'Operation' (issue exactly one SQL statement) or to return the final answer. If I operate, I will produce the required block: a single-line SQL statement inside a code block preceded by 'Action: Operation' (and nothing else in that SQL block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue until we reach the final answer. Note: because the server was started with --skip-networking, all SQL must be executed from this container (socket).",
