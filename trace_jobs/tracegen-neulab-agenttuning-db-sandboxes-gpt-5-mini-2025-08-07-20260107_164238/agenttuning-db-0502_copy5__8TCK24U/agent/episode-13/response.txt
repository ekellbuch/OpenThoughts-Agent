  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and can connect locally as root via the Unix socket (a prior SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No database-specific queries have been executed because you haven't provided a question to answer. The environment is ready to run SQL from this shell against the local server.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can pick or adapt: \"LIST DATABASES\", \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\", \"COUNT rows in table users\", \"SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\", or any specific query or modification. Once you give the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a database operation is needed, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (beginning with 'Action: Operation' and followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue until we reach the final answer. If no further DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. Tell me the exact SQL question now.",
