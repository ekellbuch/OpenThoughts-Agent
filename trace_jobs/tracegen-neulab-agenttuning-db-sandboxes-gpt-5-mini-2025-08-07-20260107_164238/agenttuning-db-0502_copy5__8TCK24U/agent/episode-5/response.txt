  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd started under mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I can connect as root via the Unix socket (a previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No SQL has been executed for a user-provided question yet. I'm ready to run single SQL statements against the local server when you provide the specific question.",
  "plan": "Tell me the SQL question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, select rows matching a condition, aggregate values, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my thinking and approach. 2) Either issue one SQL statement (Action: Operation) in the exact format you required — a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block — which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output, or if no operation is needed I will return the final answer (Action: Answer) using the exact pattern. I will only include one SQL statement per operation and follow the required formatting.",
