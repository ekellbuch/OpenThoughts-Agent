  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app (prompt: root@9034de1ae209:/app#) and there are no previous commands shown. The shell startup printed: \"cannot set terminal process group\" and \"no job control\" which is common in non-interactive/container shells. No MySQL actions have been taken yet. I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running in this container, whether the mysql client is available, and whether I can connect (and with which credentials). Once I know those, I can run SQL queries you request. Nothing has been accomplished so far toward querying the database.",
  "plan": "1) Collect basic context (user, working directory, listing) to confirm environment. 2) Inspect environment variables for any MYSQL-related settings (may contain credentials). 3) Check running processes for mysqld to see if a DB server is running. 4) Check whether the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). 5) Attempt a quick non-interactive connection with mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" (this will reveal if root has no password or if the client can connect). Each command is short and intended to reveal whether and how to proceed with SQL operations. If a connection succeeds, I will then be prepared to issue the single-line SQL you request in the required markdown format on the next step.",
