I verified I can connect as root via the Unix socket (SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The server's data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No database-specific query has been run because you have not yet specified the question to answer. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell, but network/TCP access is currently disabled.",
  "plan": "I cannot run a meaningful SQL operation until you tell me the exact database question you want answered. Please provide a precise request such as one of the examples below (or your own):\n- LIST DATABASES\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\n- SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.users\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\nWhen you give the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) Either perform a single SQL operation (I will output 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block, which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output), or if no operation is needed I will return the final answer with 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array. Tell me the exact SQL question to proceed.",
