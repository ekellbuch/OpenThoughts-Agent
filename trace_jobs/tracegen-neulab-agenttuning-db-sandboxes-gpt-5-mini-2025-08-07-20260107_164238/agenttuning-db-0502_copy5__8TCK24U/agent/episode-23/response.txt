  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed in the container and mariadbd is running (started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I verified a local socket connection as root (SELECT VERSION() succeeded earlier). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-provided database question has been executed yet — you have not specified which query or information you want from the database. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can pick or adapt: \"LIST DATABASES\", \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>\", \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>\", \"COUNT rows in <database>.<table>\", \"SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>\", or any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Once you provide the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, output exactly one operation in the format you specified: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (and nothing else in that SQL block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed and I'm ready to return results, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"...\"]' exactly in the pattern you specified.",
