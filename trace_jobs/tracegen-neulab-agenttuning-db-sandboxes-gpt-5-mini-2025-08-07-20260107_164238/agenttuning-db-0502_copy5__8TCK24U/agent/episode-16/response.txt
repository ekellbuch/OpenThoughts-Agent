  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB installed and running (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I have verified I can connect as root via the local Unix socket (a previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-provided database question has been run yet — you haven't specified which data or query you want executed. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell, but network/TCP connections are disabled because the server was started with --skip-networking.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can give (pick one or adapt):\n- \"LIST DATABASES\"\n- \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\"\n- \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\"\n- \"COUNT rows in table users\"\n- \"SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\"\n- Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you require\n\nOnce you provide the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning (my thoughts). 2) If an operation is required, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the format you requested: I will output the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (and nothing else in that SQL block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will then parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed and I'm ready to return the final result, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"...\"]' exactly in the pattern you specified.\n\nNotes: because the server runs with --skip-networking, any SQL must be executed from this container (socket). If you want me to enable TCP access or create users, mention that and I will proceed accordingly.",
