The mysql client is installed and I confirmed a local socket connection as root (SELECT VERSION() succeeded previously). The data dir (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-specified database query has been executed because you haven't provided the question to answer. The server is accessible only from this container (TCP disabled).",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me the exact database question you want answered. Please specify precisely what you want (examples: \"LIST DATABASES\", \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\", \"COUNT rows in mydb.users\", \"SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\", or any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) Either perform one SQL operation (I'll output 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block as you required) or, if no DB operation is needed, return the final answer with 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array. For example, if you want me to begin exploration I can run: Action: Operation\n```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n``` (one-line SQL). Tell me which query to run.",
