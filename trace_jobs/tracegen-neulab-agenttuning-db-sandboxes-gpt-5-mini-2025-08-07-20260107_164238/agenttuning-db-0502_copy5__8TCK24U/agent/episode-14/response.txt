  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I confirmed a local socket connection as root (SELECT VERSION() succeeded earlier). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No database-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided a question yet. The environment is ready to run SQL from this shell, but network access is disabled (server started with --skip-networking), so all SQL must be executed locally from this container.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can provide or adapt: - \"LIST DATABASES\" - \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\" - \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\" - \"COUNT rows in table users\" - \"SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\" - any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you need. Once you give the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a database operation is required, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (beginning with the line 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed and I'm ready to return the final result, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"...\"]' exactly in the pattern you specified. Tell me the exact question to proceed.",
