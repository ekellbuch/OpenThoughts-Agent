The mysql client is installed and can connect as root via the local Unix socket (a prior SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No database-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet provided a question. The environment is ready to run SQL from this shell against the local server.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database question you want answered (examples: list databases; show tables in a specific database; SELECT rows from a table with a condition; count rows; aggregate values; etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and approach. 2) If an operation is required, emit exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute only that first SQL block and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern. Please tell me the exact question now.",
