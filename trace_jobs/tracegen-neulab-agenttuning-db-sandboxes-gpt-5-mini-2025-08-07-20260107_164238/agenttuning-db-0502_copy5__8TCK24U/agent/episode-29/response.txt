  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in this container (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is installed and I confirmed a local socket connection as root earlier (a previous SELECT VERSION() returned the server version). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-provided database query has been executed because you have not yet specified which question or SQL to run. The server currently accepts only local socket connections (TCP is disabled). The environment is ready to run SQL statements locally from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can pick or adapt: - LIST DATABASES - SHOW TABLES FROM <database> - SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table> - SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table> - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE\n\nOnce you provide the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement in the format you mandated: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (and nothing else in that SQL block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed and I'm ready to return results, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"...\"]' exactly in the pattern you specified.\n\nIf you want me to start with a safe exploratory query, confirm and I will run: Action: Operation\n```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n```",
