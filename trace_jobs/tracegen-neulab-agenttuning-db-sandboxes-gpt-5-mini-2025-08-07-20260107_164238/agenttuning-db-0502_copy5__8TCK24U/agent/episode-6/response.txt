  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and connecting as root via the Unix socket works (SELECT VERSION() succeeded earlier). No database-specific query has been run because you haven't provided the question yet. I'm ready to run SQL against this local server.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact question you want answered about the database (examples: list databases; show tables in a specific database; SELECT rows from a table with a condition; aggregate/query results). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and approach. 2) Choose to 'Operation' (emit exactly one SQL statement in the required format) or 'Answer' if no DB operation is needed. If I operate, I will put a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block as you required (and only that SQL will be executed). After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
