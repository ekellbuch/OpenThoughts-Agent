  "analysis": "We installed the MariaDB client successfully, but there's no running MySQL/MariaDB server in the container (mysql client returns socket error). No MySQL-related environment variables were found earlier. To run SQL statements I need an accessible server: either an existing local server (socket or TCP), remote host credentials, or to start a local server. Currently none exists, so we must locate any existing data directories or server binary, or install and start a MariaDB server in this container.",
  "plan": "1) Look for any MySQL/MariaDB-related environment variables or files (to see if a server exists elsewhere or data directory is present). 2) Check for existing server binaries and the mysql data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and config (/etc/mysql). 3) If no server is present, install and start mariadb-server (or initialize a datadir and run mysqld) so we can connect with the mysql client. I'll probe filesystem and binaries first, then install and start the server if necessary.",
