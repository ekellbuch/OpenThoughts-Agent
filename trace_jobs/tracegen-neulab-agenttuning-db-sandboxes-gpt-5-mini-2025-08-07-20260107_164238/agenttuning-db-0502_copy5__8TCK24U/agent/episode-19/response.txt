  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB installed and running (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is installed and I have verified a local socket connection as root (a prior SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No database-specific query has been executed because you have not provided a question to answer. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell; network/TCP access is currently disabled because the server was started with --skip-networking.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can pick or adapt:  - LIST DATABASES  - SHOW TABLES FROM <database>  - SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>  - COUNT rows in <database>.<table>  - SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>  - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you require Once you give the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed and I'm ready to give the final result, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"...\"]' exactly in the pattern you specified. Note: because the server currently runs with --skip-networking, any SQL must be executed from this container (socket). If you want TCP access enabled or a specific user created, tell me and I will perform those steps before running queries.",
