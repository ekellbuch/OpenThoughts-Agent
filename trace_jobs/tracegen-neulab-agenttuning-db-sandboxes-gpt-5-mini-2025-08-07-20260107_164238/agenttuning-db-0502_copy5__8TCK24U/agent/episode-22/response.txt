  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in this container (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I can connect as root via the Unix socket (a previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No database-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided a question to answer. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell; network/TCP access is currently disabled because the server was started with --skip-networking.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can give or adapt:  - \"LIST DATABASES\"  - \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>\"  - \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>\"  - \"COUNT rows in <database>.<table>\"  - \"SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>\"  - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you require Once you provide the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a database operation is required, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the format you specified (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you want, I can start by listing databases (I will only do that after you confirm).",
