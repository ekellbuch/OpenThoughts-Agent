  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB installed and the server is running (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and a local socket connection as root works (previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No database-specific query has been run because you have not provided a question. The environment is ready to accept SQL from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered (examples: \"list databases\"; \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\"; \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\"; \"COUNT rows in table X\"; or a modification like INSERT/UPDATE). Once you give the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If an operation is needed, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (and nothing else in that SQL block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If instead I'm ready to give the final answer without further DB operations, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"...\"]' exactly in the format you specified. Please tell me the exact database question now (or pick one of the example prompts).",
