  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB server installed and running (mariadbd was started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is installed and a local socket connection as root works (a previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases (mysql, performance_schema, sys) exist. No database-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet specified the question or the data you want retrieved/modified. The server is accessible only from this container (TCP disabled), and I'm ready to run single SQL statements from here when you provide the exact question.",
  "plan": "Tell me the exact database question you want answered (examples: \"LIST DATABASES\", \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\", \"COUNT rows in mydb.users\", \"SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.table\", or any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning. 2) If an operation is needed, produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (beginning with the line 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only that SQL block and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse the output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If you prefer, I can start by running a safe exploratory query such as SHOW DATABASES; tell me to proceed or give the specific query you want.",
