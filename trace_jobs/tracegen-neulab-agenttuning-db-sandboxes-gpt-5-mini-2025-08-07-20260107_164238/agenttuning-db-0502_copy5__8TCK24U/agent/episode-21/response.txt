The mysql client is installed and can connect locally as root via the Unix socket (a prior SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-provided database query has been executed because you have not yet specified the question to answer. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell (TCP is currently disabled).",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can give or adapt: - LIST DATABASES - SHOW TABLES FROM <database> - SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> - COUNT rows in <database>.<table> - SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table> - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE If you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (only that SQL will be executed). You will run that one SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is required I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. Tell me the exact question now.",
