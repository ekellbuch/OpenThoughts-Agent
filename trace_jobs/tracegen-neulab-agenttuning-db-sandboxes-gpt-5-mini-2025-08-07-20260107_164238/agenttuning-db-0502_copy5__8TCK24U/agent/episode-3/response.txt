To run SQL queries we must install and start a database server in this container. Nothing has yet been queried on the database because there is no running server.",
  "plan": "1) Install the MariaDB server package (mariadb-server) using apt (noninteractive). 2) Verify the mysqld binary is present and check /var/lib/mysql. 3) Start the MariaDB server using the service script (or fallback to mysqld_safe if needed). 4) Verify mysqld is running (ps). 5) Try a non-interactive connection with the mysql client as root to confirm we can run SQL. If successful, we'll be ready to execute the single-line SQL you request next.",
