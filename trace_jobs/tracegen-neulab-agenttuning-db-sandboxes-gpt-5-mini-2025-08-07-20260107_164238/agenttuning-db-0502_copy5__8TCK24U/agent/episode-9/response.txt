The mysql client is available and can connect as root via the local Unix socket (previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No database-specific queries have been executed because you haven't provided a question yet. The environment is ready for SQL operations from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered (examples: list databases; show tables in a specific database; SELECT rows with a condition; count or aggregate values; modify data). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (thoughts). 2) Choose to either 'Operation' (produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format) or 'Answer' (final answer). If I operate, I will emit a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block as you required; you will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output, which I will parse and continue until we reach the final answer.",
