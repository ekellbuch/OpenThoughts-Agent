The mysql client is installed and can connect as root via the local Unix socket (previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No database-specific queries have been executed because you haven't provided the question yet. The environment is ready to run SQL from this shell against the local server.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact question you want answered about the database (for example: list databases; show tables from a specific database; SELECT rows from a table with a condition; aggregate values, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and outline the SQL needed. 2) If I need to run SQL, I will emit a single operation in the exact format you required (Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement on a single line inside a markdown code block). You will execute only that first SQL block and return its raw MySQL output, which I will parse and continue until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern. Tell me the specific question now.",
