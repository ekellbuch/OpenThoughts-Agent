  "analysis": "You are root in /app inside a minimal container. There is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found) and there is no MySQL/MariaDB server process running. No environment variables with MySQL credentials were present. To run SQL I need a MySQL client (or another client compatible with the server). Currently nothing has been changed — no DB operations have been performed yet.",
  "plan": "1) Detect which package manager is available (apt-get, apt, apk, or yum). 2) Use a single conditional command to install a MariaDB/MySQL client appropriate for the distro: for Debian/Ubuntu use apt-get to install mariadb-client; for Alpine use apk; for CentOS/RHEL use yum. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed with mysql --version. 4) Attempt a quick non-interactive connection to localhost as root to test connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\". This will tell us whether a server is available and whether root has no password. Based on the outputs, we'll know how to proceed to issue the SQL statement you want.",
