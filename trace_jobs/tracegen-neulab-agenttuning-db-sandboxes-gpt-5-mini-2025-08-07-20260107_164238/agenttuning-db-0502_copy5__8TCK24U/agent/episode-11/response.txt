  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB server installed and running (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is installed and I verified a local connection as root via the Unix socket (SELECT VERSION() succeeded). No database-specific queries have been run because you have not yet provided a question. The environment is ready to run SQL from this shell against the local server.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples: \"list databases\", \"show tables in database X\", \"SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition\", \"count rows in table Y\", or any other specific query or modification. After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning (my thoughts). 2) If a database operation is required, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output. I will then parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach a final answer. If no operation is needed and I'm ready to return the final result, I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]' exactly in the pattern you specified. Important reminders: - The SQL I provide will be a single statement on one line inside a markdown code block. - I will issue only one SQL statement per round. - Because the server currently runs with --skip-networking, any SQL must be executed from this container (socket). Please tell me the exact question now.",
