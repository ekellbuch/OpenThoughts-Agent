  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I previously verified a local socket connection as root (SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No database-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided the exact question you want answered. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell; network/TCP access is currently disabled.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can pick or adapt:  - LIST DATABASES  - SHOW TABLES FROM <database>  - SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>  - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>  - SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>  - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE Once you provide the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the format you required (beginning with the line \"Action: Operation\" and followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern. If you want me to start exploratory inspection now, say so (I will run SHOW DATABASES; as a single SQL statement).",
