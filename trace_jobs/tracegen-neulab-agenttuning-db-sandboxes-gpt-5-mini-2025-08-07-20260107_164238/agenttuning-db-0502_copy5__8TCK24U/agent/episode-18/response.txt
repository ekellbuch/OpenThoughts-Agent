  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB server installed and running (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I verified a local socket connection as root earlier (SELECT VERSION() returned the server version). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-provided database question has been executed because you have not specified what to query. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell, but network/TCP connections are currently disabled because the server was started with --skip-networking.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can pick or adapt: - LIST DATABASES - SHOW TABLES FROM <database> - SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> - COUNT rows in <database>.<table> - SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table> - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you require Once you give the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. Note: because the server runs with --skip-networking, any SQL must be executed from this container (socket). If you want TCP enabled or a specific user created, tell me and I will perform those steps.",
