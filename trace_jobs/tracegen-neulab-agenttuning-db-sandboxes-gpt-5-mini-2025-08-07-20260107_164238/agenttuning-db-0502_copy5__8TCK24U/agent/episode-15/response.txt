  "analysis": "The container now has MariaDB server installed and running (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is installed and a local socket connection as root works (previous SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases (mysql, performance_schema, sys) exist. No database-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided a question to answer. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell.",
  "plan": "Please provide the exact database question you want answered (examples: \"LIST DATABASES\", \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5\", \"COUNT rows in table users\", \"SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\", or any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, output exactly one operation in the format you specified (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by one SQL statement on a single line inside a markdown code block). You will execute only that first SQL code block and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
