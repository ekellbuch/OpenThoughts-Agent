  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I verified a local socket connection as root (SELECT VERSION() succeeded earlier). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No user-specific database query has been executed because you have not provided a question yet. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell (TCP is currently disabled).",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can ask (pick or adapt):\n- LIST DATABASES\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>\n- COUNT rows in <database>.<table>\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>\n\nWhen you give the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you want me to enable TCP access or create users, say so and I will proceed.",
