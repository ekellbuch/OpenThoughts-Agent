  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd launched via mysqld_safe with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and I verified a local socket connection as root earlier (SELECT VERSION() returned the server version). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and system databases exist. No database-specific query has been executed because you have not provided a question yet. The environment is ready to run SQL locally from this shell, but network/TCP access is currently disabled because the server was started with --skip-networking.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can give or adapt: \"LIST DATABASES\", \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>\", \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>\", \"COUNT rows in <database>.<table>\", \"SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>\", or any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. After you provide the exact question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach (my thoughts). 2) If a DB operation is required, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (and nothing else in that SQL block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and continue iteratively until we reach the final answer. If no DB operation is needed I will return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
