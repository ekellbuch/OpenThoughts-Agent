  "analysis": "We are root in /app. The container does not have a MySQL server or client installed: /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist, no mysql/mariadb processes are running, mysql client is not found, and ss is not available. No relevant environment variables pointing to a database were found. In short: no local MySQL server and no client to connect currently. To run SQL we must either install a client here or connect from elsewhere to an existing DB (you must provide host/port/user/password/database).",
  "plan": "1) Detect the OS/distribution so we know which package manager to use. 2) Attempt to install a MySQL-compatible client (try apt, apk, yum/dnf as available) in a single conditional command. 3) Verify the mysql client is now available. After that I'll ask you for the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the SQL question to answer. If you prefer, instead of installing a client here you can provide a remote connection string and I'll craft the SQL to run.",
