  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside /app (prompt: root@7acd44c38dfb:/app#). No MySQL commands have been run yet and there is no database output shown. We need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server or client is available in this container, any credentials or environment variables pointing to a database, and whether a local socket or TCP port (3306) is open. Once we know how to connect, you (the user) will provide the SQL question to answer or I will issue a targeted SQL statement. Right now nothing has been accomplished toward querying MySQL.",
  "plan": "I will inspect the environment and filesystem for MySQL artifacts, check running processes and listening ports, and check for mysql client availability and related environment variables. Steps and expectations:\n1) whoami, pwd, ls -la to confirm current user and working directory.\n2) Check common MySQL directories (/var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld) to see if a server is installed and where sockets/data live.\n3) Inspect running processes for mysql or mariadb to see if server is running and under what user.\n4) Look for environment variables mentioning MYSQL, MARIADB, DB, or credentials.\n5) Check for mysql client binary and its version.\n6) Check listening TCP ports (3306) to see if a MySQL server is accessible via TCP.\nAfter these discovery commands, I'll report results and propose the next command to connect and run SQL. I will not run any SQL until you either provide the question or I confirm connection details. Each shell command below will be executed in sequence to gather the above information.",
