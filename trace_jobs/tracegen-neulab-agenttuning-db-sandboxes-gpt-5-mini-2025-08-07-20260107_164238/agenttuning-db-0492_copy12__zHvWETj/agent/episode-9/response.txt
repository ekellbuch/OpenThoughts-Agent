  "analysis": "You are in a container where I installed the mysql client (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server running, /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql server config were absent, /app is empty, and no database dumps or credential files were found on the filesystem. Without a running server, a dump file, or connection credentials, I cannot run any SQL to answer a database question.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of the following three options and provide the necessary details so I can proceed. After you provide details I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (2) present exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (per your rule) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\n1) Connect to a running MySQL server (recommended)\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or tell me you'll provide a ~/.my.cnf), and optionally a database name. Also provide the question you want answered (e.g., \"List users with more than 5 orders\").\n   - Example client usage I will use (not executed yet): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\"\n   - Note: If the password contains special characters, wrap it in single quotes and be careful about shell quoting.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or database file inside the container\n   - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file inside the container, and the question to answer.\n   - If needed, I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3) to inspect it. I will explain the one-line SQL (or tool command) to run against that file.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in the container\n   - Tell me you want this and provide a desired root password and any user/database to create.\n   - This requires more steps (installing mysql-server, initializing, starting the service). I will then run SQL locally and iterate per your protocol.\n\nAfter you pick an option and provide details, I will:\n- Explain the exact SQL statement I plan to run and why.\n- Output a single one-line SQL statement inside a single SQL code block (this is the only SQL you must execute this round).\n- You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back here.\n\nSecurity note: If you're sharing credentials, be careful. If you prefer, create a read-only user for this task and share those credentials instead of the root password.\n\nWhich option do you choose, and please supply the required details (connection info or file path) and the database question to answer?",
