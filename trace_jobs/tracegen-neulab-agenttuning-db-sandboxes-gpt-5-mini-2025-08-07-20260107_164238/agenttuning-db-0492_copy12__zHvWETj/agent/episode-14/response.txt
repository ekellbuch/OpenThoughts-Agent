  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed and verified at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql or server config beyond the client's fallback), /app is empty, and no .env, dumps, or credential files were found on the filesystem. Without either (A) connection credentials for a running MySQL server, (B) a path to a local dump/database file, or (C) explicit permission to install and start a local MySQL server here, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database or answer database-related questions.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the three options you want to proceed with and provide the requested details:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered. I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only that first SQL block and paste back the raw output.\n\nOption 2 — Inspect a local dump or database file inside the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If tools are missing (gunzip, sqlite3) I can install them. I will explain the command/SQL I will run and then present one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create requested users/databases, and then run SQL. This takes longer and is more invasive. I will still provide one SQL statement per round.\n\nOnce you choose an option and provide the required details (connection info or file path and the specific question), I'll (a) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (b) provide the single-line SQL statement in the required SQL code block format for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
