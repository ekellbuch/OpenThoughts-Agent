  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql data dir), /etc/mysql only contains the client's fallback, /app is empty, and a filesystem search found no .env, SQL dump, or credential files to use. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database: you have not provided (A) remote MySQL connection credentials, (B) the path to a local dump/database file, nor (C) explicit permission and details to install and run a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three options so I can proceed and then provide the required details. Once you provide details I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (2) output exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. Options:\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended)\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (defaults to 3306 if omitted), username, password (or note that you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container\n   - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If a tool is missing (e.g., sqlite3, gunzip) I can install it first.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in this container\n   - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any user/database to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nSecurity note: If sharing credentials, consider creating and sharing a read-only user. If you choose a remote connection and the password contains shell-special characters, put it in single quotes when running the mysql client command.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the necessary details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question), or explicitly authorize installing a local server and give the root password and any initial DB/user info. After that I will prepare the SQL operation (explain it and provide the single-line SQL block) for you to execute.",
