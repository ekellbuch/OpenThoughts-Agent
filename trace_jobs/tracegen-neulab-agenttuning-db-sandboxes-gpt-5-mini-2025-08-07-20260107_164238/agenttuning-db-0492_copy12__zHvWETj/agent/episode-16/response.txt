  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and verified. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no server config beyond the client's fallback) and /app is empty. A filesystem search found no .env, dump, or credential files to connect to a database. Without a running server, remote connection credentials, or a local dump/database file, I cannot run any SQL or answer a database query.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose one of these three options and provide the required details:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or tell me you'll use a ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered. I will explain the SQL I'll run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only that SQL block and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption 2 — Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container:\n  - Provide the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If a required tool (gunzip, sqlite3) is missing I can install it. I will explain the command/SQL I'll run and then present one single-line SQL statement or appropriate single command for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This is more invasive and takes longer, but is possible.\n\nWhen you provide one of the above (connection details or file path or permission to install a local server) and the specific question to answer, I will: (a) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (b) output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and return the raw output. If you want me to proceed with installing a local server now, say so and give the desired root password and any initial DB/user details.",
