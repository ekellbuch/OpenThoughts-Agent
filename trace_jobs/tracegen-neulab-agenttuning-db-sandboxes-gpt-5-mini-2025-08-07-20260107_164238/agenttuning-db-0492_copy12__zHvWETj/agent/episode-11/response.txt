  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql), /app is empty, and no credential or dump files were found. I cannot execute any SQL because there is no target database: no running server, no remote connection info, and no local dump or DB file to inspect. I've prepared the environment to run SQL once you provide the target (remote server credentials, path to a dump/DB file, or instruction to install/run a local server).",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you pick one of these options and provide details:\n\n1) Connect to a running MySQL server you control: provide host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or tell me you will provide a ~/.my.cnf), and optionally the database name, plus the exact question to answer. I will then explain the SQL I'll run and provide a single-line SQL statement in the required format for you (the first SQL block will be executed).\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container: provide the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question you want answered. If needed I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3). I will explain what I will run and provide the one-line SQL/command to execute.\n\n3) Install and start a local MySQL server in this container: tell me to proceed and provide the desired root password and any user/database to create. I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, and then run queries (this takes more steps).\n\nWhen you reply with the chosen option and the required details, I will (a) explain my approach and the exact SQL I will run, and (b) output exactly one SQL statement inside a single-line SQL code block (no extra text inside that block), which you must execute and paste back the raw MySQL output for me to parse.",
