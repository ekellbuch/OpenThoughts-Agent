  "analysis": "Summary: The mysql client is installed and verified at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql data dir, no /etc/mysql server config beyond the client's fallback), /app is empty, and no credential or SQL dump files were found on the filesystem. Without a running server, a database dump, or connection credentials for a remote server, I cannot run any SQL statements or answer database queries yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit for 3306), username, password (or say you'll provide a ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n  - After you provide this, I will (1) explain the SQL I'll run and why, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation). You will run that SQL with the mysql client and paste the raw output back to me.\n\nOption B — Inspect a local dump or DB file in the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer.\n  - If a tool is missing (e.g., sqlite3, gunzip), I can install it. I will explain the command or SQL I will run, then give one SQL statement or a single command (per your rules) for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption C — Install and run a local MySQL server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to proceed and provide the desired root password (and any initial user/database to create).\n  - If you confirm, I will install mysql-server non-interactively, start it, create any requested user/database, and then run SQL as you request. This is more invasive and takes longer; I will still follow your rule of producing one SQL statement per round.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide the required details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question), or explicitly authorize me to install and start a local server and give the desired root password. Once you do, I will explain the SQL to run and present the single-line SQL code block for you to execute.",
