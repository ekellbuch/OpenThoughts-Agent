Python3 exists but sqlite3 is not installed. apt-get is available on this Ubuntu 24.04 container, so we can install a MySQL client to run SQL statements against a remote server (if you provide connection details) or a locally-started server (if you plan to install and run one).",

Steps: 1) Update apt package lists. 2) Install the default-mysql-client package (provides the mysql client). 3) Verify the mysql client is available by checking its version. After that, I'll be able to run single-line SQL commands you provide (using mysql -u ... -e \"SQL...\").",
