  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql data dir), /etc/mysql only contains the client's fallback, /app is empty, and no .env, dump, or credential files were found. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database (no running server, no dump, no connection credentials).",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of three options so I can proceed and then provide the required details. After you provide them I will (a) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (b) output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended)\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you'll use ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question to answer.\n   - Example I will run (not executed until you confirm): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\"\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container\n   - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file inside the container and the question to answer. If tools (gunzip, sqlite3) are missing I can install them.\n   - I will explain and present one command/SQL statement for you to run that inspects the file.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in the container\n   - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password and any initial user/database to create.\n   - I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/dbs, and then run queries. This is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nSecurity note: If sharing credentials, consider creating a read-only user for this task. When you give credentials, ensure you understand they will be used in the mysql client command; if the password contains special shell characters, wrap it in single quotes.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the necessary details (connection info or file path and the exact question), or explicitly authorize installing a local server with the desired root password. Once you do, I will explain the SQL I'll run and provide the single-line SQL code block for you to execute.",
