  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and verified. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql data directory, no server config beyond the client's fallback in /etc/mysql), /app is empty, and no .env, dump, or credential files were found anywhere on the filesystem. I cannot execute any SQL because I have no target database: no running local server, no remote connection credentials, and no local SQL dump or DB file to inspect. You've not provided a question to answer or any connection/file details.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you choose how to proceed and give the necessary details. Pick one of these options and provide the requested information:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n  - After you provide this, I will: (a) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (b) output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only that first SQL block and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption 2 — Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If a tool is missing (e.g., sqlite3, gunzip) I can install it.\n  - I will explain the command/SQL I will run and then present one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial users/databases to create).\n  - I will install mysql-server non-interactively, initialize and start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This takes longer and is more invasive; I will still provide one SQL statement per round.\n\nWhen you reply, include which option you choose and the required details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question). Once you provide that, I will (1) explain the SQL I plan to run and why, and (2) output exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and paste the raw output back here.",
