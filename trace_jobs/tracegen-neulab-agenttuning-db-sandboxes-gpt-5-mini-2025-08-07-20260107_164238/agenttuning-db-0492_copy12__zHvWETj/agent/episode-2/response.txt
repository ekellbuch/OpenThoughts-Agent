  "analysis": "So far: the container lacks a mysql client (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, and /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist. /app is empty. I attempted a simple SELECT but couldn't because mysql client/server are not present. At this point there is no local MySQL server to query and no obvious SQL dumps in /app. What remains is to search the filesystem for any database dumps, configuration files (like my.cnf or .my.cnf) that may contain credentials, socket files that could indicate a running server, or other DB files (sqlite, .db, .sql.gz). If none are found, the next steps would be to either install a MySQL client (if allowed) or ask you to provide connection details for a remote database.",
  "plan": "1) List the root home to see if a .my.cnf or other credentials exist. 2) Inspect /root/.my.cnf if present. 3) Run a controlled filesystem search (pruning /proc,/sys,/dev) for common DB/dump/config files: my.cnf, .my.cnf, *.sql, *.sql.gz, *.db, *.sqlite, *.csv. This will reveal any local dumps or credentials. 4) Search for socket files (*.sock) which can indicate a local server. 5) Print environment variables (first 200 lines) to look for DB-related variables. 6) Check /etc/os-release and whether apt-get exists, so we can decide whether to install a client if necessary. Each command is quick except the filesystem search which may take longer; durations reflect that.",
