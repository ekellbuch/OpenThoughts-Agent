  "analysis": "You are in a container where the mysql client has been installed and verified (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql) and no database dumps, .env, or credential files were found on the filesystem. Without either (A) remote MySQL connection credentials, (B) a local dump/database file path, or (C) explicit permission to install and run a local MySQL server here, I cannot execute any SQL or answer a database question.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the three options below you choose and provide the required details. After you provide the details I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (2) output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended)\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container\n   - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If a tool is missing (gunzip, sqlite3) I can install it.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in this container\n   - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, and then run SQL. This is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nIf you’re unsure, I recommend option 1 (remote server) with a read-only user for safety. Once you provide your choice and the necessary details (connection info or file path and the exact question), I will prepare the single SQL statement to run and explain it.",
