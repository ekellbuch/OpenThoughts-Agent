  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed at /usr/bin/mysql and verified. There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql data dir, no /etc/mysql server config beyond the client's fallback). /app is empty and no .env, SQL dump, or credential files were found on the filesystem. I cannot execute any SQL because there is no target database: you have not provided remote connection credentials, a path to a local dump/database file, nor permission to install and run a local MySQL server in this environment.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three ways to proceed and provide the required details:\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll supply ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question to answer. I will then explain the SQL I will run and present exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only the first SQL block I provide and paste back the raw mysql output.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container: provide the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If needed I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3). I will explain the command/SQL I will run and then present one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute and return the output.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in this container: confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial users/databases to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and the necessary details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question). After that I will (a) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (b) provide the single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and return the raw output.",
