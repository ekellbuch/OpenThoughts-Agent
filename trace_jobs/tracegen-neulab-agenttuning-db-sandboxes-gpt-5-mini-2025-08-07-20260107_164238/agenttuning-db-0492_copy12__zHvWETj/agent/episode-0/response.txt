  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app inside a container. No MySQL commands have been run yet and there is no information about a running MySQL server or available credentials. The terminal shows no job control messages but is otherwise idle. We need to discover whether a MySQL server and client are present, whether the server is running, and whether we can connect (and how) before executing any SQL to answer questions about the database.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the MySQL client is available (mysql --version). 2) Look for a running mysqld process to see if a server is running. 3) Inspect the typical data directory (/var/lib/mysql) to see if database files exist. 4) Attempt a non-interactive connection as root to run a simple test query (SELECT VERSION()) using mysql -u root -e to avoid interactive password prompts. If that fails, we'll inspect environment variables (e.g., MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD) and other likely credential locations and then attempt other connection methods. Each command is chosen to be fast and to reveal whether and how we can operate the database.",
