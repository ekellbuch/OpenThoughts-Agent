  "analysis": "Current state: The mysql client is installed and working at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql), /app is empty, and no .env, dump, or credential files were found anywhere on the filesystem. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database: you have not provided remote connection credentials, a path to a local dump/database file, nor permission to install and run a local MySQL server here.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three ways to proceed and provide the required details so I can run SQL and answer your question:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n  - I will explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only that first SQL block and paste the raw mysql output back to me.\n\nOption 2 — Inspect a local dump or DB file in the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If a tool (gunzip, sqlite3) is missing I can install it.\n  - I will explain the command/SQL I'll run and then present one single-line SQL statement or single command for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create).\n  - I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This takes longer and is more invasive. I will still provide one SQL statement per round.\n\nAdditional notes: When I provide an SQL operation round I will (a) explain the intent and the exact SQL, and (b) include exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (no other text inside the block). You must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me so I can parse it and continue. If you share credentials, consider using a read-only user for safety.",
