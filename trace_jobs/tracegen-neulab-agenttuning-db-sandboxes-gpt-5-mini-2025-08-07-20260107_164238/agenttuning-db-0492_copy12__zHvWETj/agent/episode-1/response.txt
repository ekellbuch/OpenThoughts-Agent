  "analysis": "Current state: There is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. We're in /app inside the container. At this point we cannot execute SQL against a MySQL server because neither client nor server is present or available. What remains: locate any database files or SQL dumps in the filesystem (especially under /app), discover any environment variables or .env files that might contain connection information for an external database, and check for alternative clients (mariadb, mysqladmin) or local DBs (sqlite) we could use instead. If no database files or connection info are present, we may need to install a MySQL client (if allowed) or request credentials/connection details from you.",
  "plan": "1) List files under /app to see the project contents and find possible database dumps or .env files. 2) Use find to look for files with database-related extensions (.sql, .sql.gz, .db, .sqlite, .csv) within /app. 3) Check common MySQL configuration and socket directories (/etc/mysql and /var/run/mysqld) to see if a server is present. 4) Print environment variables related to MySQL to find credentials or host info. 5) Check for alternative client binaries (mariadb, mysqladmin) and for sqlite3 and python3 availability so we know other ways to query data. 6) If we find a dump or DB file, we'll inspect it (next steps would be to run appropriate SQL or use sqlite3). Each command is intended to be quick and informative.",
