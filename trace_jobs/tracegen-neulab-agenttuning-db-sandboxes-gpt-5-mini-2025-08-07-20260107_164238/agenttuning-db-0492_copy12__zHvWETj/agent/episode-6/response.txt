  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client in the container and verified it is available at /usr/bin/mysql. There is still no local MySQL server or database files present (/var/lib/mysql and related dirs were absent). At this point I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database to connect to and no SQL dump to inspect.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the question you want answered and the target database details. There are three common options:\n- Connect to a running MySQL server: provide host, port (default 3306), username, and password (or indicate an auth method). I will run one SQL statement per round using the mysql client (mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SQL...\").\n- Inspect a local SQL dump file: provide the path to a .sql or .sql.gz file in the container, and I will run a command to view or import it (you must grant permission to import into a server or to inspect contents).\n- Inspect a local database file (e.g., sqlite): provide the file path; if sqlite3 is needed I can install it.\n\nWhen you give me the connection info or a dump path and the question, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I will run, then (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format. Remember: every operation round you must execute only the first SQL code block I provide; I will provide the SQL in one line inside a markdown code block. When finished and sure of the results I will output the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.\n\nIf you want me to attempt a connection now, please reply with the question plus either the connection credentials (host, port, user, password) or the path to a local dump/database file. If you prefer, I can also install additional clients (e.g., sqlite3) — tell me which option to proceed with.",
