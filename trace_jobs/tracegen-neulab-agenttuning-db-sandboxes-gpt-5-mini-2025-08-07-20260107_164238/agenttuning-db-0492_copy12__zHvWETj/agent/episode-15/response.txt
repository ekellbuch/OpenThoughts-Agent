  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and verified. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no server config), /app is empty, and no .env, dump, or credential files were found on the filesystem. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database: no running server, no remote connection info, and no local dump/database file.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of three options and supply the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n  - I will explain the SQL I will run and then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nOption B — Inspect a local dump or DB file in the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If tools are missing (gunzip, sqlite3) I can install them.\n  - I will explain the command/SQL I will run and then present one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption C — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create).\n  - I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create any requested user/database, and then run SQL. This is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nAfter you choose an option and provide the needed details (connection credentials or file path plus the exact question), I will: (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (2) present exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and paste back the raw output. When ready, tell me which option you choose and give the details.",
