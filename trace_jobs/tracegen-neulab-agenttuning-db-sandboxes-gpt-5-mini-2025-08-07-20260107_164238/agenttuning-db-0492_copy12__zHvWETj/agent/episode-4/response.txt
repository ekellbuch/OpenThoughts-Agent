  "analysis": "mysql client is now installed (mysql 8.0.44). Previously there was no MySQL server, no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, and no mysql client. /app is empty and there were no obvious environment variables for DB connection. With the client available we can now search the filesystem for database dumps, configuration files, or credentials (e.g., .env, my.cnf, .my.cnf, SQL dumps) or any socket/port that might indicate a running server. If we find connection info or a dump, we can run a single SQL statement (per your rules) to inspect data. At present there is still no target database to query until we locate credentials, a dump, or a running server.",
  "plan": "1) Search the filesystem (excluding /proc,/sys,/dev,/run,/var/lib/docker) for common files: .env, *.env, my.cnf, .my.cnf, *.sql, *.sql.gz, *.db, *.sqlite, *.csv. This will find dumps or config files. 2) Grep the filesystem for the string 'mysql' (case-insensitive) to find configuration or connection strings. 3) Inspect /etc/mysql/my.cnf (the package created a fallback) if present. 4) Check for any listening service on port 3306 (local MySQL default). Based on results, we'll either run a SQL statement against a discovered server or inspect a dump file. Each command is chosen to be informative and relatively quick; the filesystem search may take longer so I allow more time for it.",
