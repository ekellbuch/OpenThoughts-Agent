  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and verified at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql, no server config beyond the client's fallback), /app is empty, and there are no .env, dump, or credential files on the filesystem. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database: you have not provided remote connection credentials, a path to a local dump/database file, nor permission to install and run a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed and provide the necessary details. Pick one of the options below and supply the required information; after that I will explain the SQL I'll run and present exactly one SQL statement (per your rules) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption 1 — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll use a ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered. \n  - After you provide these, I'll describe the SQL to run and then output one single-line SQL statement in the required format. Example client command I would use: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SQL\"\n\nOption 2 — Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If a tool is missing (gunzip, sqlite3) I can install it. \n  - I'll explain the extraction/SQL and provide one single-line SQL or command for you to run.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide the desired root password (and any initial user/database to create). \n  - I'll install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This is more invasive and takes longer; I will still follow the one-SQL-per-round rule.\n\nWhen you reply, include which option you choose and supply the requested details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question). If you want me to proceed now with installation of a local server, say so and provide the root password and any initial DB/user details.",
