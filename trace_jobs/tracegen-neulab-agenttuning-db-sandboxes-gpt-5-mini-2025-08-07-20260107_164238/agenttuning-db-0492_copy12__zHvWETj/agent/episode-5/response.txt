  "analysis": "Summary of current state: The container initially had no MySQL client or server and no database files. I installed the MySQL client (default-mysql-client). There is still no MySQL server running and no database dumps or env files with DB credentials were found on the filesystem. /app is empty. Without connection details (host, port, user, password) or a local database file/dump, I cannot run SQL to answer questions about a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will (1) confirm the mysql client binary location and show the top of the mysql help output so you can see the client is available and how we would pass connection parameters; then (2) wait for you to either provide the SQL question and/or database connection details (host, port, user, password, or a SQL dump file). Once you provide a target (a running server or a dump), I'll run one SQL statement per your protocol and process the results. If you want me to attempt connecting to a specific server now, give me the connection info and the SQL you'd like to run.",
