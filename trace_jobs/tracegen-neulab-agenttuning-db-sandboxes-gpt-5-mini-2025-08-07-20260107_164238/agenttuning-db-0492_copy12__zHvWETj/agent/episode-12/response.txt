  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server or database files in the container (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql server config are absent, /app is empty), and no credential or dump files were found. Without either (A) connection credentials for a running MySQL server, (B) a path to a local dump/database file in the container, or (C) an instruction to install and configure a local server, I cannot run any SQL statements or answer database questions.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three options so I can proceed:\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server you control — provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll provide a .my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered. I will then explain the SQL I will run and output exactly one SQL statement (in the required single-line SQL code block) for you to execute with the mysql client. You must run only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file in the container — provide the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If needed I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3). I will explain the SQL/command I will run and then give one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in this container — confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any user/database to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize and start it, then run queries — still following the rule of providing one SQL statement per round.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the requested details (connection credentials or file path and the specific question). After that I will (a) explain my approach and the exact SQL I will run, and (b) provide a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and return the raw output.",
