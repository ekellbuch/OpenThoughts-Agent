  "analysis": "You are in a container where the mysql client has been installed and verified (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql), /etc/mysql only contains the client's fallback, /app is empty, and a filesystem search found no .env, SQL dump, or credential files to use. Without either (A) remote MySQL connection credentials, (B) a path to a local dump/database file, or (C) explicit permission to install and run a local MySQL server in this environment, I cannot execute any SQL statements or answer a database question.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you pick how to proceed. Choose one of the following and provide the requested details so I can act:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question you want answered.\n  - After you provide these, I will explain the SQL I'll run and then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation). You must run only that first SQL block and paste the raw mysql output back to me.\n\nOption 2 — Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container:\n  - Provide: exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file (if present) and the question to answer. If a tool is missing (gunzip, sqlite3) I can install it.\n  - I will explain the command/SQL I'll run and then present one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - If you want this, confirm and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create).\n  - I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create requested users/databases, and then run queries. This requires more steps and time; I will still present one SQL statement per round.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the required details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question), or explicitly authorize installing a local server and give the root password and any initial database/user info. Once you do, I will (a) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and (b) output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.",
