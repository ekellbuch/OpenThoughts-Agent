  "analysis": "The container now has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server running, no database files or dumps in /app, and no credentials or env files were found. I cannot run any SQL yet because there is no target database (remote or local) to connect to and no SQL dump to inspect. You have not provided a question or connection details or a path to any database file.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Provide one of the following so I can continue:\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server you control: supply host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of a .my.cnf), and optionally the database name, plus the question you want answered. Once provided, I will explain the SQL I will run and then output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (per your rules). You should run that SQL using the mysql client and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container: give the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file. If necessary I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3) to inspect it. Tell me the question you want answered about that data. I will explain the SQL or command I will run and then provide one SQL statement (or appropriate single command) in the required format for you to execute.\n\n3) Install and start a local MySQL server in this container: say you want this and provide desired root password and any user/db to create. I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, and then run queries (still following the one-SQL-per-round rule). Note this is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nWhen you reply, include which option you choose and the necessary details (connection credentials or file path and the specific question). After that I will (a) explain my approach and the exact SQL I will run, and (b) provide the single-line SQL code block to execute.",
