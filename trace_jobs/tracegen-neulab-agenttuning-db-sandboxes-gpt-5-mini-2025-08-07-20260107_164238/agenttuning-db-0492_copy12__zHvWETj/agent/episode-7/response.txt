  "analysis": "I have installed the MySQL client (/usr/bin/mysql) in the container and verified it works. There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql server config beyond the client's fallback), /app is empty, and no database dump or credential files were found. Without a running server, credentials, or a dump/database file to inspect, I cannot execute SQL to answer a question about a database.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of these options so I can proceed:\n\n1) Connect to a running MySQL server you control (recommended). Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or tell me you will provide a .my.cnf), and optionally the database name. Once you provide them and the SQL question, I will: (a) explain the SQL I will run, (b) present exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block as required, and (c) you will run it and give me the raw MySQL output for me to process. Example test I would run first: SELECT VERSION();\n\n2) Inspect a SQL dump or DB file already in the container. Provide the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file. If needed I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3) to inspect it. I will then explain and run a single SQL statement (or appropriate command) to extract the requested information.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server inside the container. If you want this, say so and I will install mysql-server, initialize it, start it, and create users/databases as needed. Note: this requires more steps and time and may need you to provide desired credentials.\n\nWhat I will do after you pick an option and provide details: I will explain the exact SQL I intend to run and why, then output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (no extra commentary in that block). You must run only the first SQL block I provide and paste the resulting raw MySQL output back to me; I will parse it and continue iterating until we reach a final answer. If you are ready for me to attempt a connection now, please provide the connection info (host, port, user, password, database) and the question to be answered, or provide the path to a dump or DB file in the container. If you want a local server installed, say so and I will proceed.",
