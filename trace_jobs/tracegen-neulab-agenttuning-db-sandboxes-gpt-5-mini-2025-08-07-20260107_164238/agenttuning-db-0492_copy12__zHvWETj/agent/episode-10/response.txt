  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and verified. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql data dir, no /etc/mysql server config beyond the client's fallback), /app is empty, and no SQL dumps or credential files were found on the filesystem. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target database to connect to and you have not provided connection credentials or a path to a database/dump file.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three ways to proceed and provide the required details: 1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server: give host, port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or tell me you'll supply ~/.my.cnf) and the database name (optional), plus the question to be answered. After you provide this I will explain the SQL I'll run and then give exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required SQL code block format for you to execute. 2) Inspect a local dump or DB file in the container: give the exact path to a .sql / .sql.gz / .db / .sqlite file and the question; I'll install any needed tools and provide the one-line SQL or command to run. 3) Install and run a local MySQL server in the container: tell me to proceed and provide desired root password and any user/db to create; I will install mysql-server and initialize it, then run queries per your protocol. \n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and the necessary details (connection info or file path and the exact question). Once you provide that, I'll (a) explain my intended SQL, and (b) output a single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
