  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql data directory and no server config), /app is empty, and no .env, SQL dump, or credential files were found. I cannot execute any SQL because there is no target database: you have not provided remote connection credentials, a path to a local dump/database file, nor permission to install and run a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "You must pick one of three options so I can proceed:\n\n1) Connect to a running remote MySQL server (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or tell me you'll provide ~/.my.cnf), optional database name, and the exact question to answer. I will explain the SQL I will run and then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to run with the mysql client and return the raw output.\n\n2) Inspect a local dump or DB file inside the container: provide the exact path to a .sql, .sql.gz, .db, or .sqlite file and the question to answer. If needed I can install tools (gunzip, sqlite3). I will explain the command/SQL I will run and then present one single-line SQL statement or command for you to execute and return the output.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL server in this container: confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (and any initial user/database to create). I will install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create any requested user/database, and then run queries. This is more invasive and takes longer.\n\nWhen you choose an option and provide the required details (connection credentials or file path and the exact question), I will:\n- Explain the exact SQL I will run and why.\n- Provide exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You must run only that first SQL block and paste back the raw MySQL output so I can parse it and continue.",
