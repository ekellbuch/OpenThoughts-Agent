Please choose one of the following options and provide any required details:\n\n- Inspect local server: list databases (no extra info), show tables in a database (provide database name), or describe a table (provide database.table).\n- Query data: give the database and table name and the query objective (e.g., select rows matching conditions, aggregations).\n- Create schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows to insert; I will produce CREATE/INSERT statements one at a time.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) plus the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify the action and any needed details, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either: (A) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (B) Answer — output the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern once I have enough information/results.",
