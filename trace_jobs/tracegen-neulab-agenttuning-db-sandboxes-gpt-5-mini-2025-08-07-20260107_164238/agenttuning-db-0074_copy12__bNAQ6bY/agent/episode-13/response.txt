I installed the mysql client and server, started mysqld_safe, and verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables on this server, and you have not provided a specific question or any remote MySQL connection details.

  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database task or question to answer. Pick one of these options and provide any required names/credentials:\n\n- Inspect local server: tell me which inspection you want (e.g., list databases, show tables in a database, describe a table). I will then produce a single SQL statement for you to run.\n- Query data: provide the database and table names and the query you need (e.g., find rows matching conditions). I will explain the SQL and then produce the single SQL statement to execute.\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows you want; I will generate the CREATE/INSERT statements one at a time (each as a single SQL operation).\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there.\n\nWhen I operate, I will follow your required format exactly: I will output 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (no other text). You will execute only that SQL, return its output, and I will continue by analyzing the result and either issuing another operation or returning the final answer with 'Action: Answer'.\n\nTell me which option you want and give any necessary database/table names or connection credentials. After you do, I will produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute.",
