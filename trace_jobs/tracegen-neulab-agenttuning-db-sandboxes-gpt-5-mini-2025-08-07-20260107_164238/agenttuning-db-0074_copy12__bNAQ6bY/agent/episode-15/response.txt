  "analysis": "The container has a working mysql client and a running local MySQL server. I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server and started mysqld_safe; a verification query (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables visible on this server. You have not provided a specific question, target database/table, or remote connection details yet. The shell is idle at the root prompt.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me the exact database task. Please choose one of the options below and provide any needed details (database/table names or remote connection credentials):\n\n1) Inspect local server: list databases, show tables in a database (specify database), or describe a table (specify database.table). If you pick this I will produce a single SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation and one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute.\n\n2) Query data: provide the database and table names and the query you want (e.g., find matching rows, aggregation). I will explain the SQL and then produce one SQL statement in the required format for you to run.\n\n3) Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows to create. I will produce CREATE and INSERT statements one at a time (each as a single SQL operation) following your required pattern.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there; I will craft the SQL and specify the connection command to run.\n\nWhen you tell me which option and provide any necessary names/credentials, I will: (a) explain the SQL I intend to run, and (b) emit exactly one SQL statement as required (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return its output; I will analyze that output and either emit another operation or provide the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format.",
