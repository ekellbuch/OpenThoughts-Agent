  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server (started via mysqld_safe). I previously installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server and verified the server with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote MySQL connection credentials. The shell is idle at the root prompt ready for the next action.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want to do next. Choose one of the options and provide any required details (database/table names or remote connection credentials):\n\nOptions:\n1) Inspect local server:\n   - List databases (already done). If you want again I can run: SHOW DATABASES;\n   - Show tables in a database: tell me the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n   - Describe a table: tell me database.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE database.table;\n\n2) Query data from an existing table: provide database and table names and the question (e.g., select rows meeting conditions, count rows, aggregate). I will explain the SQL and then produce one SQL statement for you to execute.\n\n3) Create sample schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows to insert; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time (each as a single SQL operation).\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there; I will craft the SQL and the connection command.\n\nWhen you specify which action and give any necessary details, I will: (A) explain the exact SQL I intend to run and why, and (B) if we operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block and return its output; I will analyze it and either run another operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
