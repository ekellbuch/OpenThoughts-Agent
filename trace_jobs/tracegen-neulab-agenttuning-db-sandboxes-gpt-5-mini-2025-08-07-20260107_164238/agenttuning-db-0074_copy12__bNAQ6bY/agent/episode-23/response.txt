  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server (started via mysqld_safe). A verification command returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, the names of any user databases/tables to inspect, nor any remote MySQL connection credentials. The shell is idle at the root prompt waiting for further instructions.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me the exact database task or question. Please choose one of these options and provide any required details so I can proceed:\n\n- Inspect local server: tell me which inspection you want (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; — already done, SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;, or DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;). Provide the target database/table name.\n- Query data: provide the database and table name and the query objective (for example: select rows with certain conditions, counts, aggregations). I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then produce exactly one SQL statement for you to execute.\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows you want created; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time (each as a single SQL operation you will run).\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) plus the question to run there; I will craft the SQL and the connection command.\n\nWhen you specify the action and provide any required details, I will explain my intended SQL and then either: (A) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement following your required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block) for you to execute, or (B) Answer — output the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern once I have the necessary results.",
