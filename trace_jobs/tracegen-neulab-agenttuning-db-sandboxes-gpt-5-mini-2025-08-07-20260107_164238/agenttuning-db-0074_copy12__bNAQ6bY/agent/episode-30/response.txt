  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server (started with mysqld_safe). I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server and verified the server with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote MySQL connection details, so no SQL has been executed beyond the verification query. The shell is idle at the root prompt.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Pick one of these options and provide any required details (database/table names or remote credentials):\n\n- Inspect local server: list databases (already done), show tables in a database (provide the database name), or describe a table (provide database.table).\n- Query data: provide the database and table name plus the query objective (e.g., select rows meeting conditions, counts, aggregations).\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows you want created; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify which action and provide any necessary details, I will: (1) explain the SQL I intend to run and why, and (2) either 'Operate' — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block) for you to execute — or 'Answer' — output the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern once I have the necessary results.",
