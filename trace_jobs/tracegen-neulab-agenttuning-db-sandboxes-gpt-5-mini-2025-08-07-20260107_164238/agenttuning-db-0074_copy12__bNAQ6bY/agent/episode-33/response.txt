  "analysis": "The MySQL server (mysqld_safe) wrote that number of processes running is 0 and then mysqld restarted. That indicates the server was restarted recently. Previously I verified the server was running and listed default databases. To continue safely, we should re-check the server is accepting connections and list databases/tables as needed. No specific database question was provided yet.",
  "plan": "1) Verify the server is up by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\". This will confirm mysqld is accepting connections and show available databases. 2) Depending on the output you return, next steps will be to either inspect a specific database (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;) or run the SQL query you request. For now I'll run the SHOW DATABASES check.",
