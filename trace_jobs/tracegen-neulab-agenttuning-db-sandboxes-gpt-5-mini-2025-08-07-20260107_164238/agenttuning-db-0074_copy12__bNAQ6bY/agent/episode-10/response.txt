  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. I installed and started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user-created databases or tables visible, and you have not yet provided a specific question or external MySQL connection details. The shell is idle at the root prompt waiting for further instructions.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific database task or question to answer. Options you can choose from: (A) Query an existing database/table in this local server (if you have created one) — tell me the database and table names and the question; (B) Create sample schema/data here so we can run queries — describe the schema and sample data you want; (C) Connect to a remote MySQL server — provide host, port, username, and password (and optional database); (D) Ask for inspection steps I can run first (e.g., list databases, show tables in a database, describe a table). Once you specify which option and give any needed names/credentials, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the exact SQL needed, and 2) either 'Operate' (emit exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run) or 'Answer' (emit the final answer) depending on whether I need to query the server. Note: If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement as: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block; you will execute only the first SQL code block and return its output. Tell me which option you want and provide any required details (database/table names or connection credentials), and I will prepare the next single SQL operation.",
