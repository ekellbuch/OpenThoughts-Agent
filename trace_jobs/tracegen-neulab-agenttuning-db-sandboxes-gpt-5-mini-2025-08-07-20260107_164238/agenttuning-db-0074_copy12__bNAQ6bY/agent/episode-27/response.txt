  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server (started via mysqld_safe). I verified connectivity earlier with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote MySQL connection credentials, so I cannot run any further SQL or produce a final answer yet. The shell is idle at the root prompt.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify exactly what you want to do. Please choose one of the following options and provide any required details so I can proceed:\n\n1) Inspect the local server:\n   - List databases (no extra info needed).\n   - Show tables in a database: provide the database name.\n   - Describe a table: provide database.table.\n\n2) Query data from an existing table: provide database and table names and the query goal (e.g., select rows matching conditions, count, aggregate).\n\n3) Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows to create; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) plus the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify which action you want and provide any necessary names/credentials, I will: (a) explain the SQL I intend to run and why, and (b) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return its output; I will analyze that output and continue until I can produce the final answer with the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
