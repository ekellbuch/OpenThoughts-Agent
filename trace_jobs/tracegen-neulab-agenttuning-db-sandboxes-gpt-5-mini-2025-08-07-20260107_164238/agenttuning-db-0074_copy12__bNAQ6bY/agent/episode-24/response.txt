  "analysis": "You are at a root shell inside the container. A MySQL server has been installed and started (mysqld_safe) and the mysql client is available. A verification query returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables visible. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote connection credentials, so I cannot run any further SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly what you want to do next. Pick one of these options and provide any required details (database/table names or remote connection credentials). After you choose, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either (A) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format ('Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (B) Answer — output the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern when ready.\n\nOptions (choose one):\n1) Inspect local server:\n   - List databases (no extra info needed).\n   - Show tables in a specific database: give the database name (e.g., mydb).\n   - Describe a table: give database.table (e.g., mydb.users).\n2) Query existing data: provide database name, table name, and the query goal (e.g., select rows matching conditions, counts, aggregations).\n3) Create schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows you want me to create (I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time).\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) plus the question to run there.\n\nImportant: When I operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format. Example flow after you choose an option:\n- I explain the SQL I'll run and why.\n- I output:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  SELECT ...;\n  ```\n(only one SQL block — you will execute it and return the output). I will then analyze the output and continue or produce the final answer with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nPlease tell me which option you want and provide any necessary details (database/table names or remote credentials) so I can prepare the next single SQL operation.",
