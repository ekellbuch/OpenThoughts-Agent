  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside the container. I installed the MySQL client successfully, but attempting to connect failed with: ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2). That means there is no MySQL server (mysqld) listening on the local socket. At this point we have a working mysql client but no reachable MySQL server to run SQL against.",
  "plan": "I need your input about how you want to proceed. There are two safe options:\n\n1) Connect to an existing MySQL server you control: provide the connection details (host, port, user, password, database name if relevant). Once you provide them I will produce a single one-line SQL statement (in the required markdown format) to execute and will explain the expected result. Example connection command I would run (once you give credentials) is: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\". I will not run anything until you give the question and/or credentials.\n\n2) Start a local MySQL server inside this container so we can operate locally. If you want that, I can attempt to install and initialize a server and start it. Note: starting a system service via systemd may not work in this container; the safer approach is to install the server package and launch mysqld directly (or use mariadb-server). If you choose this, I will run commands to install the server and then initialize and start it, then connect and run SQL. Example commands I would run (if you approve) are:\n- apt-get install -y default-mysql-server\n- mysqld --initialize-insecure --datadir=/var/lib/mysql\n- mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n- mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\nTell me which option you prefer and, if option 1, provide the connection details and the specific question you want answered. If option 2, confirm you want me to attempt installing and starting a local server here. Once you tell me, I'll produce the exact single SQL statement (in the required markdown one-line SQL code block) to execute next, or I'll run the installation/start commands.",
