  "analysis": "The MySQL client and server are now installed and running in the container. I started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is an active local MySQL server and the mysql client is available, so we can run SQL statements against it.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your question about the database. When you provide a question, I will: 1) Think through what SQL is required and explain my reasoning. 2) Choose to either operate (run a SQL statement) or answer (finalize the result). If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL statement in a markdown code block on one line. You will execute that statement and return the output. I will then analyze the output and either run another operation or produce the final answer using the specified 'Action: Answer' pattern. Please provide the question and any relevant database/table names or credentials if you want me to target a non-default database.",
