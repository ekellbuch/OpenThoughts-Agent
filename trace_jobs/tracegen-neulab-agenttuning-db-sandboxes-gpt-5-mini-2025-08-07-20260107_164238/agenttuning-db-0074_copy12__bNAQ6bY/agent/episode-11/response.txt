  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. I installed and started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables visible in the server, and you have not provided a specific question or any remote connection details. The shell is idle at the root prompt waiting for further instructions.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or action you want. Options you can choose from: (A) Query an existing database/table on this local server — tell me the database and table names and the question; (B) Create sample schema/data here so we can run queries — describe the schema and sample rows you want; (C) Connect to a remote MySQL server — provide host, port, username, and password (and optional database); (D) Ask me to inspect the local server (list databases/tables/describe a table). When you provide the question or choose an option, I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the SQL needed; 2) Either 'Operate' (run exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer' (return the final answer). If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (no other text). You will execute the SQL in the first code block and return its output, and I will continue from there.",
