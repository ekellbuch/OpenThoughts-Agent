  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in a container where the MySQL client and server are installed and running. I started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables visible on this server. No question or target database/table has been provided yet, and no external connection details were given.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the database question or the action you want me to take. Possible next options (pick one):\n\n1) Inspect local server: I can list databases, list tables in a database, or describe a table. If you pick this, tell me which inspection you want and the target database/table. I will then 'Operate' by providing exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\n2) Query data: Provide the database and table names and the query you need (e.g., count rows, select rows meeting conditions). I will explain the SQL, then produce one SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to run.\n\n3) Create sample schema/data locally: Describe schema and sample rows to create, and I will produce the CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time (each operation will be a single SQL you execute and return output for).\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: Provide host, port, username, password (and database). I'll then craft the SQL to run on that server.\n\nWhen I operate, I will follow your required format exactly: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (no other SQL blocks). After you execute it and return the output, I'll analyze results and either run another operation or return the final answer using 'Action: Answer' and Final Answer: [...].\n\nTell me which option you want and provide any necessary names/credentials or the specific question to answer. Once you do, I will produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute.",
