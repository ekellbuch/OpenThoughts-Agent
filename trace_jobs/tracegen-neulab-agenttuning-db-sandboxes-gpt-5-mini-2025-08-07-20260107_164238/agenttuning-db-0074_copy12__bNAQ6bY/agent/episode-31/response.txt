Options you can choose from: (1) Inspect the local server (SHOW DATABASES, SHOW TABLES FROM <db>, DESCRIBE <db>.<table>), (2) Query data from a table (give db.table and query goal), (3) Create schema/data locally (describe schema and sample rows), or (4) Connect to a remote MySQL server (provide host, port, user, password). Once you specify the action and any needed details I will: explain the SQL I'll run, then either 'Operate' by outputting exactly one SQL statement in the required format or 'Answer' with the final result when ready.",
