I started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote connection credentials, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database action or question. Choose one of these and provide any required details so I can proceed:\n\n- Inspect local server: list databases (already done), show tables in a database (provide the database name), or describe a table (provide database.table).\n- Query data: give the database and table name plus the query objective (e.g., select rows with conditions, counts, aggregations).\n- Create schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows to create; I will produce CREATE TABLE/INSERT statements one at a time.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there.\n\nWhen you choose, I will (a) explain the SQL I intend to run and why, and (b) either 'Operate' — emitting exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block), which you will execute and return output for — or 'Answer' — emitting the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern once I have the necessary results.",
