I verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases visible yet, and you have not provided a specific question or target database/table to operate on.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the question you want answered (or provide external MySQL connection details if you want to target a remote server). Once you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the SQL needed. 2) Choose to either 'Operate' or 'Answer'. If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will execute that statement and return the output; I will analyze the output and either run further operations or produce the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you prefer, I can start by listing databases, tables, or a specific table's structure — tell me which action you want.",
