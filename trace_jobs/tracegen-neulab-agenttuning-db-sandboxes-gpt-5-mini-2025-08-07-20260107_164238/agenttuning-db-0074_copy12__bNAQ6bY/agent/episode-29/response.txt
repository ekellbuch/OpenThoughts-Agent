I verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user-created databases or tables yet. You have not provided a concrete question, target database/table names, or remote MySQL connection details, so I cannot run any further SQL that would be meaningful to your goal.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly what you want to do next. Please choose one of the following and provide any required details so I can proceed:\n\n- Inspect local server: (a) list databases (already done), (b) show tables in a database — provide the database name, or (c) describe a table — provide database.table.\n- Query data from an existing table: provide the database and table name and the exact question (e.g., select rows meeting a condition, count, aggregate by a column).\n- Create schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows to insert; I will produce CREATE TABLE and then INSERT statements (one SQL per operation).\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) plus the SQL question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify the action and any necessary details I will: (1) explain the SQL I intend to run and why, and (2) either 'Operate' — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block) for you to execute — or 'Answer' — output the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern once I have the necessary results.",
