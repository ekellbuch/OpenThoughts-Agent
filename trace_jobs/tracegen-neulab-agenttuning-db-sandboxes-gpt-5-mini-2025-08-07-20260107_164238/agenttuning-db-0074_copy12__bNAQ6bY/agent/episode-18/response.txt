I installed the MySQL client and server, started mysqld_safe, and verified the server is running with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote connection details yet, so no further SQL operations have been run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify which action you want. Please choose one and provide any required details (database/table names or remote connection credentials):\n\n- Inspect local server: list databases (no details needed), show tables in a database (provide database name), or describe a table (provide database.table).\n- Query data: provide the database and table name and the query objective (e.g., select rows with condition, count rows, aggregation).\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows to create.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password and the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify the action and any required details I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and the SQL required.\n2) If I need to run SQL, I will emit exactly one operation in the required format: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (no other SQL blocks). You will execute the statement and return its output. I will then analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or produce the final answer using the exact pattern 'Action: Answer' followed by Final Answer: [\"...\"] when I'm sure of the result.\n\nTell me which option you want and give the needed details so I can prepare the next single SQL operation or provide the answer.",
