I started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables on the server. No specific question, target database/table, or remote connection details have been provided by you yet. The shell is idle at the root prompt.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database task or question. Please choose one of the options and provide any required details:\n\n- Inspect local server: (a) list databases (no extra info needed), (b) show tables in a database (specify database name), or (c) describe a table (specify database.table).\n- Query data from an existing table: provide database name, table name, and the question (e.g., conditions, aggregation).\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and example rows to insert.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify the desired action and any needed names/credentials, I will: 1) explain the SQL I intend to run, and 2) either 'Operate' (output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Answer' (produce the final answer). If I operate, I will output the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block as you requested. You will run only the SQL in the first code block and return the output; I will then analyze that output and continue until we reach a final answer.",
