A verification query (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables visible.

  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database task or question. Please choose one of the options below and provide any required details so I can proceed:\n\n- Inspect local server: (a) list databases (already done), (b) show tables in a database — provide the database name, or (c) describe a table — provide database.table.\n- Query data: provide the database and table name plus the query objective (e.g., select rows meeting conditions, aggregation, counts).\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows to create; I will produce CREATE TABLE / INSERT statements one at a time.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the SQL question to run.\n\nOnce you specify which action you want and any necessary names/credentials, I will: 1) explain the SQL I intend to run, and 2) either 'Operate' (output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Answer' (output the final answer when ready). If I operate, I will output the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (no other SQL blocks). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the output; I will analyze it and continue as needed.",
