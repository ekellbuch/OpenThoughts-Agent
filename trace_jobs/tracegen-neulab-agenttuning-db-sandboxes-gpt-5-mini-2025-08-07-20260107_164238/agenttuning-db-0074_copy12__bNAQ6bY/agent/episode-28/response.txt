  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server (started with mysqld_safe). I verified connectivity earlier with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, table names, or remote MySQL connection details, so no further SQL operations have been executed. The shell is idle at the root prompt.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Pick one of these and provide any required details (database/table names or remote credentials):\n\n- Inspect local server: list databases (no extra info), show tables in a database (provide the database name), or describe a table (provide database.table).\n- Query data: provide the database and table name and the query objective (e.g., select rows with conditions, count, aggregate).\n- Create schema/data locally: describe the table schema and example rows to insert; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) plus the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify the action and any necessary details, I will explain my reasoning and then either (A) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute, or (B) Answer — return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. If operating, I will present exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block prefixed by the line 'Action: Operation' as you requested.",
