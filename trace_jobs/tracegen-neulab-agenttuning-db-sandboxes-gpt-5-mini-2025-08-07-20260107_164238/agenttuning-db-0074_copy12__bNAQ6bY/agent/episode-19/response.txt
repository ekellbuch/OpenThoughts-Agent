  "analysis": "The MySQL server is installed and running inside the container and the mysql client is available. You (or I) started mysqld_safe and verified connectivity: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables visible yet. No specific question, target database/table, or remote connection details have been provided, so no further SQL operations have been executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction about what you want to do next. Options you can choose from (pick one and provide any needed names/credentials):\n\n- Inspect local server: \"SHOW DATABASES;\" (already done), \"SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\", or \"DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\". If you pick an inspection, tell me the target database/table and I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run.\n\n- Query data: give the database and table name and the question (e.g., select rows matching conditions, count, aggregate). I will explain the SQL and then emit one SQL statement for you to execute.\n\n- Create schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows to insert. I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time (each time outputting exactly one SQL statement for you to run).\n\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, user, password (and optional database) plus the question to run there; I will craft the SQL and the connection command (you must provide credentials for me to operate remotely).\n\nWhen I operate I will follow your required format: first explain my reasoning, then output exactly one SQL statement prefixed with the line 'Action: Operation' and the SQL in a single-line markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL block and return its output. I will analyze the result and either run another operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified.",
