I verified connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables visible. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote MySQL connection credentials, so no further SQL operations have been executed. The shell is idle at the root prompt.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Pick one option and provide any required details so I can proceed. After you choose, I will explain my reasoning and then either (A) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (B) Answer — produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern when I'm ready.\n\nOptions (choose one and provide any names/credentials needed):\n- Inspect local server:\n  - List databases (no extra info needed).\n  - Show tables in a database: provide the database name (e.g., mydb).\n  - Describe a table: provide database.table (e.g., mydb.users).\n- Query data from an existing table: provide database and table name and the query objective (e.g., select rows with a condition, count rows, aggregation).\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows to insert; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there.\n\nWhen you reply with which option and the necessary details, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) output exactly one SQL operation in the required format for you to execute.",
