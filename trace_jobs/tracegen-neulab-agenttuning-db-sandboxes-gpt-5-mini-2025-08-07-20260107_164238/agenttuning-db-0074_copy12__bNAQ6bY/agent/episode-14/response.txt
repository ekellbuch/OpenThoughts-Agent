A verification command returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables visible, and you have not yet provided a specific question or external MySQL connection details. The shell is idle at the root prompt waiting for instructions.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact database task or question you want answered. Choose one of these options and provide any required names/credentials:\n\n- Inspect local server: (a) list databases, (b) show tables in a database, or (c) describe a table — provide the target database/table name.\n- Query data: provide the database and table names and the query goal (e.g., find rows matching a condition, aggregate results).\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows you want me to create.\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the question to run there.\n\nWhen you specify which action you want and give any necessary details, I will: 1) explain the SQL I intend to run and why, and 2) either 'Operate' (produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Answer' (return the final result). If I operate, I will output the single SQL statement as required (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). After you execute it and return the output, I will analyze the result and continue until I can produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
