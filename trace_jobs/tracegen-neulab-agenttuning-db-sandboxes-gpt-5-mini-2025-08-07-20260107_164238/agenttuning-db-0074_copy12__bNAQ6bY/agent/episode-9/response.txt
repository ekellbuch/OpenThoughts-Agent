  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container where the MySQL client and server are installed and running. I verified the server with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user-created databases or tables visible yet and you have not provided a specific question or any external MySQL connection details.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or the connection details for a remote server. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the SQL required. 2) Decide whether to 'Operate' (run exactly one SQL statement) or to produce the final answer. If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start the line with 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will execute that statement and return the output. I will then analyze the output and either perform another operation or provide the final answer using the exact pattern: 'Action: Answer' followed by Final Answer: [ ... ].\n\nIf you don't know what to ask, you can choose one of these starter actions and I will produce the single SQL to run:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- Show tables in a database (replace mydb): SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;\n- Describe a table (replace mydb.mytable): DESCRIBE mydb.mytable;\n- Query rows from a table (specify table and conditions): SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE ...;\n- Create sample schema/data (specify what you want to create).\n\nTell me which action or question you want, or provide host/port/user/password if you want to target a remote MySQL server. I will then produce the single SQL statement to execute as required.",
