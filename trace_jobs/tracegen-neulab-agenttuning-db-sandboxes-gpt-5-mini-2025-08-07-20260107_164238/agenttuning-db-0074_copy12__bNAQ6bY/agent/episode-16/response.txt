Pick one of the options below and provide any required details (database/table names or remote connection credentials). Once you specify, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run, and (2) either 'Operate' (emit exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Answer' (emit the final answer). Options:\n\n1) Inspect local server:\n   - List databases (no extra info needed).\n   - Show tables in a database: provide the database name.\n   - Describe a table: provide database.table.\n\n2) Query data from an existing table: provide database, table name, and the question (e.g., conditions, aggregation).\n\n3) Create sample schema/data locally: describe the schema and sample rows; I will produce creation and insert SQL statements, one at a time.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the SQL question to run on that server.\n\nWhen you choose and provide details, I will output the single SQL operation in the required format (starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). I will wait for you to run that and return the output.",
