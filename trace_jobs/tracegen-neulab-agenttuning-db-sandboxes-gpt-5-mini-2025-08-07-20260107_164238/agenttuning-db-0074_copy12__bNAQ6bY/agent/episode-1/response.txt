We haven't connected to any MySQL server yet and no database credentials or question have been provided. To run SQL against a MySQL server we first need a MySQL client. After installing the client we'll attempt to connect (as root with no password) and list databases to confirm connectivity. If that fails due to authentication or missing server, we'll report that output and ask for credentials or further instructions.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) non-interactively. 2) Run a simple query to list databases: SHOW DATABASES; to confirm the server is reachable. 3) If the server is unreachable or authentication fails, report the output so you can provide credentials or the specific question to answer.\n\nCommands to run:\n- export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to avoid interactive prompts.\n- apt-get update to refresh package lists.\n- apt-get install -y default-mysql-client to install the mysql client.\n- mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to attempt connecting and listing databases.",
