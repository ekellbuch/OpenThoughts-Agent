I verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases visible yet. I have no question from you about which data to query or modify.",
  "plan": "I will wait for the specific question you want answered about the database. When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the problem and the SQL needed. 2) Decide to either 'Operate' (run a single SQL statement) or 'Answer' (return final results). If operating, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with the line 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL block in markdown; you will execute that and return the output to me. I will then analyze the output and continue with further operations or produce the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' pattern. Please tell me the question you want answered and (if applicable) the target database and table names or credentials for a remote server.",
