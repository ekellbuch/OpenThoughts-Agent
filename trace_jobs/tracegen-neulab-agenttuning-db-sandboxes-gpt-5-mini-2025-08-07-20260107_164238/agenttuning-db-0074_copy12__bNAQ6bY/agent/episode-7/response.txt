I verified connectivity earlier with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys.

  "plan": "Wait for your specific question or instruction. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the SQL needed. 2) Choose to either 'Operate' (run exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer' (finalize results). If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block; you will run it and return the output. Possible first operations I can perform now (pick one):\n- List databases (already done).\n- Show tables in a specific database: e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show structure of a table: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Query rows: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE ...;\nTell me which action you want or provide remote MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password) and the question to answer. I will then produce the single SQL statement to execute as required.",
