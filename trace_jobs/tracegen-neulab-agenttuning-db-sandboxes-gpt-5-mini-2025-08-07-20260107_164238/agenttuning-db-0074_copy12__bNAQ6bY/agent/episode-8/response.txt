I previously verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases visible and you haven't provided a specific question or external connection details. I'm currently idle at the shell prompt waiting for your instruction or database question.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the question you want answered (or provide remote MySQL connection details if you want to target a different server). When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the problem and the SQL required. 2) Choose to either 'Operate' (run exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer' (produce the final answer). If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (no other text). You will execute that SQL and return the output; I will analyze it and continue until I can produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to take an initial action now, choose one of these options and I will produce the single SQL accordingly: - List databases (SHOW DATABASES;) - Show tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;) - Describe a table (DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;) - Query rows (provide table and conditions) - Create sample data/schema (specify schema)\n\nPlease tell me which action you want or give the exact question and any connection details. Once you do, I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
