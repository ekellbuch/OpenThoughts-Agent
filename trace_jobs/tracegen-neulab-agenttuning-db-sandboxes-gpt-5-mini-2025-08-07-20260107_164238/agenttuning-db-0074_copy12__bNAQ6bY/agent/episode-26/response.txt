  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container where I installed the MySQL client and server and started mysqld_safe. I verified the server is running with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, target database/table names, or remote MySQL connection credentials, so no further SQL has been executed and I cannot produce a result yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Choose one of these options and provide any required details (database/table names or remote credentials):\n\n- Inspect local server:\n  - List databases (no extra info needed).\n  - Show tables in a database: provide the database name (e.g., mydb).\n  - Describe a table: provide database.table (e.g., mydb.users).\n\n- Query data from an existing table: provide database and table name and the question (for example: select rows matching a condition, count rows, aggregate by a column).\n\n- Create sample schema/data locally: describe the table schema and sample rows you want created; I will produce CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements one at a time.\n\n- Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (and optional database) and the SQL question to run there.\n\nWhen you pick an option and provide the necessary details, I will: (1) explain the SQL I plan to run, and (2) either 'Operate' — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block) for you to execute — or 'Answer' — output the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern once I have the needed results.",
