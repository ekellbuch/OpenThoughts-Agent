  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in the container (/app). No MySQL session is open and there is no prior command output shown that indicates a running MySQL server or database connection. Before issuing SQL statements I need to confirm whether a MySQL server is running in this environment, locate the MySQL socket/port, and find appropriate client credentials (environment variables or files) so I can connect and run SQL. Currently nothing has been accomplished toward that goal.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current directory and working directory to see if any project files or database credentials are present. 2) Check /var/run and specifically /var/run/mysqld for a MySQL socket. 3) Check running processes for mysqld to determine whether the server is running. 4) Check mysql client availability/version. 5) Search environment variables for MYSQL-related entries. 6) Check listening TCP sockets for MySQL (port 3306) to find host/port. These steps will tell me how to connect to the database (socket or host:port) and whether credentials may be present in environment variables or files. Once I have that info I will propose the SQL command to run (one SQL statement per your workflow).",
