  "analysis": "I inspected the container. There are no application files in /app. There is no MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld socket directory and no mysqld process). The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). The ss/netstat utilities are also not present. At this point I cannot run SQL because I have no client and no server/socket/host to connect to. To proceed I need to either locate an existing database socket/configuration/files on the filesystem or install a MySQL client and obtain connection details (host/port/user/password).",
  "plan": "1) Search common MySQL configuration and socket locations to see if a server exists somewhere unexpected (/etc/mysql, .sock files, my.cnf). 2) Search the filesystem for database files (SQL dumps, sqlite files) which might satisfy the request without a running server. 3) Check package manager to confirm mysql client absence. Based on results I will either (a) connect using found socket/credentials (and then issue the single SQL you request), or (b) request credentials or install a client if you want me to attempt that. The commands below perform the filesystem searches and client-package checks.",
