  "analysis": "The mysql client has now been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). Previously there was no local MySQL server, no mysql client, and no obvious SQL dumps or .env files in /app. At this point we have the client available but still no information about a running MySQL server or connection credentials. To run SQL I either need a reachable MySQL server (local socket or TCP) or a SQL dump/database file to query. None of those have been found yet.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether any process is listening on the MySQL TCP port (3306). 2) Inspect environment variables for any MySQL-related connection info (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, etc.). 3) Inspect /etc/mysql/my.cnf (and /etc/mysql directory) to see any configured defaults (socket, datadir). 4) Search the filesystem for files containing the string \"mysql\" or typical env keys (to try to find credentials or connection configuration). If I find a running server or credentials, I'll use the mysql client to connect and then run the SQL you request. If none are found, I'll ask you to provide the host and credentials or a SQL dump to operate on.",
