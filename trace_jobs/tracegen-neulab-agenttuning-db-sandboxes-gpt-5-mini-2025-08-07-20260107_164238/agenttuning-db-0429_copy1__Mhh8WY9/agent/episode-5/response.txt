  "analysis": "You are root in the container and the mysql client has been installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local mysqld process and no obvious database files in /app. I attempted to check listening sockets but ss was absent. /etc/mysql exists (client config fallback) but there is no /var/run/mysqld or datadir visible. No environment variables with MySQL credentials were found. To run SQL I still need either: a reachable MySQL server (local or remote) or a SQL dump/database file to query. Right now we have a client but no target to connect to and no credentials discovered.",
  "plan": "1) Determine whether a MySQL server is listening on TCP by checking for netstat/ss and, if needed, installing net-tools to get netstat. 2) Use netstat to look for processes listening on port 3306. 3) Search common locations (/etc, /root, /home, /var, /opt, /app) for environment files, docker-compose files, SQL dumps, or files containing typical MySQL environment variables (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD) that might contain connection info. If we find a running server or credentials, we'll connect with the mysql client. If nothing is found, I'll report back and ask you to provide connection details or a SQL dump to operate on.",
