  "analysis": "From the previous commands: I'm root in /app. There is no /etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld, or /var/lib/mysql present. No mysqld/mysql processes are running. The mysql client is not installed and there's no /root/.my.cnf. In short: there is no visible MySQL server or client installed, and no obvious MySQL configuration. To proceed I need either a MySQL server/socket to connect to, a SQL dump or database file to inspect, or credentials to connect to a remote server. Right now none of those are evident. I will search the workspace and system for any SQL files, database files, docker/docker-compose files, environment files, or listening MySQL ports which could indicate where a database is.",
  "plan": "1) List files in /app to see if the project contains database dumps or config. 2) Search the filesystem for common database-related files: *.sql, *.sql.gz, *.db, *.sqlite, docker-compose.yml, and .env. 3) Check whether any process is listening on the MySQL TCP port (3306) to detect a running remote/hosted DB. 4) Search inside /app for occurrences of the string \"mysql\" to find credentials or connection info. Based on findings, either connect to a local socket or remote host (if present) or locate a SQL dump to run queries against. Each command is chosen to reveal artifacts that would let me run SQL statements.",
