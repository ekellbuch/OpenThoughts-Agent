  "analysis": "So far: I'm root in /app. There is no MySQL server or client installed on the container: /etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql do not exist; no mysqld process is running; mysql client is not found; no .my.cnf and no SQL/dump files were found in the filesystem under /app. To execute SQL I need a MySQL client (or a reachable remote MySQL server). Right now there is neither a client nor a local server, and no connection info. The next logical step is to install a MySQL client in the container so I can attempt to connect to any remote server (if you provide host/credentials) or to run queries if a local server later appears.",
  "plan": "1) Detect which package manager is available (apt-get, apk, yum, dnf). 2) Try to install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client and mariadb-client packages) using the available package manager. 3) Verify installation by running mysql --version. If installation fails due to lack of network or unavailable package manager, I will report that and ask for connection details or a SQL dump. Expected results: After a successful install, mysql --version will print the client version and I'll be able to use the mysql client to run SQL statements or connect to a remote server when you provide credentials.",
