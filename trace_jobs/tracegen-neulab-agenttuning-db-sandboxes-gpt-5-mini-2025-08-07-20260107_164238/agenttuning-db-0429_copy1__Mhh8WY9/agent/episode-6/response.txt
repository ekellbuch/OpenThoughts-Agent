  "analysis": "The last response from the terminal echoed the commands instead of giving their outputs — so we don't yet know whether ss or netstat is available or whether any service listens on 3306, nor have we got results from the searches for env/SQL files. Previously we successfully installed the mysql client. Next I will check for a socket-listening tool, install net-tools if needed, check for listeners on port 3306, and search common locations for environment files or database dumps that might contain connection info or data to query. This will reveal whether a MySQL server is reachable or if there are files I can operate on locally.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether ss or netstat exists. 2) If neither exists, install net-tools (provides netstat). 3) Use netstat to look for a listener on port 3306 (MySQL default). 4) Search /etc, /root, /home, /var, /opt, and /app for files that might contain MySQL credentials or SQL dumps (.env, docker-compose.yml, *.sql, *.db, *.sqlite). 5) Search those directories for occurrences of \"MYSQL_HOST\", \"MYSQL_USER\", \"MYSQL_PASSWORD\", and the string \"mysql\" to try to find connection info. Based on findings we will either attempt to connect with the mysql client or ask you for remote connection details or a SQL dump.",
