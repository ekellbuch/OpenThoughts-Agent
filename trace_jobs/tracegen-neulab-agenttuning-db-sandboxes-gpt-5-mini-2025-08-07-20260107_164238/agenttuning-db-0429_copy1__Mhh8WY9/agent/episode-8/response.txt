  "analysis": "I am root in the container and the mysql client has been successfully installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local mysqld process or MySQL data directory visible, no SQL dumps or .env/docker-compose files were found in /app earlier, and no MySQL-related environment variables were present. I attempted to detect listeners on port 3306 and to search common locations for credentials or dumps, but those searches did not reveal a reachable server or files to operate on. In short: I have a working MySQL client but no target server or database to run SQL against.",
  "plan": "I need connection information or a database dump to proceed. Please provide one of the following: (A) remote MySQL connection details (host, port if nonstandard, username, password, and database name), or (B) an SQL dump or database file uploaded to the container (path) that I can import or query. Options I can perform once you provide details:\n- If you give connection credentials, I will craft a single SQL statement (as required) and you will execute it — or I can attempt to connect from the container using the mysql client if you want me to run connection tests here. Example connection test I would run locally: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n- If you provide a SQL dump file path, I can import it into a local temporary MariaDB server (if you want me to install one) or parse the dump for the requested query.\nIf you'd like me to install a local MySQL/MariaDB server instead, confirm and I will install and initialize it (this is heavier and will take longer).",
