  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally and no SQL dumps or environment files with credentials were found in the filesystem. I attempted to locate listeners on port 3306 and search for MYSQL_* variables or files but found nothing actionable. At this point I cannot run any SQL against a database because there is no known target (no server, no credentials, no dump).",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n1) Provide the question you want answered and remote MySQL connection details (host, port if not 3306, username, password, and database name). If you provide credentials I will either: (a) craft a single SQL statement for you to execute (per your rules), or (b) attempt to connect from this container using the mysql client and run the SQL. If you want me to run the SQL here, include clear permission to use the credentials in this environment.\n\n2) Upload or place an SQL dump or database file inside the container (give me the path). I can then either import it into a local server (if you permit me to install and run one) or parse/query the dump as appropriate.\n\n3) Instruct me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside the container (note: heavier change and will take longer). If you choose this, confirm and I will proceed to install and start a server, create a test database, and run the requested SQL.\n\nWhen you reply, also tell me the exact SQL question you want answered (what table/columns or the query goal). Once I have a target (credentials or dump or a local server), I will produce a single SQL statement inside a code block as required and label the action (Operation) so you can execute it.",
