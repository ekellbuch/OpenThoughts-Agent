  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu-based and apt-get is available. Attempts to install mysql/mariadb clients previously failed due to unmet dependencies and package conflicts. No mysql client is currently installed (mysql: command not found). To run SQL I need a client; resolving broken packages and then installing a mysql client should allow connecting to a MySQL server (local or remote) once you provide connection details or if a server is present.",
  "plan": "1) Ensure dpkg isn't in a half-configured state by running dpkg --configure -a. 2) Run apt-get install -f -y to try to fix broken dependencies. 3) Update package lists (apt-get update -y). 4) Try to install a MySQL client — attempt default-mysql-client and mysql-client; if that fails fall back to mariadb-client. 5) Verify installation with mysql --version. If installation still fails, I'll report the error output and request either remote DB credentials or a SQL dump to proceed.",
