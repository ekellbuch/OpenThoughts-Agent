  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container (prompt shown). No prior MySQL commands have been run in this session. There is no visible information about a running MySQL server, available client, or credentials. To operate a MySQL database I need to locate the MySQL server/socket, confirm the mysql client is available, and check for credentials (e.g. /root/.my.cnf). Once I find the server and credentials (or socket), I can run SQL statements against the database. Currently nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to a database.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm current user and working directory to ensure we have permissions. 2) Check common MySQL configuration and socket directories (/etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql) to discover if a server is installed/running and where the socket is. 3) Check running processes for mysqld to confirm a server process. 4) Check if the mysql client binary is present and its version. 5) Check for a client config file (~/.my.cnf) that might contain credentials. Based on the results, I'll request connection details or proceed to connect. Each command is chosen to reveal location/status of MySQL and possible credentials.",
