  "analysis": "We successfully installed the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44). So far there is no running local MySQL server discovered and no obvious database files or credentials in /app. The terminal earlier echoed some commands instead of showing their outputs, so we don't yet know whether any process is listening on port 3306 or whether there are files elsewhere containing DB connection info. I still need to determine whether a MySQL server is reachable (local or remote) or find configuration/credential files or SQL dumps to operate on.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether ss or netstat exists. 2) Install net-tools (netstat) if needed. 3) Use netstat to see if anything is listening on TCP port 3306 (MySQL). 4) Check environment variables for mysql-related entries. 5) Search /etc, /root, /home, /var, /opt, and /app for files containing MYSQL_* keys. 6) Find common files that might contain DB dumps or credentials (.env, docker-compose.yml, *.sql, *.db, *.sqlite). These steps will reveal whether we can connect to a running MySQL server or if we have a dump to query locally. If we find a server or credentials, the next step will be to run a SQL statement (you instructed that I may only run one SQL per round and you will execute it).",
