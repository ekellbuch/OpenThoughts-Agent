  "analysis": "I checked the container and confirmed the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. I don't have any environment variables or a ~/.my.cnf with credentials. Therefore there is currently no database to run SQL against from this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL yet. To proceed you must choose one of the following:\n\n1) Provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host or socket path, port if TCP, username, password, and the database name) and the specific question you want answered. Once you provide that, I will produce a single SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either give the final answer or provide the next single SQL probe as needed.\n\n2) Permit me to install and initialize a local database server in this container. If you allow this, I will (a) install mariadb-server (or mysql-server) using apt, (b) initialize the data directory, (c) start the server, and (d) create a temporary root password or configure socket auth. After the server is running I can run SQL queries. Installing and starting a server will modify the container and may require a short wait; tell me explicitly if you want me to proceed.\n\nIf you pick option 1, include the SQL question and credentials. If you pick option 2, confirm and I will run the necessary installation commands and then run the SQL you request.",
