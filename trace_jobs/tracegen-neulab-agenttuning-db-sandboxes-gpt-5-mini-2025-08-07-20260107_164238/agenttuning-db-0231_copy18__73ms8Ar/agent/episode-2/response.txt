  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client into the container. Current state: there is no local MySQL server process (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, no mysqld in ps), but the mysql client (mysql Ver 8.0.44) is now available. I cannot run any SQL yet because I don't have a server to connect to or credentials for a remote server. To proceed I need either connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port or socket, username, password, and optionally database) or permission to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you (a) provide the question you want answered and (b) provide connection credentials (host/port or socket, user, password, database) or explicitly allow me to install and start a local server. Once you provide the DB connection info and the SQL question, I will: 1) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. 2) I'll analyze the output, explain my reasoning, and either (a) run another single SQL statement (again providing it in the required format) if more probing is needed, or (b) produce the final answer using the exact Final Answer pattern when I'm certain of the result. If you want me to set up a local server instead, tell me and I will install mariadb-server, initialize it, and start it (I will request permission first).",
