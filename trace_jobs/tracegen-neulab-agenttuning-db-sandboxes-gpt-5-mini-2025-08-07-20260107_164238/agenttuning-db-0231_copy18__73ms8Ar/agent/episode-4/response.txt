  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (mysql Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld, and no mysqld process was found earlier). I have not been given any database connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database) nor a specific question to answer with SQL. Without a reachable server or credentials I cannot execute SQL statements against a database.",
  "plan": "I will run two safe, non-destructive checks: locate the mysql client binary and show the top of the mysql --help output so you (or I) can see the client usage and options for connecting (host/port/user/password/socket). After that, you should either: (A) provide the DB connection details and the SQL question you want answered, or (B) explicitly allow me to install and initialize a local database server (mariadb-server) in this container so I can create/inspect databases locally. Once you provide connection details or permission to install a server, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format for you to run and return its output for analysis.",
