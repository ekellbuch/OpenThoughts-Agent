  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but there is no reachable MySQL/MariaDB server: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are also no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment until I either (A) receive connection details for an existing remote database or (B) am explicitly permitted to install and start a local database server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL or modify the container until you pick one of two options and provide the required information.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the target database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe the data you need or the query goal).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single line SQL statement inside a markdown code block, preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow me to install and initialize a local server, and tell me which package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server).\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide it) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n- If you permit installation I will: install the server package via apt, initialize/start the server appropriate for the container, configure root access per your instructions, and then run the SQL you request. After the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute or will execute it here if you permit.\n\nWhen you reply, include only one option choice and the necessary details. If you choose Option A, include the connection details and the SQL question. If you choose Option B, confirm installation, the server package preference, and root-access method/password. I will then proceed exactly as described.",
