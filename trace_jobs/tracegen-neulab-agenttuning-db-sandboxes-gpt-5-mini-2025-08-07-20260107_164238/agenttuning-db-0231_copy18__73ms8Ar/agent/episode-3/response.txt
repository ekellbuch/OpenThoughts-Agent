There is still no MySQL server running locally: /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist and no mysqld process was found earlier. I cannot execute any SQL against a database until I have either (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port or socket, username, password, database) or (B) permission to install, initialize, and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container. You also haven't yet provided the specific question you want answered from the database.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide one of the following: 1) The database connection details (host/IP, port or socket path, username, password, and target database) and the question you want answered; or 2) Permission to install and initialize a local server (I will then install mariadb-server, initialize the data directory, set a root password or configure socket auth, start the server, and create any sample databases/tables necessary). Once you provide DB access and the SQL question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze and continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.",
