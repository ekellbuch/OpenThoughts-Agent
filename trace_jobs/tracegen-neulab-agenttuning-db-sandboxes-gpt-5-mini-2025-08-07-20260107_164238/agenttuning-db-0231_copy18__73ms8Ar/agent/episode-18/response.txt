  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible here: earlier checks showed no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two explicit options and provide the required details. Tell me exactly one of the options below and include the requested information so I can proceed.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe the data to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n- After you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either give the Final Answer or provide the next single SQL probe.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow me to install and initialize a local server and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n- If you permit installation I will: install the chosen server package via apt, initialize/start the server appropriate for a container environment, configure root access per your instructions, and then run the SQL you request. After the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for the query you requested, or run it here if you permit.\n\nImportant workflow notes:\n- I will only provide one SQL statement per round, formatted exactly as you required (Action: Operation plus one-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze and continue.\n- When I am certain of the final answer I will output exactly: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (include connection details and the SQL question) or Option B (explicitly permit installation, state server package choice, and root access method/password).",
