  "analysis": "The environment has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no accessible MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Because of that, I cannot execute SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two explicit options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one of the following and include the requested details (no extra text):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database:\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe what to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nWorkflow for Option A: After you provide credentials and the question, I will return exactly one SQL statement in the required format: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow installation and tell me which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nWorkflow for Option B: If you permit installation I will install and initialize the chosen server package via apt, start the server (launching the daemon directly if systemd is unavailable), configure root access per your instructions, and then produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for the query you request or run it here if you allow.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option and the requested details so I can continue. I will not run any SQL or install a server until you explicitly instruct me to do so.",
