  "analysis": "Current state: the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container. I previously checked for mysqld/mariadbd processes, common runtime directories, socket files, and port 3306 listeners — none were found. There are no stored credentials (no /root/.my.cnf and no relevant env vars). Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two explicit options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if TCP), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (the SQL query goal).\n- After you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block). You will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and either produce the Final Answer pattern or give the next single SQL probe.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you permit me to install and initialize a local server and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to use socket authentication.\n- If you permit installation I will run the necessary apt commands to install the server, initialize/start it, and then run the SQL you request. After the server is running I will produce the one-line SQL statement as described above for you to run (or I will run it here if you allow me to operate directly).\n\nFormatting and workflow notes (important):\n- When I provide an SQL operation it will follow your required pattern exactly: the single SQL statement will appear in the first markdown code block and will be one line. I will precede it with the line: Action: Operation\n- I will only include one SQL statement per round. I will wait for you to execute it and return the raw MySQL output.\n- When I am certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n  and nothing else in that final pattern.\n\nPlease reply with one of the options and the required details so I can continue. If you choose Option A, include the DB connection details and the specific question. If you choose Option B, confirm installation, the server package choice, and how to configure root access (password or socket).",
