  "analysis": "The environment has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but no reachable MySQL/MariaDB server. Earlier checks show no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this container until you either (A) provide remote DB connection details or (B) permit installing and starting a local database server here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear options and provide the required information. Give one explicit response only (Option A or Option B) with the requested details so I can proceed.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or Unix socket path), port (if TCP; default 3306), username, password (or indicate empty), and database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe what you want SELECTed/aggregated/filtered).\n- Once you provide the connection details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either give the final answer or provide the next single SQL probe.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Confirm explicitly you allow me to install and initialize a local server and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password). Note: starting a server may require additional initialization and a short wait.\n- If you permit installation I will run apt-get install of the chosen server package, initialize/start the server (using the appropriate method in a container environment), and configure root access per your instructions. After the server is running I will produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL block) for the query you requested.\n\nSecurity and format notes:\n- Do not post sensitive credentials in public channels if you are concerned. If you share credentials here, I will use them only to form the mysql client command and the SQL you requested.\n- I will follow your required workflow: only one SQL statement per round, returned in the exact format you specified. When confident of the final answer I will return: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"...\"] exactly as required.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A or Option B and include the necessary details so I can proceed.",
