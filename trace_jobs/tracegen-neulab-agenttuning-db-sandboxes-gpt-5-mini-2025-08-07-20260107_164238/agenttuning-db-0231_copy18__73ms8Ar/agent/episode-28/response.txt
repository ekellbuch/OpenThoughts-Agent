  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist, no mysql socket was found in common runtime locations, and no listener was detected on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (no /root/.my.cnf) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one of the two options so I can proceed. Reply with only one of the options and include the requested details (do not include extra text):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (preferred):\n- Provide: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact SQL question you want answered (what to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nAfter you supply Option A details I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either give the final answer or produce the next single SQL probe as needed.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow installation and state which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you permit Option B I will install and initialize the chosen server package via apt, start the server (launching the daemon directly if systemd is unavailable), configure root access per your instructions, and then run the SQL you request. After the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute or run it here if you permit.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (Option A or Option B) and the required details so I can continue.",
