  "analysis": "No MySQL server or client is present in the current container. I checked /var/run/mysqld and /var/lib/mysql (they don't exist), there is no /root/.my.cnf, no mysqld process, and the mysql client binary is not installed. At this point there is no local MySQL instance to run SQL against. To proceed I need either (A) the ability to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and possibly server) in this container so we can run SQL locally, or (B) connection details (host, port, username, password, database) for a remote MySQL server so I can use a client to connect. I will not attempt to start a local server unless you confirm you want that, because starting a server requires more steps (initialization, choosing root password or using socket auth) and may require installing server packages.",
  "plan": "1) Detect any environment variables or system info related to MySQL. 2) Install a MySQL/MariaDB client (using the available package manager) so we can run mysql commands from this container. 3) Verify the client is available. After that, ask you for connection details (or for permission to install and start a local server). If you provide a SQL question now, once the client is installed I can run a single SQL statement as you described. Commands below perform non-destructive probing and then install a client if possible. If installation fails due to lack of network or package manager, we'll report that and request credentials to connect from your environment or instructions to proceed.",
