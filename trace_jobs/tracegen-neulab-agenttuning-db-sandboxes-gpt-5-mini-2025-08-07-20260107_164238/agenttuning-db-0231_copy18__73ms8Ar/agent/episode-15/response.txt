  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. Because of this, no SQL can be executed against a database from this environment until either (A) you provide remote DB connection details or (B) you permit installing and starting a local server in the container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the two clear options and provide the required details. Option A (connect to an existing database): provide host (or socket), port (if non‑default), username, password (or indicate none), database name (if applicable), and the exact question you want answered. After that I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and continue iteratively until I can return the Final Answer. Option B (install a local server): explicitly permit installation and tell me which package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server) and whether to set a root password (provide it) or use socket authentication. If you permit installation I will install, initialize, and start the server and then run queries. I will not perform any installation or execute SQL until you explicitly choose one of these options and provide the needed details.",
