  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, no mysql socket found in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are also no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf is absent) and no MySQL-related environment variables. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now. No SQL question or DB connection details have been provided by you yet.",
  "plan": "I will not modify the container or run any SQL until you explicitly choose one of the two options below and provide the required details. Please reply with exactly one option and the requested information.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate none), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe the data to select/aggregate/filter).\n- Once you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either give the Final Answer or produce the next single SQL probe as needed.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow me to install and initialize a local server and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n- If you permit installation I will: install the chosen server package via apt, initialize/start the server appropriate for a container environment, configure root access per your instructions, and then run SQL queries. After the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for the query you requested, or run it here if you permit.\n\nNotes about workflow and format:\n- I will always provide only one SQL statement per round in the exact pattern you specified when performing operations.\n- When ready to deliver the final answer I will output exactly: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (and include connection details + the SQL question) or Option B (and explicitly permit installation, choose server package, and specify root-access method/password).",
