  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (no /root/.my.cnf and no MySQL-related environment variables). You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I will not modify the container or attempt to install/run a database server without your explicit permission. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what you need selected/aggregated/filtered).\n\nWorkflow for Option A: after you provide credentials and the SQL question, I will give exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL probe or provide the final answer in the exact required pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow me to install and initialize a local server and tell me which package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server).\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you choose Option B I will: install the chosen server package via apt, initialize the data directory (using the server's recommended initialization tool), start the server in the container environment (by launching the daemon directly if systemd is not available), and configure root access per your instructions. Once the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for the query you requested, or run it here if you permit.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (Option A or Option B) and the required details so I can continue. I will not run any SQL or install any server until you explicitly instruct me to do so.",
