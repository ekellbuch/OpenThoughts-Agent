  "analysis": "The mysql client was installed and I ran mysql --help which confirms mysql client (Ver 8.0.44) is available. Previously there was no mysqld process and no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld. At this point there still appears to be no local MySQL server running. I cannot execute SQL until I have a reachable server (either local or remote) and credentials. You need to either provide database connection details (host, port or socket path, username, password, database) or allow me to install and initialize a local server.",
  "plan": "I'll run a few quick checks to: 1) confirm the path to the mysql client binary, 2) check whether any process is listening on the MySQL TCP port 3306, and 3) search for any mysql socket file on the filesystem. These are non-destructive probes that will confirm whether a server might be accessible locally via TCP or socket. After these checks, please provide the DB connection info or permission to install/start a local server and tell me the specific question you want answered so I can produce the single SQL statement in the required format.",
