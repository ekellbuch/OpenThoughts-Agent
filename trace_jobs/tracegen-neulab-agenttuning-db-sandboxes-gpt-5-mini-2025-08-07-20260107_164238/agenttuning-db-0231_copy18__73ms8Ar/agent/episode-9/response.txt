  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server available in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket found, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no environment variables referencing MySQL. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from here until I either (A) receive remote connection details or (B) am permitted to install and start a local database server in this container.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the two options you want to proceed with:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (preferred if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if TCP), username, password (or indicate no password), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what you want retrieved/aggregated/modified).\n\nOnce you provide those, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and return its raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either produce the final Answer or provide another single SQL probe as needed.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Confirm you want me to install a server (mariadb-server or mysql-server). Tell me which package you prefer and whether to set a root password (if yes, provide it) or to use socket authentication.\n- If you permit, I will: install the server package, initialize the data directory if needed, start the service, and create/login as root or another user so we can run SQL.\n\nPlease reply with your choice and required details. I will not run any SQL until you either provide DB credentials and the SQL question (Option A) or explicitly permit installation of a local server (Option B).",
