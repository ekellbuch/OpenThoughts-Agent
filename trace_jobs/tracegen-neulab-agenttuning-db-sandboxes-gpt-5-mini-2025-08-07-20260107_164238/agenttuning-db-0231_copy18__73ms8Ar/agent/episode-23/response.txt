  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I will not modify the container or run any SQL until you explicitly choose one of two options and provide the requested details. Please reply with exactly one option and the necessary information (no extra text):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what you want selected/aggregated/filtered).\n\nAfter you provide Option A details I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL probe or return the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow installation and tell me which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you choose Option B I will: install the chosen server package via apt, initialize/start the server (launching the daemon directly if systemd is unavailable), and configure root access per your instructions. Once the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for the query you request, or run it here if you permit.\n\nNext step: reply with either Option A (and include credentials + the SQL question) or Option B (explicitly permit installation, choose server package, and give root-access preference). I will not run any SQL or install a server until you explicitly instruct me to do so.",
