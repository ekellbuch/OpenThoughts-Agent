  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). Earlier checks showed no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, and no mysql socket found by a broad filesystem search. The ss command is not available in this container, so I couldn't check listening ports with ss. At this point there is still no visible local MySQL server. To proceed I need either (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port or socket, username, password, and database) plus the SQL question you want answered, or (B) permission to install and initialize a local database server here. Until I have one of those, I cannot run SQL against a database.",
  "plan": "I'll run a few more non-destructive probes to confirm there is no server listening on TCP port 3306 and to search common runtime directories for any mysql socket file. Specifically: 1) inspect /proc/net/tcp and /proc/net/tcp6 for entries using port 3306 (hex 0CEA); 2) look for any mysqld / mariadbd process names; 3) list /run, /var/run, and /tmp directories; 4) search those directories for any mysql*.sock files. These checks should confirm whether a local server is reachable via TCP or socket. After that, please provide DB connection details or permission to install/start a local server and the exact question you want answered with SQL.",
