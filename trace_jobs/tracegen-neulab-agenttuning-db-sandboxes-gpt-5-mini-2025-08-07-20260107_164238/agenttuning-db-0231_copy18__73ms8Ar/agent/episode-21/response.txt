  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket found in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Because of this, I cannot execute SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you pick one of two explicit options and provide the requested details. Reply with exactly ONE of the following options and the required information (no extra text):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (preferred):\n- Provide: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe the query goal).\n\nAfter you give Option A details I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and continue until I can give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you permit installation and state which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (and provide it) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you give Option B permission I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then run queries as you instruct. Installing will modify the container and may take a short time.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (include credentials and the SQL question) or Option B (explicitly permit installation, choose package, and give root-access preference). I will not run any SQL or install a server until you make that choice.",
