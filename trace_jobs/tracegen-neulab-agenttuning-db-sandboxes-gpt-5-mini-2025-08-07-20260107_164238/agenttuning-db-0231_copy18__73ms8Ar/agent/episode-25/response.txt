  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a database question or connection details. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two explicit options and provide the required details. Do not include anything else in your reply besides the chosen option and its details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe the data to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nWorkflow for Option A: Once you provide credentials and the question I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either provide the next single SQL probe or deliver the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you permit installation and tell me which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you permit Option B I will run these steps (only after you confirm):\n1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y <chosen-server-package>\n2) initialize/start the server (use mysqld or mysqld_safe if systemd is not available)\n3) configure root access per your instructions (set password or use socket auth)\n4) run the SQL you request and iterate until the final answer can be given.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (Option A or Option B) and the required details so I can proceed. I will not install a server or execute any SQL until you explicitly instruct me to do so.",
