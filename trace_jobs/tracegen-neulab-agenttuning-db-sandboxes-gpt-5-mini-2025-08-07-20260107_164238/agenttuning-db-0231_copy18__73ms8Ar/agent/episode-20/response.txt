  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no reachable MySQL/MariaDB server in this environment: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details, so I cannot run any SQL against a database from this environment yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose one of two options. Please reply with exactly one option and the requested details (do not include extra text):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe what to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nWorkflow for Option A: After you supply credentials and the question, I will return exactly one SQL operation in the required format (a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\"). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you permit installation and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nWorkflow for Option B: If you permit installation, I will install and initialize the chosen server package, start the server in this container, configure root access per your instructions, and then produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block) for whatever query you request. Installing a server will modify the container and may take a short time.\n\nNext step: Reply with either Option A (and include credentials + the SQL question) or Option B (explicitly permit installation, state server choice, and root-access preference). I will not run any SQL or install a server until you provide one of these options and the necessary details.",
