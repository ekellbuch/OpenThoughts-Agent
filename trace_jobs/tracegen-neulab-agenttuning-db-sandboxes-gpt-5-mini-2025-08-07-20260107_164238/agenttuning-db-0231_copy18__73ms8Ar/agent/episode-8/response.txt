There is no MySQL server available in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket, and no listener on port 3306. There are also no credentials (no /root/.my.cnf and no relevant env vars). Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two paths before I proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if TCP), username, password (or indicate no password), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered.\n\nOnce you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can produce the Final Answer in the exact required pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local database server in this container (I will modify the container):\n- If you permit, I will install a server (mariadb-server or mysql-server via apt), initialize it, start it, and either set a root password or configure socket authentication. After the server is running I can run queries directly.\n- Tell me which server you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server) and whether to set a root password (if yes, provide it) or to use socket auth.\n\nPlease reply with one of the options and the necessary details. I will not run any SQL until you either provide DB connection details (Option A) or explicitly permit me to install and start a local server (Option B).",
