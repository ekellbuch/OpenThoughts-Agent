  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no reachable MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket found, and no listener on port 3306. There are no credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose one of two explicit options and provide the required details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (preferred):\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if TCP; default 3306), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL block in markdown). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either provide the final answer (Action: Answer) or give the next single SQL probe.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you permit installation and tell me which server package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server) and whether to set a root password (provide it) or use socket auth.\n- If you permit, I will: install the server via apt, initialize/start it appropriately for a container, secure/configure root access per your instruction, and then run SQL queries. Once running I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute or will execute it here if you permit.\n\nIf you choose Option A, include credentials and the SQL question. If you choose Option B, confirm installation and provide preferences. I will not run any SQL or install a server until you explicitly instruct me to do so.",
