  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no reachable MySQL/MariaDB server: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket in common locations, and no listener on port 3306. There are no saved credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any database connection details. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose exactly one of the two options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed. Do not include anything else in your reply besides the chosen option and its details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe what data to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nWorkflow for Option A: once you provide connection details and the SQL question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL probe or return the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow me to install and initialize a local server and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you choose Option B I will: install the chosen server package via apt, initialize/start the server appropriate for this container environment, configure root access per your instructions, and then run the SQL you request. After the server is running I will produce a single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute (or run it here if you permit).\n\nSecurity note: If you provide credentials, ensure you are comfortable sharing them here. I will only use them to connect and run the SQL statement you request.",
