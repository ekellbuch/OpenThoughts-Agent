  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible in this container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket file, and no listener on the default port. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. I cannot run any SQL against a database until I either get remote connection credentials or you permit installing and starting a local server in the container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear paths:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (preferred if available):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if TCP), username, password (or confirm no password), and the target database/schema name (if relevant).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n- After you supply these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either give the Final Answer or provide the next single SQL probe.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Confirm explicitly that you allow me to install and start a local server and tell me which package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server).\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password). Note: starting a server may require additional initialization steps and a brief wait.\n- If you permit installation, I will: install the server package via apt, initialize/start the server, secure or configure root access per your instructions, and then run the SQL you request.\n\nImportant: Once you provide connection details or permit server installation, I will follow your instructions and then produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you specified (Action: Operation and one-line SQL in a markdown code block). I will not run any SQL or install a server until you explicitly provide credentials or permission.",
