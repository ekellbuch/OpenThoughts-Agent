  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). I performed multiple non-destructive checks: no mysqld/mariadbd process found, /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist, no mysql socket found under common runtime dirs, and no TCP listener on port 3306 was detected. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. Therefore there is currently no reachable MySQL server to run SQL against from this environment.",
  "plan": "I cannot execute SQL until you choose one of two explicit paths. Please reply with exactly one of the options below and provide the requested details (no extra text):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe the data to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nIf you choose Option A I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can provide the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow installation and state which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide the password) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you choose Option B I will run these steps after your confirmation:\n1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y <chosen-server-package>  # install server\n2) initialize and start the server (use the distribution's init or run mysqld/mysqld_safe directly if systemd is unavailable)\n3) configure root access per your instruction (set provided password or enable socket auth)\n4) create or inspect databases/tables as needed and then produce a single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute or execute it here if you permit.\n\nTell me exactly ONE of the options (Option A or Option B) and include the required details so I can proceed. I will not install a server or run any SQL until you explicitly instruct me which option to take and provide credentials or installation consent.",
