  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server available in the container: no mysqld/mariadbd process, no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql socket found, and no listener on port 3306. There are no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no environment variables referencing MySQL. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database from here until I either (A) receive remote connection details or (B) am permitted to install and start a local database server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice. You must pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details. I will not run any SQL until you either provide DB credentials and the SQL question (Option A) or explicitly permit installation and starting of a local server (Option B).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if TCP), username, password (or indicate none), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"Find the top 5 customers by total orders in orders table\").\n\nAfter you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can produce the Final Answer in the exact required pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Confirm you want me to install a server and tell me which package you prefer: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide it) or to use socket authentication (no password). If you choose passwordless socket auth, I will use the root Unix socket to connect.\n\nIf you permit installation, I will run these (non-final list) steps:\n1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server)  # installs server\n2) initialize/start the database service (systemctl may not be available in container, so I may run mysqld_safe or mysqld directly)\n3) secure the installation as requested (set root password or keep socket auth)\n4) connect with mysql client and run the SQL you request.\n\nPlease reply with one of the options and the necessary details. If you choose Option A, include the SQL question and credentials. If you choose Option B, explicitly confirm installation, the server choice (mariadb-server or mysql-server), and whether to set a password (and provide it if yes).",
