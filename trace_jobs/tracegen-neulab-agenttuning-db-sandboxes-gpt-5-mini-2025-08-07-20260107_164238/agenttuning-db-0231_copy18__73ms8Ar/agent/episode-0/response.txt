  "analysis": "The shell is at /app in a container with no prior MySQL commands executed. There is no visible database output yet. To answer questions using SQL I must first locate a running MySQL/MariaDB server and credentials (if any), or confirm the socket/port and available client. Currently nothing has been checked: we need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, where its socket is, and whether a ~/.my.cnf or environment variables provide credentials. After that I can run SQL statements as requested.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current working directory and common MySQL directories to find files and socket. 2) Check running processes for mysqld. 3) Check for a root ~/.my.cnf that may contain login credentials. 4) Query the mysql client version to ensure the client is present. Based on the results I'll attempt to connect and then run the SQL you request. The commands below probe the system and should not modify anything.",
