  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). Multiple checks confirm there is no MySQL/MariaDB server accessible here: no mysqld/mariadbd process, /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld are absent, no mysql socket found in /run, /var/run, or /tmp, and no listener on TCP port 3306 was detected. There are also no stored credentials (/root/.my.cnf missing) and no MySQL-related environment variables. You have not provided a SQL question or any connection credentials. As a result I cannot run any SQL against a database from this environment until you either supply remote DB connection details or explicitly permit installation and startup of a local database server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose exactly one of the two options below and provide the required details. Do not include other text in your reply — just the chosen option and its details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (preferred):\n- Provide: host (or Unix socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or indicate empty), and database/schema name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe what to SELECT/aggregate/filter).\n\nAfter you provide Option A details I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\nYou will execute that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until I can give the final answer in the exact Final Answer pattern.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (will modify the container):\n- Explicitly confirm you allow installation and state which package to install: mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- Tell me whether to set a root password (provide it) or to use socket authentication (no password).\n\nIf you permit Option B I will: install the chosen server package via apt, initialize/start the server (launching the daemon directly if systemd is not available), configure root access per your instructions, and then run the SQL you request. After the server is running I will produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute or run it here if you permit.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (Option A or Option B) and the required details so I can proceed.",
