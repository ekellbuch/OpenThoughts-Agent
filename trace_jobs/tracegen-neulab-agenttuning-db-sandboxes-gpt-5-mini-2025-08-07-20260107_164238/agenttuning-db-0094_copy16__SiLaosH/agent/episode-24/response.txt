  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process and no /var/run/mysqld socket was found earlier). No external database connection details or SQL question have been provided. All preparatory steps (apt-get update and installing default-mysql-client) completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "You must choose how to proceed so I can produce SQL statements in the exact format you requested. Choose one of the two options and supply the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- After you provide that, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block; you will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize/create database(s)/user(s) as needed, then produce one SQL statement per round in the required format for you to run.\n\nNotes:\n- If you provide credentials, be mindful of secrets. Example client invocations (for your use once I give SQL):\n  - TCP: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n  - Socket: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (and include full connection details and the SQL question) or Option B (which server to install and whether/what data to load). I will not run further commands until you make that choice.",
