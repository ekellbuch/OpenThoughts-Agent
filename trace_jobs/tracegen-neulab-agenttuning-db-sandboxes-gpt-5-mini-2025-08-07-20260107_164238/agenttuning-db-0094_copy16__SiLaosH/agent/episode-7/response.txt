  "analysis": "You are in a container (Ubuntu 24.04) with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no MySQL server running locally and you have not supplied any external database connection details or a SQL question yet. I have prepared the environment (installed default-mysql-client) but no SQL has been executed against any database because we don't have a target DB or query to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed and provide the required details. Two clear options:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what columns, filters, aggregation, sorting, limits, etc.).\nAfter you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (see your rules: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL block). You will run that SQL and return the MySQL output; we will iterate as needed.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Tell me whether you want sample data loaded (if so, provide the data or a description of the schema and sample rows) or whether to initialize an empty DB and I'll create example data.\nIf you confirm, I'll install and start the server, create a database/user as needed, and then proceed to run queries. Each round I will provide exactly one SQL statement for you to run.\n\nConnection examples and what I'll need when you choose Option A (examples only — do not run these until you confirm):\n- TCP connection example: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n- Socket connection example: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n\nWhen you provide the connection details and the specific question, I'll produce the first SQL statement in the required format. If you want me to set up a local server, confirm which server (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to load data.\n\nNext action: Please choose Option A or Option B and provide the required details (connection info + question, or server choice + data instructions).",
