There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process or /var/run/mysqld socket was found earlier) and you have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. All package-install steps completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will not make any further changes until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested details so I can produce the single SQL statement per your workflow:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- After you provide that, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Tell me whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server (note: systemd may not be present, so I may start mysqld directly), create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then proceed. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nWhen you are done and want a final (non-operational) answer, tell me and I will output exactly:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (include full connection details and the SQL question) or Option B (which server to install and whether/what data to load).",
