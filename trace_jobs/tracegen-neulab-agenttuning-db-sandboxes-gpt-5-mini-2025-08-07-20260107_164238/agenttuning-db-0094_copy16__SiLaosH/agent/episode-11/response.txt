There is no MySQL server running locally (no socket or mysqld process detected), and you have not provided any external database connection details or the SQL question to answer. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one of the two options below and provide the requested information so I can produce the single SQL statement per round in the exact format you require.\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\n- I will then output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format: \n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here and whether to load sample data (if so, provide the data or schema and sample rows).\n- If you confirm, I will: apt-get install the server package, initialize/start the service, create database/user as needed, and then run queries per your requests. Each round I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the same required format) for you to execute.\n\nConnection examples (do not run until you confirm credentials):\n- TCP: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n- Socket: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection info + SQL question for Option A, or server choice + data instructions for Option B). Once you do, I will produce the first single-line SQL statement in the exact required format.",
