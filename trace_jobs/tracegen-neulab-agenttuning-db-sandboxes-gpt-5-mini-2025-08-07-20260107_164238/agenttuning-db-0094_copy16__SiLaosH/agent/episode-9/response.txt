  "analysis": "The container is ready: Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running locally and you have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. No SQL has been executed because there is no target database to connect to yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how you want to proceed. Provide one of the following so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Give connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Give the exact question you want answered (what data, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Tell me whether to load sample data (and provide the data or schema and sample rows) or to initialize an empty DB.\n\nWorkflow and constraints I will follow once you provide details:\n- Every time I operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. We will iterate until the question is answered.\n- When you want the final answer (no more DB operations), instruct me and I will output:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you choose Option A, a sample client invocation you can run (example only — do not run unless you provide/confirm credentials):\n- TCP: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n- Socket: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the SQL question. Once you do, I will produce the first single-line SQL statement in the exact required format.",
