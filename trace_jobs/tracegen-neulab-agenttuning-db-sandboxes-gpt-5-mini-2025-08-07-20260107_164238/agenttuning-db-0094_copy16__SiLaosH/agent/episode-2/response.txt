To run SQL from this environment we need a MySQL client (or you must provide external DB connection details). Nothing has been changed yet.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL-compatible client so I can connect to a database or run local queries if you want to create a local server later. After installation I'll verify the client is available and then wait for you to (A) provide the SQL question and connection details (host, port, user, password, database) so I can run queries against your DB, or (B) tell me to install a server and load data locally. Commands: 1) apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client to install a MySQL client. 3) mysql --version to verify installation.",
