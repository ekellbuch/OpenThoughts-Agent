  "analysis": "The environment is Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running locally and you have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. No SQL has been executed against any database because there is currently no target DB to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the required information: \n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\nAfter you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block). You will run that SQL and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether to load sample data (provide the data or a schema and sample rows if you want specific content).\nIf you confirm, I will install and start the server, create a database/user if needed, and then proceed to run queries. Each round I will provide exactly one SQL statement for you to execute.\n\nNotes about the one-statement-per-round workflow:\n- Every time I provide SQL it will be exactly one statement in a single markdown code block prefixed by: Action: Operation\n- You must execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw mysql output\n- When you want the final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the requested details (connection info + question, or server choice + data instructions).",
