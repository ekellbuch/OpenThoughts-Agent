  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is currently no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process or socket was found earlier) and you have not provided any external database connection details or the SQL question to answer. All preparatory package-install steps completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is no target database to connect to yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information. After you choose, I will perform the corresponding steps and (per your workflow) produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s)/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- Once you provide those, I will output a single SQL statement per round prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block. You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm installation, I will: apt-get install the server package, initialize/start the server (may run mysqld directly if systemd is not present), create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then proceed. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nNotes about the SQL/interaction format I will follow when operating:\n- Every time I provide SQL it will be exactly one statement inside a single markdown SQL code block prefixed by: Action: Operation\n- You must execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output\n- When you want the final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will produce: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the requested details (connection info + the SQL question for Option A, or server choice + data instructions for Option B). If you want me to proceed now to install a local server, say which server to install and whether to load any data.",
