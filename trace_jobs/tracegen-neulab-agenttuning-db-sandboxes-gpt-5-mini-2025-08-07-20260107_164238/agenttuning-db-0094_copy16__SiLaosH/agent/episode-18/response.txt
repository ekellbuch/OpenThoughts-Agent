There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no mysqld process or /var/run/mysqld socket was found), and you have not supplied any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. All package installation steps completed without error. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options and provide the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server (note: systemd may not be present so I may start mysqld directly), initialize a database/user as needed, and then proceed to run queries. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nWhen you are done and want a final (non-operational) answer, tell me and I will output exactly: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary connection details and the SQL question (for Option A) or server choice and data instructions (for Option B).",
