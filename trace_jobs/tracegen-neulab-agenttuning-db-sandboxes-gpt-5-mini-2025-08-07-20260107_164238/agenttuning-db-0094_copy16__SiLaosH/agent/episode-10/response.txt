  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). I have checked the filesystem and processes: there is no MySQL server running locally, no mysql socket file, and you have not provided any external database connection details or the SQL question to answer. So far I have only installed the MySQL client and verified it is present; no SQL has been executed against any database because there is no target DB available yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\nAfter you provide these, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; we'll iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Tell me whether you want sample data loaded (and provide the data or schema and sample rows) or to initialize an empty DB.\nIf you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize a database/user as needed, and then proceed to run queries. Each round I will provide exactly one SQL statement for you to execute in the same required format.\n\nImportant workflow reminders I will follow once you provide details:\n- Every time I provide SQL it will be exactly one statement inside a single markdown code block prefixed by: Action: Operation\n- You must execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output\n- When you want the final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and supply the necessary connection details and the SQL question (for Option A) or confirm server choice and data instructions (for Option B).",
