  "analysis": "I inspected the container. The current working directory is /app and it's essentially empty. There is no MySQL/MariaDB server process running (ps showed none), no mysql client binary available, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no /etc/mysql config dir. Environment variables contain no DB credentials. In short: there is currently no local MySQL client or server available to run SQL against.",
  "plan": "I will first check whether a package manager is available and identify the OS so I can (optionally) install a MySQL/MariaDB client or server if you want that. After that I need you to tell me one of the following: (A) the SQL question you want answered plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database) so I can connect to your existing DB, or (B) confirm you want me to install a local database/client here so I can create/load data and run queries locally. If you choose (B) I'll install a client (or server if you request) and then proceed to run the SQL statements you provide. The next commands will simply detect package manager availability and the OS.",
