  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process and no /var/run/mysqld socket was found earlier). You have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. All preparatory package-install steps completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL yet because you haven't supplied a target database or a question. Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- After you provide those, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Tell me whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it) or to start with an empty DB.\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the server, initialize/create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then provide one SQL statement per round in the same required format.\n\nGuidance on credentials & examples:\n- TCP example (for you to run the mysql client): mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n- Socket example: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus the full connection details and the SQL question, or\n- Option B plus which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether/what data to load.\n\nOnce you provide that, I will produce the next step. I will not run further commands until you choose an option and give the required details.",
