  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier and no /var/run/mysqld socket). You have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required details. After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the precise format you requested (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). Choose one option now:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and the expected output).\n- Once you provide that info I will give one SQL statement (Action: Operation) to run. You must execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate as needed.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize/create database(s) and user(s) as needed, and then provide SQL statements per your questions (one SQL statement per round in the required format). Note: in this container I may need to start mysqld directly (systemd might not be available).\n\nSecurity and format reminders:\n- If you provide credentials, be careful with secrets; you may provide them directly for this session if you accept the risk.\n- Every time I provide SQL it will be exactly one statement in a single markdown SQL code block prefixed with: Action: Operation. I will not include extra commentary in that block. When you are done and want the final answer, tell me and I will output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A and the full connection details plus the SQL question, or\n- Option B and the server choice (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether/what data to load.\n\nI will not run further commands until you make that choice.",
