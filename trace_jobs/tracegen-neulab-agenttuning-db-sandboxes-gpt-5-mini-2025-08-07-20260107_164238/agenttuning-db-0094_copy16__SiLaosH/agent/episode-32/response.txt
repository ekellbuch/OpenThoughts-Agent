  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process or /var/run/mysqld socket was found earlier). You have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to answer. All preparatory package-install steps completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details so I can continue (I will not run any SQL until you provide connection details or ask me to set up a local server):\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s)/column(s), filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block containing the SQL to run. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server (note: systemd may not be present, so I may start mysqld directly), create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then proceed. I will still produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nWhen you are finished and want the final (non-operational) answer, tell me and I will output exactly:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details (connection info + SQL question for Option A, or server choice + data instructions for Option B).",
