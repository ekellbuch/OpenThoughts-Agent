  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (/usr/bin/mysql) is installed and usable. There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no mysqld process and no socket), and you have not provided any external database connection details or a specific SQL question to answer. No SQL has been executed against any database yet because there is currently no target DB to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how to proceed. You have two clear choices:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and the expected output).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw mysql output. We will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the data or schema and sample rows).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize a database/user as needed, and then proceed to run queries. Each round I will provide exactly one SQL statement (in the same required format) for you to execute.\n\nNotes about the workflow I will follow when you give the go-ahead:\n- Every SQL operation I provide will be exactly one statement in a single markdown SQL code block prefixed by: Action: Operation. You must execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n- When you want the final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (connection info + the SQL question for Option A, or server choice + data instructions for Option B). If you want, I can proceed to install a local server now — say which server (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to load sample data.",
