I cannot run SQL against a database until you either: (A) give me connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port or socket, user, password, database), or (B) ask me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here and (optionally) load data. Nothing has been changed to any database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and then proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an external database you control: provide connection details (host, port OR socket path, user, password, database). Once you provide that and the SQL question, I will produce one SQL statement per round in the exact required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL statement in a markdown code block on one line). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, and we'll iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Create a local database in this container: confirm you want me to install a server (I can install mariadb-server or mysql-server). If you want sample data loaded, provide the dataset or instructions. I will then start the server, create a database, and run the SQL you request. I will also provide the SQL statements in the required one-statement-per-round format.\n\nUntil you tell me which option to take and give the SQL question (and connection details if Option 1), I will not run any SQL. If you want me to demonstrate connecting locally after you provide credentials, I'll run the appropriate mysql client command next.",
