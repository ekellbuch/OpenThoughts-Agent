There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process or /var/run/mysqld socket was found earlier) and you have not provided any external database connection details or a specific SQL question to run. All preparatory steps (apt-get update and installing default-mysql-client) completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options and provide the requested details; after that I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the exact format you required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block).\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s)/column(s), filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- Example client invocation you can run locally when I give SQL: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I'll install and start the chosen server, initialize/create database(s)/user(s) as needed (note: systemd might not be available so I may start mysqld directly), and then produce one SQL statement per round for you to run.\n\nWhen you are finished and want a final (non-operational) answer, tell me and I will output exactly the required final pattern:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (and supply full connection details and the SQL question) or Option B (which server to install and whether/what data to load). I will not run further commands until you make that choice.",
