We currently do not know whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running, whether the mysql client is available, or where the socket/credentials are. Nothing has been changed yet; we need to discover the database server status and client availability so we can run SQL when you provide the question.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current working directory and listing to see if any database artifacts or scripts exist. 2) Check running processes for mysqld/mariadbd. 3) Check listening TCP sockets for a MySQL port (3306) and any socket files. 4) Look for mysql client binary and MySQL configuration directories (/var/run/mysqld, /etc/mysql). 5) Check environment variables for any DB credentials. Based on results we'll know how to connect and then wait for your specific question to run the appropriate SQL. Each command is chosen to quickly gather necessary info.",
