There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket), and you have not provided any external database connection details or the SQL question to be answered. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Provide one of the following so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and the expected output).\n\nOption B — Create a local database in this container:\n- Confirm whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Indicate whether to load sample data (if yes, provide the schema and sample rows or describe the dataset).\n\nOnce you provide the necessary details and the exact question, I will output a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL statement in a single markdown code block). You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is fully answered. If you want me to proceed now to install a server, say so and I will run the installation commands.",
