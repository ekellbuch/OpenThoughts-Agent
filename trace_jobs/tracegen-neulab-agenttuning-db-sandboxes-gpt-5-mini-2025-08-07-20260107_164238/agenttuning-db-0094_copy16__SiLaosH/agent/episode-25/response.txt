  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process or /var/run/mysqld socket detected earlier). You have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to execute. All preparatory steps (apt-get update and installing default-mysql-client) completed successfully. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths so I can proceed. Tell me which option you want and provide the required details. After you do, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the exact format you requested.\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the precise question to answer (which table(s)/column(s), filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and the expected output). \n- After you provide that, I will output a single statement per round like:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; we'll iterate until complete.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide schema/data or a description).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the server, create database/user as needed, and then produce single SQL statements per round in the same required format.\n- Note: in minimal containers systemd may not manage services, so I may start mysqld directly if needed.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also instruct me now to proceed with installing a local server and I will run the necessary commands. If you choose Option A, include credentials and the SQL question. If you choose Option B, tell me which server and whether to load data. I will not run any further commands until you make that choice.",
