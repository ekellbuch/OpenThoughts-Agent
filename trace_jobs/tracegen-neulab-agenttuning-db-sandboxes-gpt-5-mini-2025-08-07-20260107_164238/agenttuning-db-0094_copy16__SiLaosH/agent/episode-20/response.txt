  "analysis": "The environment is an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process or socket), and you have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to execute. All prior steps were to prepare the client; no SQL operations have been performed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed so I can produce the single SQL statement per round in the exact format you required. Please pick one of the two options and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\nAfter you provide those, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block. You will run only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\nIf you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then proceed to run queries. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nWhen you are finished and want a final (non-operational) answer, instruct me and I will output exactly:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (include full connection details and the SQL question) or Option B (which server to install and whether to load data).",
