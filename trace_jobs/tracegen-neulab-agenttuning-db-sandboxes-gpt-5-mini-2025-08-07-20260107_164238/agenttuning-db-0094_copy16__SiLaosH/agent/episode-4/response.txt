I will then produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format so you can execute it and return the raw MySQL output.\n\n- If you want a local server here (Option B): confirm and say whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, and whether to initialize sample data. I will install, start the server, create a database/user as needed, and then proceed to run queries per your questions, following the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule.\n\nOnce you choose and provide the necessary details or question, I will output the next single SQL statement in the required format.",
