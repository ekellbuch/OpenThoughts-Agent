  "analysis": "You're in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process and no /var/run/mysqld socket were found earlier). No SQL has been executed because no target database or SQL question has been provided. To proceed I need either connection details for an existing MySQL server or confirmation to install and run a local server and optionally load data.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two options so I can produce the single-line SQL statements in the exact format you requested:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (specify tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- After you provide those, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, and whether to load sample data (if yes, provide the data/schema or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the server, initialize/create databases/users as needed, and then proceed. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nIf you choose Option A, a sample client invocation you can run after I give SQL:\n- TCP: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n- Socket: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p'<password>' <database>\n\nIf you choose Option B and want me to proceed immediately, reply with which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether to load data. If you choose Option A, reply with the connection details and the SQL question. I will not run further commands until you make that choice.",
