  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (/usr/bin/mysql) is installed. There is no MySQL server running here and you have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question yet. No SQL has been executed against a database because there is nothing to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. You have two main choices:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what data or aggregation you need).\nAfter you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here (I can install and start it).\n- Tell me if you want sample data loaded and provide that data or instructions.\nIf you confirm, I will install/start the server, create the database/user if needed, and then proceed to run queries per your requests. Each round I'll produce exactly one SQL statement for you to run.\n\nImportant workflow notes:\n- Every time I provide SQL it will be exactly one statement inside a single markdown code block prefixed by: Action: Operation. You must execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n- When you are ready for a final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will produce: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary connection details or the SQL question, and I will produce the next single SQL statement.",
