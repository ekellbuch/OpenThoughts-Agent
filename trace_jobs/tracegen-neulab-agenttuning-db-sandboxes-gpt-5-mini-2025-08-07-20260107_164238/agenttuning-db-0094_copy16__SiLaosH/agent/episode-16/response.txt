There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and you have not provided any external database connection details or the SQL question to answer. So far I've prepared the environment (installed the mysql client) but no SQL has been executed because there is no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and provide the requested information; after that I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\n- Example connection forms for your reference:\n  - TCP: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n  - Socket: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here.\n- Tell me whether to load sample data (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe the rows) or to initialize an empty DB.\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the server, create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then run queries per your requests.\n\nWorkflow rules I will follow once you provide details:\n- Every operation I give you will be exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block, prefixed by: Action: Operation\n- You must execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n- When you are finished and want the final answer, tell me and I will output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A plus connection details and the SQL question, or\n- Option B plus which server to install (mysql-server or mariadb-server) and whether/what data to load.\n",
