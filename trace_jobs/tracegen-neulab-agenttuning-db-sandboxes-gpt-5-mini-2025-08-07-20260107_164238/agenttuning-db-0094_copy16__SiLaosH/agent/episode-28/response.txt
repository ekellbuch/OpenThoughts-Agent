There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process and no /var/run/mysqld socket was found previously). You have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question to execute. All package installation steps completed successfully and no SQL has been run against any database because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and provide the requested information; after that I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the exact format you specified (an \"Action: Operation\" line followed by a single-line SQL code block). Options:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s)/column(s), filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and the expected output).\n- After you provide those, I will produce a single SQL statement for you to run and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the server (note: systemd may not be present so I may start mysqld directly), create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then provide one SQL statement per round for you to run.\n\nWhen you are done and want the final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will output exactly:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with Option A and the connection details plus your SQL question, or Option B and the server/data preferences, and I will produce the first SQL statement in your required format.",
