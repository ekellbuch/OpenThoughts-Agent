  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and you have not provided any external database connection details or a SQL question. No SQL has been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options and provide the requested details so I can produce the next single SQL statement in the exact format you required:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, and expected output).\nAfter you provide those, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block. You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server.\n- Tell me whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it) or to initialize an empty DB.\nIf you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize a database/user as needed, and then proceed. Each round I will provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nWhen you are done and want the final answer (no more DB operations), tell me and I will output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with Option A and the connection details plus your SQL question, or Option B and your server/data preferences.",
