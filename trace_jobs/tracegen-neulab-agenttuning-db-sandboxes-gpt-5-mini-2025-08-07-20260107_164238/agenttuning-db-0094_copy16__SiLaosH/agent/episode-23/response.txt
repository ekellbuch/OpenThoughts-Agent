  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process and no /var/run/mysqld socket was found earlier). You have not provided any external database connection details or a specific SQL question to run. All preparatory steps (apt-get update, installing default-mysql-client) completed successfully. No SQL operations have been executed because there is currently no target database to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of the two options and provide the requested details so I can continue and — per your workflow rules — generate exactly one SQL statement per round when operating:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s)/column(s), filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, expected output).\nAfter you provide that, I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw mysql output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether you want sample data loaded (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\nIf you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server (note: systemd may not be available so I may start mysqld directly), create database(s)/user(s) as needed, and then proceed. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nWhen you are done and want the final non-operational answer, tell me and I will output exactly: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (and give full connection details and the SQL question) or Option B (and indicate which server to install and whether/what data to load).",
