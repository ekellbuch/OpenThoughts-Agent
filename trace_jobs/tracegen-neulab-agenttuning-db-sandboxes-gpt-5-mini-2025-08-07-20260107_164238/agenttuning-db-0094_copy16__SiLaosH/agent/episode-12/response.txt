  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (/usr/bin/mysql) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running (no socket or mysqld process found) and you have not provided any external database connection details or the SQL question to be answered. No SQL has been executed because there is no target database available.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (specify tables/columns, filters, aggregation, ordering, limits, desired output format).\n- After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single SQL statement on one line>\n  ```\n  You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local database in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server here, and whether to load sample data (if yes, provide the schema/data or describe it).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the chosen server, initialize a database/user as needed, and then proceed to run queries. Each round I will provide exactly one SQL statement for you to execute in the same required format.\n\nNotes and examples:\n- TCP client example (for your reference): mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n- Socket example (for your reference): mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n\nOnce you choose Option A or B and provide the necessary details (and the specific question), I will output the first single-line SQL statement in the exact format you require.",
