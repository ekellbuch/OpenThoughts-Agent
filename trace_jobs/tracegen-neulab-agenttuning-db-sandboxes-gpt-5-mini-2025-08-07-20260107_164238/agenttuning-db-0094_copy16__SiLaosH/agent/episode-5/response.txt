  "analysis": "We have an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running here and no external database connection details or a SQL question have been provided. So far I have: updated apt, installed default-mysql-client, and verified the client is present. What remains: either connect to an existing database (need connection details and the SQL question) or install and start a local database server and/or load data so we can run queries locally.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (external) MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), user, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (describe desired output or columns/filters).\nOnce you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server.\n- Tell me whether you want sample data loaded and, if so, provide the data or instructions for loading it.\nIf you confirm, I will: apt-get install the server package, initialize/start the service, create a database/user as needed, and then run queries per your requests. Each query will be provided one SQL statement per round in the required format.\n\nNotes about the workflow and constraints:\n- Every time I provide SQL to run, I will present exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block prefixed by: Action: Operation. You must execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the MySQL output. We will repeat until you are satisfied.\n- When you are done and want the final answer (not further DB operations), instruct me and I will produce: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\", ...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and give the required details (or the SQL question if you already have connection info).",
