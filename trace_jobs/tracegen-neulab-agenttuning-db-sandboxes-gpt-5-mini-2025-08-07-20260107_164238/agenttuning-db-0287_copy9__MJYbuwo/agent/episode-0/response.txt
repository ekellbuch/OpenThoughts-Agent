  "analysis": "The shell is open at a root prompt (/app) but no MySQL-related actions have been performed yet. There is no visible database output or a question from you yet. To proceed with operating a MySQL database I need to locate the MySQL server, check if it's running, find available client tools and any local credentials (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf) so I can connect and run the SQL you ask for. Nothing has been accomplished yet.",
  "plan": "I will run a short sequence of diagnostic commands to discover whether MySQL/MariaDB is installed and running, determine its version, inspect common locations for database files and potential local credentials, and list permissions. This will let me know how to connect (socket/port/credentials). After these checks I'll wait for your specific question so I can craft the exact SQL to run. Commands to run: 1) Print working directory and current user. 2) List files in current directory. 3) Check mysql client version. 4) Check processes for mysqld. 5) Check if port 3306 is listening. 6) List /var/lib/mysql contents. 7) Show /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (if present) to find maintenance credentials. 8) Grep /etc/mysql for password strings. Each command is fast; durations set small.",
