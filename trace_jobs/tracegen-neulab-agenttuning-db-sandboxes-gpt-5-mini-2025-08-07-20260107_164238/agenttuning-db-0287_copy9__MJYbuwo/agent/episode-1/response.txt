  "analysis": "I inspected the container. Current directory is /app and I'm root. There are no files in /app. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). No mysqld processes are running, port 3306 is not listening, /var/lib/mysql is empty or missing, and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf was not found. In short: there is no local MySQL client or server to operate on from this shell right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the specific database question you want answered and (if applicable) the method I'll use to run SQL: either you will execute SQL statements I provide against your MySQL instance and return the raw MySQL output, or you will provide connection details so I can connect. Because this environment lacks a MySQL client/server, I cannot execute SQL here. Next steps: 1) You give the question and indicate whether you'll run the SQL I send or provide connection credentials. 2) I will think through and explain the approach, then either (a) produce a single SQL statement in the required markdown format for you to execute, or (b) if you allow me to operate (provide credentials), I'll run SQL and iterate based on the returned output. I will not run any SQL locally until you confirm how you'll supply results.",
