The server socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't specified any SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready for SQL operations.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact SQL task you want me to perform. Please choose one precise action (or state your own):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in <database>\" — tell me the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; \n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — tell me db.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>; \n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT; \n- \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact change (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you specify the action I will: 1) briefly explain my approach and any assumptions, and 2) if I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (begin with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL code block on one line). You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze and continue.",
