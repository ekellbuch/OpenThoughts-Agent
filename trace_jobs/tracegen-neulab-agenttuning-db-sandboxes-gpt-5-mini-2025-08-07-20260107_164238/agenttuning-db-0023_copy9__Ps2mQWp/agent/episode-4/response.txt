  "analysis": "Summary of current state: A MySQL/MariaDB client was not present initially but has been installed. MariaDB server package was installed and the server was started manually using mysqld_safe / mariadbd. The server process is running (mariadbd) and the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and is owned by mysql:mysql. A test connection as root succeeded and SHOW DATABASES returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. What has been accomplished: installed mysql client, installed mariadb-server, created /run/mysqld, started the server, and verified that we can run SQL queries. What still needs to be done: you (the user) need to ask the specific SQL question you want answered against this database, or tell me which SQL operation to perform next (e.g., list tables in a database, query a particular table, modify data, create users, etc.). I am ready to run further SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific question or next SQL operation. When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain the approach and any assumptions. 2) If I choose to operate, I will produce exactly one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block (markdown) as required, and I will also provide thoughts and expected result. 3) You will execute the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. 4) I will analyze the output and either continue with another operation or, if finished, provide the final Answer in the specified format. If you want me to run a preliminary SQL to inspect schema (for example, SHOW DATABASES or SHOW TABLES in a specific DB), tell me which database or say 'inspect schema' and I will run the next SQL command. If you want me to proceed now to list databases/tables, say so and which database to inspect.",
