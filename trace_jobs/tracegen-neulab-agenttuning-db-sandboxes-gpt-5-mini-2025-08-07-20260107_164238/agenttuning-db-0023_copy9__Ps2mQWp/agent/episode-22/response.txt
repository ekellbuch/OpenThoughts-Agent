This is appropriate if you want me to populate a database and then run queries.\n2) Restore or load a provided SQL dump (you would provide the dump file or contents). I can run SOURCE or mysql < dump.sql to import.\n3) If you expected existing data, provide the database name or dump; otherwise confirm you want me to create a schema and populate it and tell me the schema and sample data or the queries you want answered.\n\nWhen you choose, I will either: A) Operate — produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block with one line) for you to execute and return the result; or B) Answer — if you're asking for guidance only, I will provide the final answer. Tell me which option and the specifics (database name, table schema or dump, or the query you want answered).",
