  "analysis": "The environment currently does not have a MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables, no root ~/.my.cnf, and no /var/lib/mysql directory present. That indicates the container doesn't host a MySQL server data directory locally, and we can't run SQL yet because the client is missing and likely no server is running here. To proceed I need to install a MySQL/MariaDB client, then check whether a MySQL server is running (local process or listening on port 3306) and attempt a connection (SHOW DATABASES). Depending on the connection error, we'll adjust (provide host/credentials or stop if no server is accessible).",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package so we can run SQL commands (apt-get update and install default-mysql-client). 2) Verify the client installation (mysql --version). 3) Check for a running MySQL/MariaDB server process and whether anything is listening on port 3306. 4) Attempt a simple SQL query (SHOW DATABASES) as root without a password to see if a local socket-based connection works or returns an authentication/connection error. Each command's purpose is to enable and then test SQL access so I can run further SQL statements as you requested.",
