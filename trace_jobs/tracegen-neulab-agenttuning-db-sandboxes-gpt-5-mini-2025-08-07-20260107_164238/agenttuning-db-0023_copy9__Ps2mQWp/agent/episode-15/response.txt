No application databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not specified a SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready to run SQL commands.",

Please tell me exactly which operation you want (pick one or provide your own precise instruction):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in <database>\" — give the database name and I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; \n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — give db.table and I'll run DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>; \n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT; \n- \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact change (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you pick an action I will: 1) explain my approach and assumptions, and 2) if I operate, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze and continue.",
