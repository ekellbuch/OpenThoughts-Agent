  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. The server socket exists at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and a test query returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or tables have been inspected yet — the environment is ready for SQL operations but no specific SQL question or operation has been provided by you.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific question you want answered from the database. Examples of possible requests: - List databases - List tables in a database (you must name the database) - Show rows from a table with a condition (provide table and condition) - Count/aggregate data (specify table and columns) - Modify data or schema (describe the desired change)\n\nWhen you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my approach and any assumptions. 2) If I choose to operate, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block on one line). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. 3) I will analyze that output and continue with further operations or produce the Final Answer using the exact format you requested.\n\nIf you are unsure what to ask, I can start by listing non-system databases or listing tables in a particular database (for example: SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;). Tell me which action you want.",
