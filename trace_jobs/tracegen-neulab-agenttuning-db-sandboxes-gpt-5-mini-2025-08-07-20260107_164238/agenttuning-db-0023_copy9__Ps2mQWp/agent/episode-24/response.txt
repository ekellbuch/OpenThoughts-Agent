  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd). The mysql client is available and can connect via the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). A query to list non-system databases returned no rows, so there are currently no user/application databases present. In short: the SQL environment is ready, but there is no application data to inspect yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Choose one clear option (or provide your own precise instruction):\n\n1) Create a new database and example schema here so we can run queries — tell me the database name and, optionally, table names/columns (or say \"create example schema\").\n2) Load a SQL dump you provide — tell me where the dump file is located in the container or paste its contents.\n3) If you expected existing data, provide the database name and I will list tables (I would run SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;).\n4) Run a specific SELECT/aggregation/query — provide the database, table, columns, and any WHERE clause.\n5) Modify schema/data — provide exact changes you want (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER).\n\nWhen you pick one option, I will: (a) explain assumptions and approach briefly, and (b) if operating, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (begin with \"Action: Operation\" and include one SQL code block containing a single SQL statement on one line). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze that output and continue or provide the final Answer in the exact format you requested.",
