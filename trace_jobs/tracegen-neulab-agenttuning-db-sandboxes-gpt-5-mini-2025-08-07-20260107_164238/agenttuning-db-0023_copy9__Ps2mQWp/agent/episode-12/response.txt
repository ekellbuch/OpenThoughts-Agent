Please tell me one precise operation from the following or provide your own: \n- \"List all databases\" (I will run SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in <database>\" (tell me the database name; I will run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;)\n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" (tell me db.table; I will run DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;)\n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" (provide table, columns, WHERE clause; I will run a single SELECT)\n- \"Modify schema/data\" (provide exact change and I will prepare the appropriate ALTER/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)\n\nWhen you specify the action I will: 1) explain my approach and any assumptions, and 2) output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output so I can continue.",
