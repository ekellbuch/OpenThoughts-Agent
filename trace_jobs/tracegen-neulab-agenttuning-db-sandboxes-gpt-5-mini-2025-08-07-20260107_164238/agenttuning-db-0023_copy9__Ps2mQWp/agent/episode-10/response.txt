The server socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query previously returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or data have been inspected because you haven't provided a specific SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready to run SQL commands interactively.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact SQL task you want performed. Options you can pick (or provide your own precise request):\n- \"List all databases\" (I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in <database>\" (tell me the database name; I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;)\n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" (tell me db.table; I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;)\n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" (provide table, columns, and WHERE clause; I'll run a single SELECT)\n- \"Modify schema/data\" (provide exact change and I will prepare the appropriate ALTER/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)\n\nWhen you pick an action I will:\n1) Briefly explain my approach and any assumptions.\n2) If I choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block (one line). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze that output and continue or provide the final answer in the exact format you specified.\n\nTell me which of the above actions (or a different precise SQL request) you want me to perform next.",
