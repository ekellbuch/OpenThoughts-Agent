The socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test SHOW DATABASES; returned only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). A query to list non-system databases returned no rows, so there are currently no user/application databases present. The environment is ready to run SQL, but you have not specified which SQL action or question you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give a clear instruction. Please tell me exactly which action you want from the options below (or provide your own precise request):\n\n1) \"List all databases\" — I'll run SHOW DATABASES;.\n2) \"List tables in <database>\" — provide the database name and I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;.\n3) \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — provide db.table and I'll run DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;.\n4) \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT.\n5) \"Create example schema\" — I'll create a sample database/table and insert sample rows so you can ask queries against it.\n6) \"Import SQL dump\" — provide the dump path or contents and I'll import it.\n\nWhen you pick one action I will: (A) explain assumptions and approach briefly, and (B) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You will run only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer in the exact format you requested.",
