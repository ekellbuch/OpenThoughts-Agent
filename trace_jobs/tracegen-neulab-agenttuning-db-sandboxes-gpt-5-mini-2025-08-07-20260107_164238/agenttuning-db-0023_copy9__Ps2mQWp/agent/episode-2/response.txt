  "analysis": "We now have the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running on this container: attempts to connect to the local socket failed (ERROR 2002). /var/lib/mysql did not exist earlier, and ps showed no mysqld process. To run SQL queries we must have a running server to connect to. The next step is to install and start a database server in this container (MariaDB or MySQL), then connect with the mysql client and run SQL.",
  "plan": "1) Install a database server package (mariadb-server) so a local server is available. 2) After installation, check for a running mysqld process. The package install typically initializes the data directory and attempts to start the server. 3) If the server is running, connect with the mysql client and issue a simple query SHOW DATABASES; to confirm access. 4) If authentication prevents access (root password), we'll inspect logs or restart with --skip-grant-tables to reset root credentials, but we'll proceed stepwise and react to errors after seeing the outputs.",
