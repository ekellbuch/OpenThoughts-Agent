To proceed usefully (since you haven't specified a particular database or query), I'll create a small example database and table with sample data so you can request queries against it or I can demonstrate typical operations. This will let us run SELECTs, DESCRIBE, and other queries against a concrete schema.",
  "plan": "1) Create a new database named sample_db. 2) Create a table sample_db.employees with columns id, name, department, salary. 3) Insert three sample rows into employees. 4) Verify by listing tables in sample_db. 5) Show the rows inserted. Each step will use the mysql client and run a single SQL statement.",
