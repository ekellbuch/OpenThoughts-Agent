A test query previously returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready to run queries via the mysql client, and socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact SQL task you want performed. Examples you can pick or adapt:\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in <database>\" — tell me the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; \n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — tell me db.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>; \n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT; \n- \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact change (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you specify which action to perform, I will: 1) explain my approach and assumptions briefly, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output so I can analyze it and continue.",
