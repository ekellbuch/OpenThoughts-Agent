  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. The server socket (/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) exists and a test SHOW DATABASES; returned only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). A query to list non-system databases returned no rows, so there are currently no user/application databases present. The environment is ready for SQL work but there is no application data to inspect yet.",
  "plan": "I need your direction about what you want done next. Pick one precise option (or provide your own):\n\n1) Create a new database and schema here so we can run queries (tell me the database name and table schemas or let me create a simple example schema).\n2) Load a SQL dump you provide (tell me where the dump file is or paste its contents) and then run queries against it.\n3) If you expected an existing database, provide its name and I will inspect it (I can run SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; or DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; — tell me which).\n4) Run a specific query you want (tell me the question, the target database/table, and any conditions).\n\nWhen you choose an option, I will: 1) explain assumptions and approach briefly, and 2) if I operate, produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw output, I will analyze it and continue or give the final answer.",
