The server socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a previous test query returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready to run SQL commands; the only remaining step is for you to tell me exactly what query or change you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give a precise instruction. Please tell me one specific action from the examples below (or provide your own precise SQL task):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in <database>\" — tell me the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — tell me db.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT;\n- \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact change (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you specify the action I will: 1) explain my approach and assumptions briefly, and 2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line) for you to execute. You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and continue or provide the final answer.",
