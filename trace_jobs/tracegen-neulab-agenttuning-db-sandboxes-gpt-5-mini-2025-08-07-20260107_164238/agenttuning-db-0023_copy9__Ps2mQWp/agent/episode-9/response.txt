The socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a prior test (SHOW DATABASES) returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases/tables have been inspected because you haven't specified any SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready for SQL operations.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which SQL action you want me to perform. Pick one of the following (or provide your own precise request):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in <database>\" — tell me the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; \n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — tell me db.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; \n- \"Show CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>\" — tell me db.table and I'll run: SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>; \n- \"Run a SELECT on <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a SELECT; \n- \"Modify data/schema\" — provide the exact change you want (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you choose, I will: 1) explain assumptions and approach briefly, and 2) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block on a single line). You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze and continue.",
