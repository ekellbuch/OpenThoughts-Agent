  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd). The mysql client is installed and working. The server socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query previously returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet specified a SQL question or operation. The environment is ready to run SQL commands.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which SQL action you want me to perform. Pick one precise action (or provide your own):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in <database>\" — tell me the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — tell me db.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT;\n- \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact change (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you specify the action I will: 1) briefly explain my approach and any assumptions, and 2) if I operate, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (begin with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL code block on one line). You should execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output so I can analyze it and continue.",
