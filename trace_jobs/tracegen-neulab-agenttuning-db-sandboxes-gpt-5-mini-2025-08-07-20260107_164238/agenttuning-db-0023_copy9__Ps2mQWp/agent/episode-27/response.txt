  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd). The mysql client is available and can connect via socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). A query to list non-system databases returned no rows, so there are currently no user/application databases present. No application tables or data have been inspected because you have not specified a SQL question or provided a database/dump to work with.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want done next. Pick one clear option (or provide your own):\n1) List all databases (I will run SHOW DATABASES;). \n2) List tables in a specific database (tell me the database name; I will run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;). \n3) Describe the schema of a table (tell me db.table; I will run DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;). \n4) Run a SELECT query (tell me database, table, columns, and WHERE clause; I will run a single SELECT). \n5) Create an example database and table(s) here (tell me the database name or say 'create example schema') and I will create and populate it so you can query it. \n6) Import a SQL dump you provide (tell me where the dump is or paste it). \n\nWhen you choose one action, I will: (A) explain my approach and any assumptions, and (B) if operating, produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output so I can analyze it and continue.",
