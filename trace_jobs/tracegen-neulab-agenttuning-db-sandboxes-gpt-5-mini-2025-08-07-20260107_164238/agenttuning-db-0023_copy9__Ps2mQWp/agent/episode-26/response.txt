  "analysis": "MariaDB (mariadbd) is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. The server socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). A query to list non-system databases returned no rows, so there are currently no user/application databases present. No further SQL has been executed because you have not specified what you want queried or changed. The environment is ready for SQL operations.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which SQL action you want me to perform. Choose one precise option (or provide your own):\n\n1) \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES; \n2) \"List tables in <database>\" — provide the database name and I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; \n3) \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — provide db.table and I'll run: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n4) \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT;\n5) \"Create example schema\" — tell me a database and table schema (or say create a simple example) and I'll create a database/table and insert sample rows so you can query them;\n6) \"Import SQL dump\" — provide the dump file path or contents and I will import it and then run queries against it;\n7) \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact ALTER/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE you want executed.\n\nWhen you choose, I will: (A) briefly explain assumptions and the approach, and (B) if I operate, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (begin with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the result and continue or give the final answer in the required format.",
