The server socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not specified any SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready for SQL queries.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact SQL task you want performed. Pick one precise action or provide your own instruction. Examples you can request (choose one):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in mydb\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;\n- \"Describe schema of mydb.mytable\" — I'll run: DESCRIBE mydb.mytable;\n- \"Show CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable\" — I'll run: SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable;\n- \"Select rows from mydb.mytable where id=5\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE id=5;\n- \"Insert/Update/Delete or ALTER\" — describe the exact change you want.\n\nWhen you specify the action I will: 1) explain the approach and assumptions, and 2) if operating, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). Execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output so I can analyze and continue.",
