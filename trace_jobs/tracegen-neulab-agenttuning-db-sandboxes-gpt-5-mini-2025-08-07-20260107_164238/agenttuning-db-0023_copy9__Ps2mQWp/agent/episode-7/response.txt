The server process (mariadbd) is running, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES) previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected yet because you haven't asked a specific SQL question. The environment is ready to run SQL but I need you to tell me what query or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the question. Possible next steps you can request (pick one):\n- List all databases: I'll run SHOW DATABASES; to see available databases.\n- List tables in a specific database: tell me the database name and I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;.\n- Inspect the schema of a table: tell me db.table and I'll run SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; or DESCRIBE db.table;.\n- Query data: tell me the table, columns, and any WHERE condition and I'll run a SELECT accordingly.\n- Modify data or schema: describe the exact change and I'll run the appropriate ALTER/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.\n\nWhen you choose an action, I will: 1) explain my approach and assumptions, 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation and a single SQL code block on one line) for you to execute, and 3) await the raw MySQL output to continue.",
