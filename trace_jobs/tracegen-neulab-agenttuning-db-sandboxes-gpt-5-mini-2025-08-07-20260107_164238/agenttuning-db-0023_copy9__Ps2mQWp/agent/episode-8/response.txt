  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. The server process (mariadbd) is active, the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES) previously returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet specified what you want queried or changed. The environment is ready to run SQL, but I need the specific question or operation to proceed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Pick one of these or provide your own precise request: \n- \"List all databases\" (I'll run SHOW DATABASES;). \n- \"List tables in <database>\" (tell me the database name; I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;). \n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" (tell me db.table; I'll run DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>; depending on your preference). \n- \"Run a SELECT on <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" (give table, columns, WHERE). \n- Modify schema/data (give exact ALTER/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement desired). \n\nWhen you specify the action, I will: 1) briefly explain my approach and any assumptions, and 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block on one line). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.",
