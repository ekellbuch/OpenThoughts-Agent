  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mariadbd process is active) and the mysql client is available. A socket exists at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and a test query SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. In short: the environment is ready for SQL operations. Nothing else has been queried yet (no application databases or user tables have been inspected).",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific question you want answered from the database (for example: list tables in a database, show rows from a table with a condition, aggregate/query data, create/modify data, manage users, etc.). Once you give the question I will: 1) Explain my approach and any assumptions. 2) If I choose to operate, I'll produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block in one line). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. I'll analyze that output and either continue with another operation or, when finished, produce the final answer using the exact Answer format you specified. If you want me to inspect schema first, tell me which database to inspect (or say 'inspect schema' to list databases and then tables).",
