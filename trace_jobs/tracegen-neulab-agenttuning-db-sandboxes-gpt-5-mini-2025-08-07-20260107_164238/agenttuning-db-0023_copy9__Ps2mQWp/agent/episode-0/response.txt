  "analysis": "You are in a shell on the container (root@c6e48bd63da4:/app#). No MySQL-related actions have been taken yet. To help with SQL operations I need to discover whether the mysql client is available, whether a server is running, and any credentials (root password or a client config file) so I can connect and run SQL. The next step is to probe the environment and attempt a connection so I can list databases and then proceed with SQL queries once I know how to connect.",
  "plan": "1) Check environment variables for any MYSQL_* credentials. 2) Check whether the mysql client is installed and its version. 3) Look for a client config file (~/.my.cnf) that may contain credentials. 4) Inspect /var/lib/mysql to see if a server data directory exists. 5) Attempt to run a simple SQL command (SHOW DATABASES) using the mysql client as root without password. Depending on the output, we'll adjust and supply credentials if needed. Each command is chosen to reveal connection options and server presence so we can run SQL next.",
