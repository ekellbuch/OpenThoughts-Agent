A socket exists at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and a test query already returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases/tables have been inspected because you haven't specified a SQL question or operation yet. The environment is ready to run SQL commands.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact SQL task you want performed. Options you can pick (or provide your own precise request):\n- \"List all databases\" — I'll run SHOW DATABASES;.\n- \"List tables in <database>\" — tell me the database name and I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;.\n- \"Describe schema of <database>.<table>\" — tell me the db.table and I'll run DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; or SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;.\n- \"Select rows from <database>.<table> with condition <...>\" — provide the table, columns, and WHERE clause and I'll run a single SELECT.\n- \"Modify schema/data\" — provide the exact change (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER) and I'll prepare the SQL.\n\nWhen you choose an action I will: 1) explain my approach and assumptions, and 2) if I operate, I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement on one line). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze and continue.",
