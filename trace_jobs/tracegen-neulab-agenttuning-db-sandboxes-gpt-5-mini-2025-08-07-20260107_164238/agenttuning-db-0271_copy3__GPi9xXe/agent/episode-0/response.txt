I need to inspect the system to find whether MySQL/MariaDB is installed and running, and to attempt a connection so I can run SQL for your upcoming questions. The terminal currently shows no database output; nothing has been accomplished yet. Next steps are to check for a mysql client, see running processes, check the MySQL socket directory, and try a simple SQL (SHOW DATABASES) to discover what databases exist.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to confirm environment. 2) Check running processes to see if a mysqld server is running. 3) Check whether a mysql client is available (mysql --version). 4) Inspect the usual MySQL runtime directory (/var/run/mysqld) for a socket. 5) Attempt to connect as root without a password to run a simple SQL: SHOW DATABASES; This will show available databases so I can plan subsequent SQL operations. If the connection fails, we'll adjust based on the error.",
