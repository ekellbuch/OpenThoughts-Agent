No mysqld process is running (ps output shows no mysqld). Nothing has been accomplished yet toward being able to run SQL against a MySQL/MariaDB server. To run SQL I must first install a server and/or client and start the server so I can connect with the mysql client.",
  "plan": "Install MariaDB server and client packages, ensure the mysqld runtime directory exists and is owned by the mysql user, start the mysql service (or mysqld), then verify the mysql client is available and run a simple SHOW DATABASES; to confirm the server is running and accessible. Commands: 1) apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) Install mariadb-server and mariadb-client noninteractively. 3) Create /var/run/mysqld and set ownership so the server can create a socket. 4) Start the mysql service. 5) Check mysql client version and run SHOW DATABASES; to confirm connectivity.",
