  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no MySQL server accessible from this environment: no local Unix socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) and no mysqld process. No credentials or client config with connection defaults were found. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide any requested details, and I will produce the next action (either the single SQL operation block you must execute or the commands to install/start a local server):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended): provide connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), user, password (or indicate no password), and database (optional). After you provide them I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to run; you will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will proceed.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container: confirm you want me to install and start mysql-server here, and tell me whether to set a root password (or use no password), and whether to create any initial user/database. If you confirm, I will run the install/init/start steps and then produce the SQL operation block you want executed.\n\nOption C — Provide a SQL dump or database file: upload or indicate the path to a dump in the container and tell me what queries you want run after import; I will import and then produce the SQL operation block.\n\nTell me which option you choose and include any required connection values or confirmations. Once you do, I will prepare the exact next-step commands or the single SQL code block per your workflow requirements.",
