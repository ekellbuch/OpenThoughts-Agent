  "analysis": "The container is ready: mysql client (8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running. Root authenticates via the Unix socket (auth_socket) and can run queries without a password. Only system databases exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is no application data or remote connection information provided, so no application-level SQL has been run to answer a question yet. The shell is idle at /app awaiting your next instruction.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly how you want to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote MySQL server: provide host, port (default 3306 if omitted), user, password (or indicate no password), and database name, and state the question or the exact SQL you want run. I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server in this container:\n  B1) Import a SQL dump: provide the dump file path in the container and the target database name (I will import then produce the SQL operation you request).\n  B2) Create sample data locally: specify schema and sample rows (or ask me to create a simple example) and I will create/populate it and then produce the SQL operation you request.\n  B3) Inspect the local server: give a local database name or request an inspection command (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; DESCRIBE db.table; or a SELECT). I will then produce a single-line SQL statement for you to run as root via the local socket.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact single SQL statement to run on the local server: paste it here and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation format.\n\nAfter you choose and provide any necessary details, I will either run preparation steps (for imports/creation) or output exactly one SQL statement in the required format. Reminder: when I output an operation it will look exactly like:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<one-line SQL statement>;\n```",
