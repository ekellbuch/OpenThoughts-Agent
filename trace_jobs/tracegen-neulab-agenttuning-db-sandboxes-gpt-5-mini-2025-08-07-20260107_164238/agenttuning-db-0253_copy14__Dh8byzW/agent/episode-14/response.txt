  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server (mysqld) and the mysql client (8.0.44). Root connects via the local Unix socket (auth_socket) and only system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application data or remote connection details have been provided, so I cannot run any application-level SQL to answer a question yet. The shell is idle at /app awaiting your instructions.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one of these options and provide any required details; I will then either run preparation commands or produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions:\n- Option A (preferred if you have an existing DB): Provide remote connection details (host, port if non-default, user, password or indicate no password, and database) and state the question to answer. I will produce a single-line SQL statement inside the Action: Operation markdown block for you to run.\n\n- Option B (use local server): Tell me to create/import data locally. Suboptions:\n  1) Provide a SQL dump path in the container to import, or\n  2) Ask me to create a sample database/table and populate it (specify schema/data or say to create a simple example), or\n  3) Give a local database name to inspect (I can run SHOW TABLES / SELECT as a single SQL operation).\n\n- Option C: If you already know the exact SQL you want executed on the local server, paste it and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation single-line SQL block.\n\nOnce you pick an option and provide any necessary details, I will proceed. Remember: when I request an operation I'll output exactly one SQL statement in this format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n(only the SQL in the first SQL code block will be executed). After you run it and paste back the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze and continue or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.",
