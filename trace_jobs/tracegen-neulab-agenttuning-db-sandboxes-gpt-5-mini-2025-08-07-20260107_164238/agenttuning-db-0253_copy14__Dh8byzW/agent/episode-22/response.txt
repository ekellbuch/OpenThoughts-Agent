  "analysis": "The container is ready: mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running. Root connects via the local Unix socket (auth_socket) and can run queries without a password. Only system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is no application data and you have not provided a remote DB or a dump to import, so I cannot answer an application-level question yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me which action you want next. Choose one of the options below and provide the requested details; after you do, I will either run preparatory shell steps (if you ask me to create/import data locally) or produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\n1) Query a remote/external MySQL server (preferred if your data is remote)\n   - Provide: host, port (omit for 3306), user, password (or indicate no password), database (optional), and the question or the exact SQL you want run.\n   - I will produce: Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block to run against that server (you will execute it and return output).\n\n2) Use the local MySQL server in this container\n   - 2A: Import a SQL dump into local server — provide the dump file path and target database name; I will run the import and then produce the SQL operation you want.\n   - 2B: Create sample data locally — tell me the schema and sample rows (or say to create a simple example) and I will create and populate it, then produce the SQL operation you want.\n   - 2C: Inspect local server — give a local database name or request an inspection command (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; DESCRIBE db.table; or a SELECT). I will produce a single-line SQL statement for you to run as root via the socket.\n\n3) You already know the exact SQL to run locally\n   - Paste the single SQL statement and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nNotes about the workflow\n- When I request an operation I will output exactly one SQL statement in this format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <one-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  Only the SQL in the first SQL code block will be executed by you. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze it and either ask for another operation or finish with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\", \"...\"]\n\nIf you are unsure, I recommend Option 2B (I can create a small example database/table so you can see queries working) or Option 1 if your data is remote. Tell me which option you choose and provide any required details now.",
