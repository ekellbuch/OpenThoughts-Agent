Before running any SQL (which per your instructions should be sent in a separate SQL block later), I need to detect whether a MySQL server is present, whether the mysql client is available, any relevant environment variables or files, and whether a MySQL process is running so I can decide how to connect.",
  "plan": "1) Check basic context (user, cwd). 2) Look for MySQL-related environment variables. 3) Check for mysql client binary and its version. 4) Inspect common MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and running processes for mysqld. 5) If mysql client exists and server appears running, attempt a simple connection test (mysql -u root -e 'SELECT VERSION();'). I will not issue any SQL inside this sequence; the SQL operations are to be done later in the required SQL block flow. The commands below will gather information so we can decide how to proceed with SQL operations.",
