  "analysis": "You are in a container (Ubuntu 24.04). I installed the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) successfully. There is no local MySQL server running: no /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, no mysqld process, and no credentials found in /root/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql. Thus I cannot execute SQL against a database yet because there is no reachable server or credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice of how to proceed. You can pick one of these options:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one): provide connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database). Once you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation markdown block (one-line SQL). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container: if you confirm, I will (1) install mysql-server, (2) initialize/start the server, (3) create any users/databases you require, and then run SQL you request. This will take multiple apt and service commands. If you choose this I will proceed and present the commands I will run in the next step.\n\nOption C — Provide a database dump file or other credentials you want me to load or query; I can then import and run SQL.\n\nIf you choose Option A, give: host, port (optional), user, password (or say no password if applicable), and database (optional). If you choose Option B, confirm you want me to install and start a local server and specify any initial root password or user/database to create.\n\nNote about the SQL workflow I will follow once connected: I will output exactly one SQL statement per operation in this format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n(only the SQL inside the first SQL code block will be executed by you). After you run it and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze and continue or produce the final answer using:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the requested details so I can proceed.",
