  "analysis": "The environment is ready with the mysql client installed, but there is no MySQL server accessible from this container and no credentials/configuration found. I cannot execute any SQL until you either provide connection details for an existing server or ask me to install and start a local server here. The terminal is idle at /app awaiting your next instruction.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options:\n\n- Option A (connect to existing server): Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), user, password (or indicate no password), and database (optional). After you provide them, I will produce a single SQL operation in the exact format you requested (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.\n\n- Option B (start a local server here): Confirm that you want me to install and start mysql-server in this container. Also tell me any initial root password, or say to use temporary/no password and any database/user to create. If you confirm, I will run the installation and initialization commands and then proceed to run SQL per your workflow.\n\n- Option C (provide a dump/file): Upload or indicate a SQL dump or file you want loaded here and queried; provide the filename and desired queries.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the required details so I can craft the next command (or the SQL operation block) exactly as your workflow requires.",
