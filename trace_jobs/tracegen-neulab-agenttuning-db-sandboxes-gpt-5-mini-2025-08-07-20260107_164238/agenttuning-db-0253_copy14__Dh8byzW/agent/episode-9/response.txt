  "analysis": "We currently have the mysql client installed in the container (mysql 8.0.44) but no MySQL server is running or accessible: no /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, no mysqld process, and no credentials/config found. To be able to run SQL against a database from this shell we need a running MySQL server (local or remote) and credentials. Since you haven't provided remote connection details, the most direct next step is to install and start a local MySQL server in the container so we can run SQL here.",
  "plan": "1) Install the mysql-server package so a server is available locally. 2) Start the MySQL service (try the service wrapper). 3) Verify a Unix socket exists and that we can connect as root via the socket. 4) Run a simple test query SELECT VERSION(); to confirm the server is running and reachable. If the service start fails we will try to start mysqld directly. After this succeeds, you can instruct me what SQL operation to run; per your workflow I'll then produce a single-line SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nCommands below perform the install, attempt to start the server, and test connectivity.",
