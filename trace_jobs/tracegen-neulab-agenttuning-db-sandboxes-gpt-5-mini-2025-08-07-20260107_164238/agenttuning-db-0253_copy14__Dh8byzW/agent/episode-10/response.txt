The Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and connecting as root without a password succeeds. mysql client version 8.0.44 is available. At this point we can run SQL against the local server. I do not yet know the specific question you want answered or what database/tables to query, so I will first enumerate the existing databases and list MySQL user accounts so we understand the environment before proceeding.",
  "plan": "1) List all databases to see what data is present. 2) List user accounts from the mysql.user table to know available users and authentication plugins. After you review that output, tell me the question you want answered (e.g., which table/columns to query or what derived results you need). Then I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the exact Action: Operation markdown format you requested for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
