  "analysis": "MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running in the container. Root authenticates via auth_socket and can run queries without a password. Only the default system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is no application data, no remote connection info, and you have not yet specified a question or next action, so no SQL operation has been executed against application data.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly how you want to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host, port (omit or 3306 if default), user, password (or say no password), and database (optional). Also state the question or the exact SQL you want run. Once you provide these, I will output a single SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server in this container:\n- B1) Import a SQL dump: give the dump file path in the container and target database name (I will run the import and then produce the SQL operation you request).\n- B2) Create sample data: specify schema and sample rows (or say to create a simple example) and I will create/populate it, then produce the SQL operation you request.\n- B3) Inspect local server: give a local database name or tell me what to inspect (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; or SELECT ...). I will then produce a single-line SQL operation for you to run as root via the socket.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact single SQL statement to run on the local server:\n- Paste the single statement and I will wrap it in the exact Action: Operation format required.\n\nImportant: After you choose and provide details, I will produce exactly one SQL statement wrapped like this:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<one-line SQL statement>;\n```\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or finalize with Action: Answer and Final Answer.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply any needed connection details, dump path, schema/data, or the exact SQL to run.",
