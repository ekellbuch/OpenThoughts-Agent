  "analysis": "We installed the MySQL client successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock does not exist and mysql -uroot can't connect via socket. At this point we can run the mysql client, but we have no server to talk to and we lack any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). Before issuing any SQL, we should check for local client config files that might contain connection defaults or credentials (e.g., /root/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/my.cnf) and also check environment variables. If no credentials/config are found, you will need to provide the connection details or a database dump, or we could attempt to start a local MySQL server (which requires more steps).",
  "plan": "1) Look for local MySQL client configuration and credential files: check /root/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and list /etc/mysql to find included config files. 2) Search for any files with .cnf or .my.cnf in the top-level filesystem to find possible credentials. 3) Check environment variables for MYSQL/MARIA/DB related variables. 4) Based on the findings, either attempt a connection using discovered defaults or ask you to provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) so I can produce the single-line SQL statement per your execution rules. The commands below perform these checks.",
