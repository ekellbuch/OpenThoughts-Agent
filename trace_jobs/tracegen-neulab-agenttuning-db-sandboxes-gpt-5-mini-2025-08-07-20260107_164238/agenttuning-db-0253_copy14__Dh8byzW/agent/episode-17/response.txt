  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) and the mysql client. Root connects via the local Unix socket (auth_socket) with no password. Only the default system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is no application data and you have not yet provided a question, remote connection details, or a dump to import. Therefore I cannot run any application-level SQL to answer a question until you specify what to do next.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me which of the following you want me to do next. After you choose and provide any needed details I will produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation markdown block (one-line SQL) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or I will run shell steps to prepare the local DB as requested.\n\nOptions (pick one and provide details):\n- Option A (query remote DB): provide host, port (optional), user, password (or indicate no password), database name, and the question (or the exact SQL you want run).\n- Option B (use local DB): choose one:\n  B1) Import a SQL dump — provide the dump filepath and target database name.\n  B2) Create sample data — describe schema and sample rows or say to create a simple example and I will initialize it.\n  B3) Inspect local server — provide a local database name or request a command such as SHOW TABLES or DESCRIBE table.\n- Option C (you already have SQL): paste the exact single SQL statement you want executed on the local server and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation format.\n\nOnce you respond with your choice and the necessary details, I will either run the preparatory shell commands locally (if you request data creation/import) and then produce the SQL operation block, or immediately output Action: Operation with a single-line SQL statement for you to run. I will not run any SQL until you provide that instruction.",
