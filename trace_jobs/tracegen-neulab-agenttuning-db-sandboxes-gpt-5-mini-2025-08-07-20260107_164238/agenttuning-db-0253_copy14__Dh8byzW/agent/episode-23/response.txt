  "analysis": "The container is ready for database work: mysql client (8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running. Root connects via the local Unix socket (auth_socket) with no password. Only the default system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no application databases or tables present and you have not provided remote connection details or a SQL dump. Therefore I cannot run any application-level SQL to answer a question yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me which action you want next. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details; after you do I will proceed and either run preparatory steps locally or produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (choose one and give details):\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), user, password (or state no password), database (optional), and the question or the exact SQL you want run.\n\n2) Use the local MySQL server in this container:\n   a) Import a SQL dump — provide the dump file path in the container and target database name (I will import and then run queries as requested).\n   b) Create sample data locally — specify the schema and sample rows or say to create a simple example (I can create a sample database/table and populate rows so you can test queries).\n   c) Inspect the local server — give a database name (if any) or request a command such as SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; DESCRIBE db.table; or a SELECT statement to run.\n\n3) You already have the exact single SQL statement to run locally — paste it here and I will wrap it in the exact Action: Operation format for execution.\n\nNotes about workflow once you choose:\n- When I perform an operation I will output exactly one SQL statement in this format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n  ```\n  Only the SQL inside the first SQL code block will be executed by you. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze it and either request another operation or finish with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required connection details, dump path, schema/data, or the specific question to answer. If you want, I can immediately create a sample database and table (tell me a name) and then produce the first SQL to inspect it.",
