  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running locally. The mysql client (8.0.44) is available and root can connect via the Unix socket (root is authenticated with auth_socket). Current databases are only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables were found yet. Therefore there is no application data to query until either (a) you provide connection details for a remote database, (b) you ask me to create/load data into this local server, or (c) you specify what existing database/schema to inspect (if any).",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the question you want answered or choose one of these options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing remote database: provide host, port (if not 3306), user, password (or indicate no password), and database. Once you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block) for you to execute; you will return the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nOption 2 — Work with the local MySQL server: tell me whether to (a) create/import a database (provide a dump or specify schema/data), or (b) create a sample database/table and insert data to run queries against, or (c) you already have a database name here for me to inspect—if so tell me the database name and I will produce a single-line SQL operation to examine it (e.g., SHOW TABLES or SELECT). Note: when I produce SQL to execute it will be run as root via the local socket (no password needed).\n\nOption 3 — If you already have a specific SQL question (e.g., \"Which customers made purchases in January?\") simply state it and, if it refers to your remote DB, provide connection details. I will then craft the precise single-line SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation markdown block.\n\nWhen you choose an option, I will either:\n- Output Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block (this is the only SQL that will be executed by you), or\n- Run the requested shell steps to create/import data locally, then output the SQL operation.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any needed details (connection info, database name, or sample data/dump).",
