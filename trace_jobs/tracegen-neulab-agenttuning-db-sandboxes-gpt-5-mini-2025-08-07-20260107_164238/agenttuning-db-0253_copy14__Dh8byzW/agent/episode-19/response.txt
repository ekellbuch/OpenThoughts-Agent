  "analysis": "MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running in the container. Root can connect via the local Unix socket (auth_socket) without a password. Only system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and there is no application data present. You have not yet provided a question, remote connection details, or a dump to import, so I cannot run any application-level SQL to answer a specific question yet. I have verified connectivity by running SELECT VERSION() and SHOW DATABASES; these confirmed the server is up and reachable.",
  "plan": "I will not run further shell commands until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide any required details so I can produce the exact single SQL statement (in the Action: Operation markdown format you specified) or run preparation steps if needed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote MySQL server: provide host, port (default 3306 if omitted), user, password (or indicate no password), and database name, and describe the question or SQL you want run. I will then produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server in this container:\n  B1) Import a SQL dump: upload or place the dump file in the container and give its path and target database name; I will import it and then produce the SQL operation you request.\n  B2) Create sample data locally: specify the schema and sample rows (or ask me to create a simple example); I will create/populate it and then produce the SQL operation you request.\n  B3) Inspect the local server: give a local database name or request a command (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; DESCRIBE db.table; or a SELECT). I will produce a single-line SQL statement for you to run as root via the local socket.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact single SQL statement to run locally: paste it and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nAfter you pick an option and supply the necessary details, I will either run preparatory shell steps (for imports/creation) or output exactly one SQL statement in this format:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<one-line SQL statement>;\n```\nRemember: only the SQL in the first SQL code block will be executed by you; after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze it and either request another operation or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.",
