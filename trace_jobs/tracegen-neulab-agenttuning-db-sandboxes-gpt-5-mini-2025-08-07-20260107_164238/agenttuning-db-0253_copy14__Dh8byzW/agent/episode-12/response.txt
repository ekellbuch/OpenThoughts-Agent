  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running locally in the container. The mysql client (8.0.44) is available. Current MySQL state: only system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and root authenticates via auth_socket (no password required when connecting locally as root). No application databases or tables are present to answer application-level queries yet. The shell is ready for further actions.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you tell me what you want done. Please choose one of the following options and provide any required details, then I will produce the exact single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions:\n1) Query a remote/external database you control — provide connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password or indicate no password, and database). I will craft a single SQL statement to run against that DB.\n\n2) Work with this local MySQL server — choose one:\n   a) Create/import a database/dump here (provide a dump file path or tell me to create sample data). If you want a dump imported, upload or place it in the container and give its path; I will then import or create schema and proceed.\n   b) Create a sample database/table and populate it so we can run queries (specify schema/data or ask me to create a simple example).\n   c) Inspect a specific database already present here (provide the database name); I can then produce a single SQL statement (for example SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; or SELECT ...) for you to execute.\n\n3) If you already have a specific question (e.g., \"List customers who purchased X between dates Y and Z\"), describe it and indicate whether it refers to the local server or a remote one. If remote, include connection details.\n\nOnce you choose, I will either:\n- If you want a local action (create/import), run shell commands to prepare the database and then produce the single SQL operation block for you to run, or\n- If you want to query (local or remote), produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute and return output.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (connection info, dump path, sample data schema, or the specific question).",
