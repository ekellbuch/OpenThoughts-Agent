  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server (mysqld) and the mysql client (8.0.44). Root connects via the local Unix socket using auth_socket, and only the default system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is currently no application data or remote connection information provided, so I cannot run any application-level SQL query yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly how you want to proceed. Choose one of the following and provide any required details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) database: provide connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password or note if no password, and database name) and state the question or the exact SQL you want run. I will then produce a single-line SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server here: tell me whether to (1) create/import a database/dump (if so, provide the dump path or upload it), (2) create a sample database/table with example data (specify schema/data or say to create a simple example), or (3) inspect a specific local database (give the name). After you choose, I will either run shell commands to prepare the database or produce the single SQL operation block for you to execute.\n\nOption C — If you already have a specific question (e.g., \"list customers who purchased X between dates Y and Z\"), state the question and indicate whether it refers to the local server or a remote one; if remote include connection details.\n\nOnce you tell me which option and supply any necessary details, I will either:\n- Run the required shell steps to prepare the environment (if needed), then output Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block for you to run, or\n- Directly output Action: Operation containing the single SQL statement to execute against the specified server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the requested connection details, dump path, or the specific question to answer.",
