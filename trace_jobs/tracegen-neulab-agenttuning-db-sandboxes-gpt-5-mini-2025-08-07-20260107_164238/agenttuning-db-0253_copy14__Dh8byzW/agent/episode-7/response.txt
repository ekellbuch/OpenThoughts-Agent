  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server accessible: no local socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, no mysqld process, and no credentials in /root/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql. The terminal is idle at /app awaiting further instructions. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following actions. Tell me which you want and provide any requested details; I will then proceed and produce the single SQL code block (Action: Operation) when an operation is to be executed.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host, port (optional, default 3306), user, password (or indicate no password), and database (optional). After you provide them I will craft a single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to run. You will execute it and paste the raw MySQL output back, and I will analyze it and continue or finish.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and start mysql-server here. Also specify any initial root password or indicate use of no password, and any user/database you want created. If you confirm, I will run the commands to install, initialize, and start the server, create users/databases as requested, and then produce the SQL operation block you want executed.\n\nOption C — Provide a SQL dump or database file to load:\n- Upload or indicate the location of the dump file in the container and what queries you want run after import. I will import it and then produce the SQL operation block.\n\nNotes on the SQL workflow I will follow once connected or a server is running:\n- For each operation I will output exactly one SQL statement in this format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n\n- The SQL must be a single line and only the SQL in the first SQL code block will be executed by you. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or finish with:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (connection info, confirmation to install server, or dump location).",
