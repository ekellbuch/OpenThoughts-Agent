At this point we can run the mysql client from this shell, but we still do not know where the target MySQL server is (local socket, localhost:3306, or remote) nor do we have credentials. Before issuing any SQL against a database I need to know connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or confirm a local server is available.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether a local MySQL UNIX socket exists (common path /var/run/mysqld). 2) If socket exists attempt a quick connection as root without a password to get the server version (this will indicate whether a local server is running and whether anonymous/no-password root access is allowed). 3) If that fails, report the failure and request connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or the SQL you want executed so I can provide the exact SQL block per your execution rules.",
