  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client or server installed or running. The prompt is at /app as root. Attempts to find mysql binaries, environment variables, running mysqld processes, and MySQL data directory returned nothing. To run SQL against a MySQL server from this shell we first need a mysql client binary. The target MySQL server (local or remote) and credentials are not yet known; installing a client will allow executing SQL statements once connection details are provided.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect OS release to choose the appropriate package manager. 2) Update package lists. 3) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client or mariadb-client) so we can run 'mysql' to execute SQL statements. 4) Verify mysql client is now available. After this, I'll wait for you to provide the MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or the SQL you want executed. Commands below install the client and verify it is present.",
