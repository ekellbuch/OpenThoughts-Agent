  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running. Root can connect via the local Unix socket (root uses auth_socket). Only the default system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and there are no application databases or tables present. No remote server credentials or database dumps have been provided. The environment is ready to run SQL, but I need your instruction about which database to use or what data to create/import and the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "You must tell me which of these actions you want next. After you choose, I will either run preparation commands (if you ask me to create/import local data) or I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL inside the first SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output. Choose one of the options below and provide any required details:\n\nOption A — Query a remote/external MySQL server: provide connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password or indicate no password, and database name) and state the question or the exact SQL to run. I will then output a single SQL operation block for you to execute against that server.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server here:\n  B1) Import a SQL dump into the local server: provide the dump file path in the container (or upload it) and the target database name. I will import it and then produce the SQL operation block you request.\n  B2) Create sample data locally: tell me the schema and sample rows (or ask me to create a simple example), and I will run the necessary SQL to create/populate it, then produce the SQL operation block you request.\n  B3) Inspect the local server: give a database name (if any) or request actions like SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE table, or SELECT queries; I will output one SQL operation block to run as root via the local socket.\n\nOption C — You already know the exact SQL to run on the local server: paste that SQL (single statement) and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nImportant: When I produce an operation it will look exactly like this:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n(Only the SQL in the first SQL code block will be executed by you. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze and either request another operation or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.)\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (connection info, dump path, schema, or the specific question).",
