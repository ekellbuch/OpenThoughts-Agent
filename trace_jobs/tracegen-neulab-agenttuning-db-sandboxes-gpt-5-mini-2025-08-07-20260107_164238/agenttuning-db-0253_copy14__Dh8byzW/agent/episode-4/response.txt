  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server accessible from this container: no local Unix socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, no mysqld process, and no credentials found in /root/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql. I cannot run SQL against a database until I have an accessible MySQL server and credentials (host, port, user, password, database) or a running local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL yet. I need you to choose one of the following options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server you control: provide connection details (host, port — default 3306 if omitted, user, password, database). Once you provide them I will produce a single SQL statement in the exact format you required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You must execute the SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either ask for another operation or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container: if you want that, confirm and I will install and initialize a local server (this will take additional steps and time). If you choose this, I will run apt-get install mysql-server, initialize, start the service, create a user/database as needed, then run the SQL you request.\n\nOption C — Provide a SQL dump file or sqlite export to load here and query.\n\nNotes about how I will operate when you choose to proceed:\n- Every time I request an operation I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown code block like this:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;\n```\n- The SQL must be one line and will be executed only once (only the first SQL code block will be run by you). After you run it and return the raw MySQL output I will analyze it and either request another operation or produce the final answer\n- If I decide to finish I will produce:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and, if Option A, provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database), or if Option B confirm starting a local server. If you prefer, tell me the exact question you want answered and any schema/context so I can craft the first SQL to run.",
