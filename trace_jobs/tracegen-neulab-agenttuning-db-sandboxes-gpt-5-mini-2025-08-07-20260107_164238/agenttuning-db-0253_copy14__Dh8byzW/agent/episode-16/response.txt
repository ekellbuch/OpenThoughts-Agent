  "analysis": "The container is running Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running. Root authenticates via the Unix socket (auth_socket) and can run queries as root without a password. Current databases are only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no application databases or tables present. No remote connection details or database dumps have been provided. The environment is ready to run SQL, but I need your instruction about which database to use or what data to create/import and the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction on how to proceed. Choose one of the following and provide any required details:\n\nOption A — Query a remote MySQL server: provide host, port (optional, default 3306), user, password (or indicate no password), and database name, plus the question or the exact SQL to run. I will then produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation markdown block for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server in this container:\n  B1) Import a SQL dump: provide the dump file path and target database name; I will import it and then produce the SQL operation block you request.\n  B2) Create sample data locally: provide the desired schema/sample rows or say to create a simple example; I will run the necessary shell/SQL steps to create and populate it and then produce the SQL operation block.\n  B3) Inspect local server: give a local database name (if any) or request an inspection command (e.g., SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE table); I will produce a single-line SQL statement for you to run as root via the socket.\n\nOption C — If you already know the exact SQL to run on the local server, paste it here and I will wrap it in the required Action: Operation format for execution.\n\nNotes about workflow: When an operation is requested I will output exactly one SQL statement in the exact format you required:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<one-line SQL statement>;\n```\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or conclude with:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (connection info, dump path, schema, or the specific question).",
