  "analysis": "The container is ready for database work: the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and a local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0.44) is running. Root can connect via the Unix socket (auth_socket) without a password. Current databases are only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no application databases/tables present and you have not provided any remote connection details or a SQL dump to import. Therefore no application-level SQL query has been executed to answer a user question yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction about which action to take next. Choose one of the following and provide any required details, and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote MySQL server: provide host, port (default 3306 if omitted), user, password (or indicate no password), and database name, plus the question or exact SQL to run. I will then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Use the local MySQL server in this container:\n  B1) Import a SQL dump: upload or place the dump file in the container and give its path and the target database name; I will import it and then produce the SQL operation you request.\n  B2) Create sample data locally: tell me the schema and sample rows you want (or say to create a simple example) and I will create/populate it and then produce the SQL operation you request.\n  B3) Inspect the local server: give a local database name or request an inspection command (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; DESCRIBE db.table; or a SELECT). I will then produce a single-line SQL statement for you to run as root via the socket.\n\nOption C — If you already have the exact single SQL statement to run on the local server, paste it and I will wrap it in the exact Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nReminder of the workflow I will follow when performing an operation:\n- I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown code block preceded by \"Action: Operation\". The SQL must be a single line and will be executed only once (only the SQL in the first SQL code block will be run). After you execute it and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another operation or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and a Final Answer array.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required details (connection info, dump path, schema/data, or the specific question).",
