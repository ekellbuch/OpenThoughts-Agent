  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container as root at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no credentials or .my.cnf were found. No SQL has been run against any database because no connection details or question have been provided.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you provide either: (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, username, password, database) plus the exact question/query you want answered, or (B) explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server here (and a root password or permission to auto-generate one), or (C) the schema/dump and the question so I can craft SQL for you to run elsewhere. Please choose one option and supply the required details. Once you do: - If you provide connection details (A) and want me to connect from this container, I will run the mysql client and then produce a single Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a one-line SQL code block for you to execute (I will only execute the SQL you permit). - If you ask me to install a local server (B) I will install, initialize and start it, then proceed with SQL operations one statement at a time. - If you want only the SQL crafted (C), provide the schema and question and I will return the single-line SQL statement in the required format.",
