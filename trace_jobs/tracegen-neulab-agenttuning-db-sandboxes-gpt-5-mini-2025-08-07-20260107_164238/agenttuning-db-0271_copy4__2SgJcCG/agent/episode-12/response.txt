Please pick one of these options and provide the required details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also indicate whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client (I will run the client) or whether you prefer I only provide the SQL for you to run.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install, initialize, and start the server, then connect and run SQL statements as needed.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement in the required one-line SQL code block for you to execute.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and include the required details. After that I will either: (1) run environment commands here (if you permit connecting/installing), or (2) output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block for you to run and return the output, or (3) output Action: Answer when we are finished.",
