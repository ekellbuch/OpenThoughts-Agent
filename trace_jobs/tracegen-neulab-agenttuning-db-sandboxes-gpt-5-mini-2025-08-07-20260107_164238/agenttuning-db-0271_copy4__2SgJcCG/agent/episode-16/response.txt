  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, and no mysqld process was found earlier) and no credentials or .my.cnf were discovered. No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I am waiting for you to choose how to proceed and to provide the necessary information.",
  "plan": "I will not run further shell commands until you tell me which of the following you want to do and provide the requested details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- You provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modification).\n- If you want me to connect from this container, I will run a one-shot mysql client command like:\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\"\n  (I will only run the exact SQL you authorize and will produce it in the required single-line SQL code block format.)\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server and provide a root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install and initialize the server (apt-get install mariadb-server or mysql-server), start it, secure it, then connect and run SQL statements as you request (one statement per interaction).\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question.\n- I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement (in the SQL code block format you required) for you to execute and then return the raw MySQL output for analysis.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and include the required details. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, indicate whether I should use an interactive mysql session or a one-shot -e invocation. Once you provide that, I will produce the next Action according to your protocol: either a single SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) or, if finished, Action: Answer with Final Answer.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also paste a database dump or the schema here and I will load it locally after installing a server.",
