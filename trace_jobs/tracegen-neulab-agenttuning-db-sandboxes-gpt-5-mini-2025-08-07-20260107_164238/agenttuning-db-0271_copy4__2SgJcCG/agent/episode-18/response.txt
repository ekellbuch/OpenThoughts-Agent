  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process found earlier) and no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or environment variables were found. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I cannot run SQL against any database yet without further information or permission to install/start a server here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the three ways to proceed and provide the required details. After you provide that, I will follow your protocol (each operation: a single SQL statement in one SQL code block; when finished: Action: Answer with Final Answer array). Choose one option and provide the specifics below:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide these connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (table(s) involved, columns, filters, aggregations, or modification to perform).\n- Also indicate whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client (I will then run one-shot mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\") or whether you prefer I only craft the SQL for you to run remotely.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and supply a root password or allow me to auto-generate one.\n- I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then connect locally. After that I will issue SQL statements one at a time (Action: Operation) per your rules.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the database schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question. I will produce the single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to run in your environment and return results.\n\nWhen you reply, include the option you choose and the requested details. Once I have that, I will either run environment commands (if you permit connecting/installing) or output the next Action according to your protocol. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, explicitly confirm that I should use the installed mysql client and provide credentials. If you choose Option B, confirm installation of a local server and give or allow a root password.",
