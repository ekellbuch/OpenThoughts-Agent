  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, and no mysqld process was found earlier) and no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables are present. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I am awaiting your instruction on how to proceed.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the three options below and provide the requested details so I can continue. I will follow your required interaction protocol: for operations I will output Action: Operation and include exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until I produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Tell me whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client (I will run a one-shot mysql command) or whether you only want the SQL crafted for you to run remotely.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one). Also state a preference for mariadb-server or mysql-server if you have one.\n- If confirmed I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then connect locally and run SQL statements one at a time per your rules.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute in your environment and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nWhen you reply, state which option you choose and include the required details. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, include credentials and confirm I should use the installed mysql client. If you choose Option B, confirm installation and provide or allow a root password. If you choose Option C, provide the schema and the question.",
