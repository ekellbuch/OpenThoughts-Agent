  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed in this container (mysql 8.0.44). There is still no MySQL server or database connection configured here: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysqld process, and no .my.cnf or environment credentials were found earlier. No SQL statements have been executed against any database yet. I cannot proceed to run SQL until you provide either connection details to an existing MySQL server or permission to install and run a local server (or provide a SQL dump and schema).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and provide the needed information:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote/external MySQL server you control:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name, and the exact question (what table/columns/filters/aggregations or modification you want).\n- I will then output a single Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iterating until we can produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here:\n- Tell me to install and initialize a local server. I will install the server package, initialize it, set a root password (you must provide or I will generate one), start the server, and then connect. After that I will issue SQL statements in the required single-statement-per-step format.\n\nOption C — You want me only to craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to run against your database and return the output.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option and give the required details. If you choose Option A, also note whether I should use the mysql client here to connect (I will run a mysql command) or just produce the SQL for you to run remotely. If you want me to proceed with installing and running a local server (Option B), confirm and provide any root password or allow me to auto-generate one.",
