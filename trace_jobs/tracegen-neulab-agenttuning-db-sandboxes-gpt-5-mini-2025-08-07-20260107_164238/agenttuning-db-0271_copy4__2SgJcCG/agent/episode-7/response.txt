  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server or any database connection configured here: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysqld process, and no credentials (.my.cnf or environment variables). No SQL has been executed against any database yet. I cannot proceed to run SQL until you either provide connection details for an existing database, provide a schema/dump to load, or allow me to install and run a local server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options and provide the necessary information. I will not run any shell commands until you tell me which option to take.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server you control:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications you want performed).\n- Once provided I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation). You will execute it (or allow me to connect from this container) and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and continue iterating.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a server and provide a root password (or allow me to auto-generate one). I will then install the server, initialize it, start it, and connect. After that I will issue SQL statements one at a time as required.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute on your environment and return the results.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the required details. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, specify whether I should use the installed mysql client to connect (I will then run the mysql client) or just produce the SQL for you to run remotely.",
