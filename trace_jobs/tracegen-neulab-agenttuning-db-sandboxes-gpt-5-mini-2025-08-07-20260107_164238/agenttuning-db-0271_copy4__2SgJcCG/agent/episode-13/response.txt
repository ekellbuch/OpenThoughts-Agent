  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and ready. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no credentials or .my.cnf were found. No SQL has been executed because no target database or task has been provided.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you choose one of the options below and provide the required information. Pick one and reply with the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also state whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client or whether you will run SQL yourself. If you want me to connect, I will run the mysql client here and then produce one SQL statement per interaction in the required format.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then proceed to run SQL statements one at a time as required.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute on your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you provide the option and the details, I will proceed. Per your protocol, each operation I request you to execute will be exactly one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block (one line). When finished I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer as required.",
