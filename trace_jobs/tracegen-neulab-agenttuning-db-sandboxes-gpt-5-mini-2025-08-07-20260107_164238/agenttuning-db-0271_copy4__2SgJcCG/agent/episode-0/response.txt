  "analysis": "You are at a root shell inside a container (prompt: root@7c529325588e:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session. There is no visible MySQL activity or connection information shown on the current terminal. To operate a MySQL database we need to locate the server/process, configuration, or credentials (environment variables or .my.cnf) so we can connect and run SQL. Right now nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to MySQL.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect basic environment and current directory to confirm we are root and where we are. 2) List likely MySQL-related directories (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) to see if MySQL data/config exists. 3) Check running processes for mysqld/mariadbd to see if a server is running. 4) Check mysql client availability (mysql --version). 5) Search environment variables and common credential files (~/.my.cnf) for connection information. Based on findings we will try to connect or request credentials. Each command is quick info-gathering and will inform the next step.",
