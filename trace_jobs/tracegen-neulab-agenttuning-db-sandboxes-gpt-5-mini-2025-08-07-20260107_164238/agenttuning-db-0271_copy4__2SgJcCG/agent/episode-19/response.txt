  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, and no mysqld process found earlier) and there are no credential files or environment variables for connecting to a database. No SQL has been executed because I have not been given a database question or connection details. I am currently waiting for you to tell me how you want to proceed (connect to an existing DB, install/run a local server here, or only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere).",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you choose one of these options and provide the required details. Choose exactly one of the following and supply the requested information:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Indicate whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client (I will then run the client here) or whether you simply want me to craft the SQL for you to run.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm that you want me to install and initialize a local server and provide a root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- If you confirm, I will install and start the server, create or load a database as directed, and then run queries.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the database schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question. I will return the exact single-line SQL statement (in the SQL code block format you required) for you to execute and return the output.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and include the necessary details. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, say so and provide credentials; I will then produce Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement (in a single-line SQL code block) for execution and analysis. If you choose Option B, confirm installation and supply/allow a root password and I will proceed. If you choose Option C, provide schema and question and I will craft the SQL for you to run.\n\nI will wait for your choice and details before taking any action.",
