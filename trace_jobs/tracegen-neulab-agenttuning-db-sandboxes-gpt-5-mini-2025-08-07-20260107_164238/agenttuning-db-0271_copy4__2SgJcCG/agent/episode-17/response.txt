  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process appeared earlier) and no credential files or environment variables were found. No SQL has been executed against any database because you haven't provided a question or connection details. I am waiting for you to choose how to proceed and to supply the required information.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me which option to take. Pick one of the following and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Tell me whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client. If yes I will execute a one-shot query like: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\". Per your protocol, before execution I will output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement (in a single-line SQL code block) and you will run it and return the raw MySQL output (or allow me to run it here).\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then connect locally. After that I will produce SQL statements one at a time (Action: Operation) as you requested.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute on your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you reply, state which option you choose and supply the required details. If you choose Option A and want me to run queries from this container, also indicate whether to use an interactive session or one-shot -e. After you provide this, I will follow your protocol: produce exactly one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block for execution (Action: Operation), then analyze the returned output and iterate until I produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.",
