  "analysis": "You are in a minimal Ubuntu container at /app with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no credentials or database files were found earlier (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql don't exist, no mysqld process, no /root/.my.cnf, no MySQL env vars). No SQL has been executed against any database because no connection details or question have been provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed and provide the necessary information. Pick one of the options below and supply the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (per your rules). You will run that SQL (or allow me to connect from this container) and return the raw MySQL output. We will iterate until complete.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then connect from this container. After that I will produce SQL statements one at a time (Action: Operation) as required.\n\nOption C — You only want SQL crafted for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement in the required markdown SQL block for you to execute on your environment and return the output.\n\nWhen you reply, state which option you choose and include the required details. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, say so and confirm I should use the installed mysql client. Once you provide the connection info and the question (or confirm server installation), I will proceed and output the next Action according to your protocol.",
