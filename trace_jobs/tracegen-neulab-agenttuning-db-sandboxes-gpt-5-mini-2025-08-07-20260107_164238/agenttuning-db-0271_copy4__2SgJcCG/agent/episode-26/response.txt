  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and usable. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and there are no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables present. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I cannot perform any database operations until you either (A) provide connection credentials to an existing MySQL server, (B) permit installation/initialization of a local MySQL/MariaDB server here (and provide or allow generation of a root password), or (C) provide the schema/dump and request SQL to be crafted for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Wait for your choice among three options and then proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- You must provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also say whether I should connect from this container (I will use the installed mysql client) or only craft the SQL for you to run. If you want me to connect, I will run a one-shot mysql command here and then follow your protocol of producing exactly one SQL statement per Action.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a root password or allow me to auto-generate one. Also indicate whether you prefer mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- If confirmed I will install, initialize, and start the server, then connect locally and perform SQL operations as you direct (one SQL statement per Action).\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement (in the SQL markdown block format you required) for you to execute and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and supply the requested details. After that I will either run the necessary environment commands (only with your permission) or produce Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement (one-line SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw output. When all data are collected and verified I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer as required.",
