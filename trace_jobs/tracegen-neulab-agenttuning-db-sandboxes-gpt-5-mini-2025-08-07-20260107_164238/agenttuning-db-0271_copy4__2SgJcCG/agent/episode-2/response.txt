  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a minimal container (/app). No MySQL server or client is present: /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is running, mysql client is not installed, and no credentials (.my.cnf or env vars) were found. Nothing has been executed that interacts with a database yet.",
  "plan": "I need the database question and connection details (or permission to install a client and run a local server). Please tell me: 1) The exact question you want answered (what table(s), columns, filters, or the modification you want). 2) Connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name — or provide a SQL dump. Options: A) If you provide remote DB credentials, I will install a mysql client (if needed) and connect then issue a single SQL statement in the required single-line SQL code block for you to execute and return results. B) If you want me to prepare the environment here, give permission to install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) or to install a local MariaDB server; I will run the minimal commands to be able to connect and then issue the SQL. C) If you only want guidance or to run SQL locally yourself, provide the question and I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement to run. Tell me which option you choose.",
