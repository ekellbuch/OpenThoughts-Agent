  "analysis": "The container is ready: you are root in /app on Ubuntu 24.04 and the mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running and no database connection info or question has been provided. No SQL has been executed because I have no target database or task to operate on.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you choose how you want to proceed. Please pick one of the options below and provide the required details. After you provide the details I will follow your protocol (one SQL statement per interaction in a single SQL code block, or Final Answer when finished).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also tell me whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client or whether you will run the SQL yourself. If you want me to connect, I will run the mysql client and then produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL code block for execution.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install and initialize a local server, start it, and then proceed to run SQL statements (one at a time) per your protocol.\n\nOption C — You only want me to craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute on your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and supply the necessary details. After that I will either (1) run environment commands here (if you permit connecting/installing), or (2) output Action: Operation with one SQL statement (in the exact format you required) for you to execute and return results, or (3) output Action: Answer when finished.",
