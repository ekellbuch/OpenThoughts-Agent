  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no credentials/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I cannot perform any SQL operations until you (a) provide connection credentials for an existing server, (b) permit installation/initialization of a local server here, or (c) provide the schema/dump so I can craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these three options you want and provide the required details; I will then proceed exactly per your protocol (each operation: produce Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when finished: Action: Answer with Final Answer array).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also tell me whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client. If yes, I will use a one-shot invocation like: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\"; prior to execution I will output Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement (one-line SQL code block) as you required.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- If confirmed I will install and initialize a server and start it. Typical commands I would run (only with your explicit approval) include: apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server), initialize/start the service, then connect locally as root and run SQL. After the server is running I will produce Action: Operation statements (one SQL statement at a time) until completion.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute on your environment and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and include the required details (for Option A: connection info + question; for Option B: confirm and root password preference; for Option C: schema + question). After you reply I will either run environment commands (only if you permit) or output the first Action according to your required format.",
