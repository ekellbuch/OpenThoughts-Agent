  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and usable. There is no local MySQL server running (previous checks showed /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist and no mysqld/mariadbd process is running) and no credentials/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables were found. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I have repeatedly requested how you'd like to proceed but have not received a choice or credentials/schema from you yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the three options below and provide the required details. After you provide the details I will follow your protocol (each operation: output Action: Operation and include exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when finished: Action: Answer with Final Answer array).\n\nOptions (choose one):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Tell me whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client (I will run a one-shot mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\") or whether you only want the SQL crafted for you to run.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server installed and provide a root password or allow me to auto-generate one. Indicate preference for mariadb-server or mysql-server (I recommend mariadb-server if unsure).\n- If confirmed, I will install, initialize, start the server, secure the root user, and then connect locally to run queries one at a time per your rules.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to execute in your environment and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nOnce you reply with which option you choose and the necessary details, I will proceed with the exact next steps. If you choose Option A and let me connect from this container, I will (1) run the one-shot mysql client command here using the provided credentials and the SQL statement I present as Action: Operation, then (2) analyze the returned output and iterate until producing Action: Answer. If you choose Option B I will install/start the server and then follow the same one-statement-per-interaction flow. If you choose Option C I will craft the SQL statement immediately.",
