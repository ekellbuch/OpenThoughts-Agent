  "analysis": "The container now has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is still no MySQL server or any database connection configured in this environment: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysqld process was found earlier, and no credentials (.my.cnf or environment vars) were discovered. No SQL has been executed against any database yet because you have not provided a question or connection details. I cannot run SQL without either (A) credentials to connect to a remote MySQL server, (B) permission to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here, or (C) a database dump/schema to load locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server you control:\n- Provide host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name, plus the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (per your rules). You (or I, using the installed mysql client) will run it and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue until we can produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server and provide a root password (or allow me to generate one). I will install the server, initialize, start it, and then connect. After that I will produce SQL statements in single-statement steps as required.\n\nOption C — You only want SQL crafted for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute on your environment.\n\nWhen you respond, tell me which option to use and give the required details. If you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, specify whether I should use the mysql client here (I will then run it) or just provide the SQL for you to run remotely.",
