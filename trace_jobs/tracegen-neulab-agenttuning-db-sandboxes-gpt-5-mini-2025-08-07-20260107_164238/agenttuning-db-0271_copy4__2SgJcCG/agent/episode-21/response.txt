  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container as root at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I am waiting for you to choose how to proceed so I can follow your required interaction protocol (one SQL statement per operation in a single-line SQL code block, and Action: Answer when finished).",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the three options you want and provide the requested details. After you reply I will proceed exactly per your protocol (when performing operations I will output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when finished I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer array).\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host, port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also tell me whether I should connect from this container using the installed mysql client (I will run a one-shot mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\") or whether you only want me to craft the SQL for you to run remotely.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a root password (or permit me to auto-generate one).\n- If confirmed I will install and initialize a local server, start it, and then connect locally. After that I will issue SQL statements one at a time as required.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to execute in your environment and then paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nWhat I need from you now: choose Option A, B, or C and supply the required details. If Option A and you want me to connect from this container, include credentials and confirm I should use the installed mysql client. If Option B, confirm installation of a local server and supply/allow a root password. If Option C, provide the schema and the exact question. Once you reply I will proceed.",
