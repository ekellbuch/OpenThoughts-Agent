  "analysis": "You are root in a minimal container at /app. I ran several probes and found: no MySQL server files (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist), no mysqld/mariadbd process is running, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no MySQL-related environment variables are present, and no /root/.my.cnf exists. In short: there is currently no local MySQL server or client available in this environment and no credentials/configuration to connect to an external DB have been provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the database question and connection details so I can operate on your MySQL database. Specifically, please tell me: 1) The question you want answered (what table/columns/conditions or the task you want done). 2) Connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name (or provide a .sql dump). If the DB is local and you want me to install a client here, I can install a MySQL/MariaDB client and then connect; indicate if you want that. If you prefer I connect to a remote server, ensure network access and provide credentials. Once you provide the question and credentials (or give permission to install a client), I will: - If needed, install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client). - Connect to the database using the provided credentials. - For each interaction I will either: (a) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (as you required) to be executed next, or (b) when finished, produce the Action: Answer block with the Final Answer array. At this point I will not execute any SQL because there is no client and no credentials. Please supply the DB question and credentials or say to proceed with installing a client here.",
