  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and usable. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process was found earlier) and there are no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I cannot perform any database operations until you either provide connection credentials for an existing server, allow installation of a local server here, or provide the schema/dump and request SQL to be crafted.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of these three options and supply the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Indicate whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client (I will then run a one-shot mysql command) or whether you only want me to craft the SQL for you to run.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server installed and provide a root password or allow me to auto-generate one. Also indicate preference for mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- If confirmed I will install, initialize, and start the server, then connect and run SQL statements as you direct.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement (in a single SQL code block) for you to execute in your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you reply, specify the option (A, B, or C) and supply the necessary details. After that I will proceed and follow your required interaction pattern: when operating I will output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (no other comments) for you to execute and return the output; when finished I will output Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.",
