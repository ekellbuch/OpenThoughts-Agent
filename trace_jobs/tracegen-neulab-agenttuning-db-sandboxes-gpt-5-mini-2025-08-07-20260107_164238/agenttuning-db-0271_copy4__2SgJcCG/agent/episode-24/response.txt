  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and usable. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I cannot run SQL against any database until you either (A) provide connection credentials for an existing MySQL server, (B) permit installation and initialization of a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (and optionally provide a root password), or (C) provide the schema/dump and request the SQL to be crafted for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Tell me which option you want to use (A, B, or C) and provide the required details so I can proceed. Specifically:\n\n- Option A (connect to existing server): provide host, port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered. Also state whether you want me to connect from this container (I will use the installed mysql client) or only craft SQL for you to run.\n\n- Option B (install local server): confirm you want a local server installed and provide a root password or allow me to auto-generate one. I will then install and start the server and proceed to run queries locally.\n\n- Option C (craft SQL only): provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question; I will return the exact single-line SQL statement in the required SQL code block format for you to run.\n\nAfter you choose and supply the details I will follow your protocol: when operating I will produce Action: Operation and include exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (no other comments); you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until I produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.",
