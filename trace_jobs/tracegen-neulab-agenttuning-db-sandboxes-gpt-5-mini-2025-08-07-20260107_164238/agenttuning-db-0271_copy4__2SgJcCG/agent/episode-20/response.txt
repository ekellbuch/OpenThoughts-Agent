  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process was found earlier) and there are no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or DB-related environment variables. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I am waiting for you to tell me how to proceed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these three options and provide the requested information. After you reply I will follow your required interaction pattern (each operation: a single SQL statement in a one-line SQL code block, or when finished: Action: Answer with Final Answer array). Options and exactly what to provide:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host, port, username, password, database name, and the exact question (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregates, or modifications).\n- Also indicate whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client. If yes, I will run a one-shot command of this form (I'll show the SQL as Action: Operation before execution):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\"\n- After I produce Action: Operation (one-line SQL in a SQL code block), you will execute it (or allow me to execute it) and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- If confirmed I will install and initialize a server and start it. Typical commands I will run (if you approve) are:\n  apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n  # initialize/start service and secure installation steps\n  systemctl start mariadb || service mysql start\n  mysql -u root -p'ROOTPASSWORD' -e \"CREATE DATABASE ...;\"\n- After the server is running I will connect locally and then produce Action: Operation statements (one SQL statement per interaction) until finished.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to run on your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and include the required details (credentials and the exact question for Option A, confirmation + root password preference for Option B, or schema + question for Option C). Once you provide that I will proceed and output the next Action according to your protocol.",
