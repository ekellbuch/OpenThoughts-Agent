  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container as root at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no credential files or environment variables were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. At this point I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either (A) give connection credentials to an existing MySQL server, (B) permit me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (and provide or allow generation of a root password), or (C) provide schema/dump and the question so I can craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Tell me which option you want and provide the required information; I will then proceed accordingly.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- If you want me to connect from this container, confirm that and I will run the mysql client here and then output a single Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement (one-line SQL markdown block) for you to execute. You will run it and return the raw MySQL output, and we will iterate.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install the server package, initialize and start it, then connect and produce single-statement SQL operations (Action: Operation) as required until we reach a final Action: Answer.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute on your environment and return the output.\n\nOnce you pick an option and supply the details, I will: (1) perform any required environment actions (install/start server or connect), (2) produce exactly one SQL statement per interaction in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation), and (3) when finished produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and the necessary details.",
