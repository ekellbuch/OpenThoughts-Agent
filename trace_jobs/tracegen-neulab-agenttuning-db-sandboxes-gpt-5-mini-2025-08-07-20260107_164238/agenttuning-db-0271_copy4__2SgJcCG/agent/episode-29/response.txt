  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed and is available. There is no local MySQL server running (previous checks showed /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist and no mysqld/mariadbd process is running) and no credentials or .my.cnf were found. No SQL has been executed because you have not yet provided a database question or connection details. I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either provide connection credentials for an existing server, allow installation and initialization of a local server in the container, or provide the schema/dump and ask me to craft SQL to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these three options and supply the required details. After you choose, I will proceed exactly per your protocol (when operating I will output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when finished I will output Action: Answer with the Final Answer array).\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Also state whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client (one-shot mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\") or whether you only want me to craft the SQL for you to run remotely.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one) and indicate preference for mariadb-server or mysql-server (I recommend mariadb-server for smaller footprint).\n- If confirmed I will: 1) install the server package, 2) initialize/start the service, 3) secure/set root password, and 4) connect and run queries. I will show the exact SQL to run (one statement per interaction) and proceed after you run/confirm each step.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question. I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, include credentials and confirm I should use the installed mysql client. If you choose Option B, confirm installation and provide/allow a root password. If you choose Option C, provide the schema and the question. Once you reply with your choice and details I will produce the next Action per your rules.",
