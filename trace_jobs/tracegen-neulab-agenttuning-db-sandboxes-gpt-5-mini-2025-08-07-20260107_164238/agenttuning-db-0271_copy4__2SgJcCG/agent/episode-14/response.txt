  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container as root at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed and is available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process) and no database credentials or configuration files (.my.cnf) were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. At this point I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server, (B) permit installation and initialization of a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (and optionally provide a root password), or (C) provide the schema/dump and the question so I can craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the following options and provide the required information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Indicate whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client or if you will run the SQL yourself. If you want me to connect, I will run the mysql client here and then, per your protocol, produce Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block for you to execute; you will return the raw MySQL output and we will iterate.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then connect locally. After that I will issue SQL statements one at a time (Action: Operation) until finished, then produce Action: Answer.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute on your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you reply, specify which option you choose and supply the necessary details. After that I will proceed and follow your required interaction pattern (one SQL statement per operation in a single-line SQL code block, and Action: Answer when finished).",
