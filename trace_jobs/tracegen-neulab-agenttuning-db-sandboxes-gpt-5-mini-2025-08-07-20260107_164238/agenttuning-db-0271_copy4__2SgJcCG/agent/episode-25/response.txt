  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container as root at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed and works. There is no local MySQL server or data present (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql did not exist earlier), no mysqld/mariadbd process is running, and no credentials or .my.cnf were found. No SQL has been executed because no target database or query has been provided. I cannot connect to or operate on any database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide the required details; after you do I will follow your protocol (when performing DB operations I will output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block, and when finished I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer array).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host, port, username, password, and database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Tell me whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client (I will then run a one-shot command) or whether you only want the SQL crafted for you to run remotely.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm that you want me to install and initialize a local server and provide a root password or allow me to auto-generate one.\n- If you confirm, I will run the necessary apt commands to install and start the server, then connect locally and proceed with SQL operations (one statement per interaction).\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, I will execute queries in a one-shot form such as: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\". If you choose Option B, indicate whether to install mariadb-server or mysql-server and provide/allow a root password. After you reply with your choice and details, I will proceed and present the next Action according to your rules.",
