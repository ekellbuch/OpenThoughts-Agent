  "analysis": "I inspected the container, found no MySQL server or client initially, then installed the MySQL client. apt-get completed successfully and mysql --version reports mysql 8.0.44 is installed. No MySQL server or credentials are present in the environment, so no SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you provide the database connection details and the question you want answered. Please tell me: 1) The exact question (what table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications you want). 2) Connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name — or provide a SQL dump or .my.cnf file. Options if you prefer: A) Connect to a remote DB you provide credentials for; I will produce a single-line SQL statement (in the required markdown SQL block) for you to execute. B) Allow me to install and run a local MariaDB/MySQL server here (I can install and initialize one) — tell me if you want that. C) If you want me only to craft SQL for you to run elsewhere, give the schema and the question and I will produce the one-line SQL to run. Once you provide credentials and the question, I will either: - Output Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (one line) for you to run and return the raw MySQL output, or - If finished, output Action: Answer with Final Answer as required. I will follow the exact interaction rules you specified.",
