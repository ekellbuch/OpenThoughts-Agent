  "analysis": "Current environment is a minimal container running as root in /app. Previous checks showed no MySQL server or client installed, no MySQL files or processes, and no credentials available. To execute SQL against a MySQL server I need a client available here or remote connection details. Nothing has been done yet to install a client in this session.",
  "plan": "1) Identify the OS (cat /etc/os-release) to ensure we use the correct package manager. 2) If this is a Debian/Ubuntu-like container, install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so we can connect to a remote MySQL server. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed. After the client is installed, I'll ask you to provide the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the exact question you want answered. Once you provide connection details and the question, I will produce a single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute; you'll run it and return the output, and we'll iterate until done.",
