  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process was found earlier) and there are no credential/configuration files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or connection details. I am waiting for you to tell me how you want to proceed.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of three options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host, port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Indicate whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client or whether you only want me to craft the SQL for you to run.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- If confirmed I will install and initialize the server, start it, and then connect locally and run SQL statements one at a time as required.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement (in the SQL code block format you required) for you to execute and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nOnce you tell me which option and supply the necessary details, I will proceed. Per your protocol, for any operation I will output Action: Operation and provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when finished I will output Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.",
