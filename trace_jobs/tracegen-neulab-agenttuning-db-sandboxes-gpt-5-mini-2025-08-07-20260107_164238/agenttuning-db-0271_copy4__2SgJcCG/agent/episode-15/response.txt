  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed and is available. There is no local MySQL server running and there are no credentials or configuration files present (no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql, no /root/.my.cnf, and no mysqld process found earlier). No SQL has been executed because you haven't provided a database question or connection details. Nothing further has been done since the client installation.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details; I will then follow your required interaction pattern (one SQL statement per operation in a single-line SQL code block, or Action: Answer when done).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modification you want performed).\n- Also indicate whether you want me to connect from this container using the installed mysql client or whether you will run the SQL yourself. If you want me to connect from here I will run mysql with the supplied credentials and then (per your rules) output one Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one).\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize a local server, start it, and then connect locally. After that I will issue SQL statements one at a time (Action: Operation) and iterate until I can give the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) and the question. I will craft the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL markdown block) for you to execute on your environment and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to connect from this container, indicate whether I should run the mysql client interactively or whether you prefer a one-shot query using: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\" . If you choose Option B, confirm and give the root password or permission to generate one. After you reply with your choice and the required details I will proceed.",
