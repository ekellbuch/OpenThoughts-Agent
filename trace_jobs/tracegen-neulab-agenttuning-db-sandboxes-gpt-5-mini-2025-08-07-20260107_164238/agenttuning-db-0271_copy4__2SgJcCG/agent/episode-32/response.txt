  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running and no database files or credentials were detected earlier (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process, no /root/.my.cnf, no MySQL env vars). No SQL has been executed because no target database, schema, or connection credentials and no question have been provided. I cannot perform any database operations until you provide connection details, a schema/dump, or permission to install/start a local server.",
  "plan": "Please choose exactly one of the three options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed. After you choose I will follow your protocol (when operating I will output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when finished I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer array).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB).\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (tables/columns/filters/aggregations or modifications).\n- Indicate whether I should run the query from this container using the installed mysql client (I will then run a one-shot mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\") or just craft the SQL for you to run.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container.\n- Confirm you want this and provide a root password or allow me to auto-generate one. Also state preference for mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- If confirmed I will install, initialize, start and secure the server, then connect locally and run SQL statements one at a time per your rules.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will return the exact single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to connect, include credentials and confirm I should use the installed mysql client; if Option B, confirm installation and provide/allow a root password; if Option C, provide schema and question. Once you reply with the option and details I will proceed.",
