  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and usable. There is no local MySQL server or data present (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist), no mysqld/mariadbd process is running, and no credential files (.my.cnf) or MySQL-related environment variables were found. No SQL has been executed because no target database, schema, or connection credentials were provided. I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed and provide the required details. Pick exactly one option and supply the requested information so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port, username, password, database name, and the exact question/query you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, or modifications).\n- Tell me whether you want me to run the query from this container using the installed mysql client (I will run a one-shot mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE -e \"SQL\") or whether you only want me to craft the SQL for you to run remotely.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or allow me to auto-generate one). Also indicate preference for mariadb-server or mysql-server.\n- If confirmed I will install, initialize, start and secure the server, then connect locally and run queries as you request.\n\nOption C — I only craft SQL for you to run elsewhere:\n- Provide the schema (table names and column names) or a brief description of the tables involved and the exact question.\n- I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement (in a single SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nWhen you reply, include the chosen option and the necessary details. Once I have that I will either: (1) install/start a local server if you requested Option B, or (2) connect and run queries from this container (Option A) or (3) immediately craft the single-line SQL for you (Option C). Per your protocol, each operation I request you to execute will be exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block; when done I will produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array.",
