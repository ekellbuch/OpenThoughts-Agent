  "analysis": "The container currently has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, no .sql dump files were found, and nothing is listening on port 3306. I cannot run any SQL yet because you have not provided a SQL question, a database schema, a local .sql dump path, or remote connection credentials. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What still needs to be done: you must choose how you want to proceed and provide the necessary details (remote DB credentials and the SQL question, upload a .sql dump path, or confirm installation of a local server and provide any desired passwords/usernames/databases).",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following options you want and provide the required details; I will then proceed as described below and follow your protocol (explain the SQL, then present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block when performing an Operation).\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question you want answered. If you want me to execute here, say whether I may embed the password on the command line or you will enter it interactively.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump — upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path. Also state whether you want me to install a local server and import it, or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container — confirm you want this and give any desired root password and any DB/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here) — provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nAfter you choose an option and provide the necessary details, I will either (A) explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one SQL statement in one SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) run the mysql client here (if you give remote credentials and permit execution).",
