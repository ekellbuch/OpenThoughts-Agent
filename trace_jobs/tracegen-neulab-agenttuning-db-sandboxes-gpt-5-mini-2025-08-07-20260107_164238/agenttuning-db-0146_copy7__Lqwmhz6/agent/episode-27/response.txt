  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql are absent, no mysqld process is present, nothing is listening on port 3306, and no .sql dump files were found. No SQL question, schema, local dump path, or remote DB credentials have been provided, so no SQL can be executed. What has been done: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and provide the necessary details (remote DB credentials + SQL question, path to a .sql dump, or confirmation to install a local server and desired passwords/users/databases).",
  "plan": "Wait for you to pick one of these options and provide required details, then proceed accordingly:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server: provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question. If you want me to run it here noninteractively, explicitly allow embedding the password; I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer interactive entry, I will omit the password flag and prompt.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump: upload or place the .sql file into the container and tell me its full path. Tell me whether you want me to install a local server and import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here: confirm and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create DB/user, and run your SQL.\n\nOption 4 — Only craft SQL (no execution here): provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nAfter you provide your choice and the required details I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either (A) present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) execute the SQL here if you provided credentials and permitted execution.",
