  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client or server installed or running. mysql is not found, there is no mysqld process, the typical MySQL directories (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) do not exist, and nothing is listening on port 3306. To run SQL here I must either install a MySQL client and connect to a remote server (credentials required) or be given a database dump or schema to operate on. No SQL question or connection details have been provided yet.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client so I can connect to a remote MySQL/MariaDB server if you provide connection details, or run SQL against any local .sql dump if one exists. Steps:\n1) Update apt package lists (apt-get update).\n2) Install the default MySQL client package (apt-get install -y default-mysql-client).\n3) Verify the mysql client is available (mysql --version).\n4) Search the filesystem for any .sql dump files to see if a local dump exists (find / -type f -name '*.sql').\nAfter these steps I'll ask you to provide the SQL question and either the connection credentials or indicate which local dump to use. If you provide credentials, I'll prepare a single SQL statement (in the required markdown SQL block) and you can execute it; I'll then parse the returned MySQL output and continue.",
