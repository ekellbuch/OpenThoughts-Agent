  "analysis": "The container has mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL config/data directories (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) and no .sql dump files found. Because you have not provided a SQL question, a schema, a local dump, or remote database connection credentials, I cannot execute any SQL yet. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server using the installed client, or to install and initialize a local server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these you want and provide the required details; I will then proceed and (per your protocol) either produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute or run the SQL from this container if you allow me to provide credentials here.\n\nOptions (choose one):\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question.\n   - If you want me to execute here, say whether I may include the password on the command line (less secure) or you will enter it interactively when prompted. If permitted, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n   - If you prefer to run SQL yourself, I will craft a single-line SQL statement (in one SQL code block) for you to run elsewhere.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump\n   - Place or upload the .sql file inside the container and tell me its full path. I can either (A) install a local server and import it, or (B) craft SQL for you to run against the dump elsewhere.\n   - If you want import here, confirm and provide any desired root password; I'll install a server (mariadb-server or mysql-server), start it, then import: mysql -u root -p < /path/to/dump.sql\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here\n   - Confirm and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create. I will run apt-get install to install the server, start and secure it, create the required database/user, and then run the SQL you ask.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here)\n   - Provide the schema (table names, columns and types) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will parse and continue.\n\nSecurity notes:\n- Prefer interactive password entry to avoid embedding credentials in command lines. If you explicitly permit, I can include passwords non-interactively for convenience.\n\nOnce you choose an option and provide the needed details (or the schema/question), I will either:\n- Explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or\n- Execute the command here (if you provided credentials and allowed me to run them) and process the returned MySQL output.\n\nPlease reply with the option you want and the necessary details.",
