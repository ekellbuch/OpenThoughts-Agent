  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL data directories present, and there are no .sql dumps found on the filesystem. At this point I cannot run any SQL because you have not provided a SQL question, a schema, a local dump, or remote database connection credentials. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server using the mysql client, or to have a local server installed if you request it.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice among these options and then proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — You provide a SQL question and remote connection details:\n- Provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you prefer interactive prompt), and database name, plus the SQL question.\n- I will explain the SQL I intend to run, then (per your protocol) produce a single SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute. If you want me to run it from this container, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\" (I will ask for confirmation before including a password on the command line).\n\nOption B — You provide a local .sql dump or schema & question:\n- Upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me its path, or provide the schema (table names, columns) and your question.\n- I can either install a local server and import the dump, or craft the SQL for you to run elsewhere. If you want a local server installed, confirm and provide desired root password and database/user names.\n\nOption C — You want me to install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here:\n- Confirm and provide any desired root password and DB/user names.\n- I will run apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server), start the service, secure/init the instance, create user/database, and then run the SQL you ask.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details. If you only want me to write a single SQL statement (to run elsewhere), provide the schema and question and I will return exactly one SQL statement in the required SQL code block (no extra text in that block).",
