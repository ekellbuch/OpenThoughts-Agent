  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client successfully (mysql 8.0.44) in the container. There are still no local MySQL server processes, no MySQL data/config directories, and there were no .sql dump files found on the filesystem. In short: the client is available, but there is no database to query locally right now. To run SQL we need either (A) connection details to a remote MySQL server, (B) a .sql dump or schema to load, or (C) permission to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide necessary details. Specifically:\n\n- If you provide remote connection info (host, port, username, password, database), I will run the mysql client from this container to connect and execute SQL. The exact command I will use is: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\n- If you give me a SQL question and the schema (table names and columns) but do not want me to connect, I'll craft a single-line SQL statement for you to run elsewhere. Per your protocol, I will present that SQL in a single SQL code block (one statement per round), and you will run it and return the raw MySQL output.\n\n- If you want me to create a local MySQL server here, tell me to proceed; I will install a server package (or mariadb-server), initialize it, and create a user/database as requested.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide credentials or the schema/question. If you want me to connect to a remote server, include the exact host, port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), and database name. After you provide that, I will (A) explain the SQL I will run, and (B) output exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block when you ask me to operate.",
