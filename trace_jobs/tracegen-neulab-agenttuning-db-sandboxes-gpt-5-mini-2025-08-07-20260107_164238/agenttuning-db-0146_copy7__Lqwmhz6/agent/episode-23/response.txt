  "analysis": "You are in a container that now has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql are absent, no mysqld process is present, no .sql dumps were found, and nothing is listening on port 3306. I have repeatedly requested you choose how to proceed but you haven't provided a decision, SQL question, schema, a .sql dump path, or remote DB credentials. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose one of the following actions and provide required details so I can proceed to run or craft SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of these options and provide the required details: \n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you will enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question. If you want me to run it from this container and permit noninteractive use, explicitly allow embedding the password; otherwise I will prompt interactively. I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\" for noninteractive runs.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump — upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path. Also state whether you want me to install a local server and import it (I will install mariadb-server or mysql-server) or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here — confirm and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here) — provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nWhen you reply with your choice and the necessary details, I will (a) explain the SQL I intend to run, and then (b) either present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (c) run the command here if you provided credentials and allowed execution. If you want me to scan for network MySQL servers first, say so and I will run a brief port scan.",
