  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, and no .sql dump files were found on the filesystem. I cannot run any SQL yet because you haven't provided a SQL question, schema, a local dump path, or remote DB connection credentials. What has been done: environment probing and mysql client installation. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and provide the necessary details.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of these options and provide the required details, then I will proceed as described:\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server (recommended if DB exists remotely):\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question.\n   - If you want me to run it here and permit embedding the password, I'll run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\".\n   - If you prefer interactive password entry, I'll omit the password and prompt you.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump:\n   - Upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path.\n   - Tell me whether you want me to (A) install a local server and import it, or (B) just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n   - Confirm and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create.\n   - I'll install a server (e.g., mariadb-server), start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n   - Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nAfter you choose an option and provide details, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either (A) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) execute the SQL here (if you provided credentials and permitted execution).",
