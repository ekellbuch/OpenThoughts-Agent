  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, and no .sql dump files were found on the filesystem. Nothing is listening on port 3306. You have not provided a SQL question, schema, a .sql dump path, or remote database credentials, so I cannot run any SQL queries yet. Environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server or to install and initialize a local server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of these options so I can proceed. After you choose I will follow the indicated exact steps and either produce a single SQL statement (in the required SQL code block) for you to execute or run the mysql client here if you provide credentials and permit execution.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server (recommended if DB exists remotely)\n   - You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question.\n   - If you want me to run the SQL here and permit embedding the password, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer interactive password entry, I will omit the password flag and prompt.\n   - If you prefer to run the SQL yourself, provide the schema and question and I will craft exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to run.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump\n   - Upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me the full path.\n   - Tell me whether you want me to (A) install a local server and import it, or (B) just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n   - If you allow a local server install, I will install mariadb-server (or mysql-server), start it, and import the dump: mysql -u root -p < /path/to/dump.sql, then run the SQL you request.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container\n   - Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create.\n   - I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server), start the service, secure/init it, create requested DB/user, and then run the SQL you ask.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here)\n   - Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output here, I will parse and continue.\n\nSecurity note: embedding passwords on the command line is less secure; prefer interactive password entry unless you explicitly permit embedding. Reply with the option number and the required details (credentials, dump path, schema, or confirmation to install a local server).",
