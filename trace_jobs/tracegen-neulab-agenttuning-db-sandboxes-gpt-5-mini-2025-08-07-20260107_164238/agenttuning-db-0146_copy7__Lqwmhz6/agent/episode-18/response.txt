  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, and no .sql dump files were found. Nothing is listening on port 3306. I cannot run any SQL queries yet because you have not provided a SQL question, a schema, a local .sql dump path, or remote database connection credentials. Environment readiness: mysql client is available and I can (a) connect to a remote MySQL server if you supply credentials, (b) install and initialize a local server if you permit, or (c) craft SQL for you to run elsewhere if you provide the schema and question.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the four options and provide the required details. After you choose, I will proceed as follows:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server: you provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question. I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either (A) run it here using the mysql client (if you permit embedding the password or will enter it interactively), or (B) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump: you upload or place the .sql file inside the container and give me its full path. Tell me whether I should install a local server and import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere. If you permit a local server install, I will install and import and then run the requested SQL.\n\nOption 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here: confirm and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\nOption 4 — Only want SQL written (no execution here): provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nSecurity note: embedding passwords on the command line is less secure; prefer interactive password entry unless you explicitly permit embedding.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option and the necessary details (e.g., remote credentials + question, path to a .sql dump, confirmation to install local server with desired passwords, or schema + question). Once you do, I will follow your protocol (explain the SQL, then provide a single SQL statement in the required format or execute it here if credentials are provided and permitted).",
