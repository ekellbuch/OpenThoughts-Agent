  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, there is no mysqld process, nothing is listening on port 3306, and no .sql dumps were found on the filesystem. I cannot run any SQL because you have not provided a SQL question, a database schema, a local .sql dump path, or remote database connection credentials. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and provide the necessary details so I can execute or craft SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of four actions. Provide the required details for the chosen option and I'll proceed accordingly:\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate that you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question you want answered. Also state if I may embed the password on the command line for noninteractive execution.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump — upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path. Also say whether you want me to install a local server and import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container — confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any database/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here) — provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nAfter you provide your choice and the required details I will: (a) explain the SQL I will run, and then (b) either present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute (per your protocol), or (c) run the mysql client here if you supply credentials and permit execution.",
