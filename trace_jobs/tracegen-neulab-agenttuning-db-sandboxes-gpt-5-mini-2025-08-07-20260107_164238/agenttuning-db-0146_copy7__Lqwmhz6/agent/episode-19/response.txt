  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is running, and nothing is listening on port 3306. A filesystem search found no .sql dumps. You have not provided a SQL question, schema, a .sql dump path, or remote DB connection credentials, so I cannot run any SQL yet. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What still needs to be done: you must choose how to proceed and provide the necessary details (remote DB credentials + question, upload a .sql dump path, or permission to install a local server and provide desired root password/user/database).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of these options and provide the required details. When you choose, I will proceed as described:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server (recommended if DB is remote):\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question (what you want returned).\n- If you want me to execute here and permit embedding the password, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer interactive password entry, I'll omit the password and prompt.\n- If you prefer to run SQL yourself, provide the schema and question and I will craft a single-line SQL statement for you (in the required SQL code block format).\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump:\n- Upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path.\n- Decide whether I should install a local server and import it here (I will prompt for root password if needed) or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here:\n- Confirm and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create.\n- I will install (apt-get install mariadb-server or mysql-server), start the service, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\nOption 4 — Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue.\n\nSecurity note: embedding passwords on the command line is less secure; prefer interactive password entry unless you explicitly permit embedding. After you choose an option and provide details, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either (A) present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) run the mysql client here if you provided credentials and allowed execution.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option and supply the necessary details so I can proceed.",
