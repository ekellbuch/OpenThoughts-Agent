  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL config/data directories (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) and no .sql dump files were found on the filesystem. No SQL question, schema, local dump path, or remote DB connection credentials have been provided, so no SQL has been executed. The environment is ready to: (A) connect to a remote MySQL server using the installed client, (B) import/query a provided .sql dump after you place it here, or (C) install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "You must choose one option so I can proceed. Provide the required details for the chosen option below and I will follow your protocol (explain the SQL I will run, then present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block when performing an Operation). Options:\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you will enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question (what you want returned).\n   - If you want me to run the SQL from this container, say whether I may include the password on the command line or you will supply it interactively.\n   - If you prefer to run it yourself elsewhere, provide the schema and question and I will craft the single-line SQL for you.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump\n   - Upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path.\n   - Tell me whether I should (A) install a local server here and import it, or (B) just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container\n   - Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any database/user names to create.\n   - I will install a server package (mariadb-server or mysql-server), start it, create the requested DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here)\n   - Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nIf you pick option 1 and give remote credentials, I will run (with permission to embed password):\nmysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nIf you pick option 3 (install local server), I will run (example):\napt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server && systemctl start mariadb\nand then create DB/user via mysql client and import any dump if provided.\n\nReply with your chosen option and the required details. After that, I will either (A) produce one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute, or (B) execute the SQL here (if you provided credentials and allowed me to use them).",
