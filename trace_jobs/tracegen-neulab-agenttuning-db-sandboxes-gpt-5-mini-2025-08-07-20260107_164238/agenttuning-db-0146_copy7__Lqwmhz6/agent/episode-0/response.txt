  "analysis": "Current shell is a root bash in the container (/app). No MySQL commands have been run yet and no question about the database has been provided by you. I can't see any evidence yet whether a MySQL server or client exists or where the database files/sockets are. To proceed I need to know the specific question you want answered about the MySQL database (for example: list tables in a database, select rows with certain conditions, aggregate queries, modify data, etc.). Before you provide that question, I'll probe the environment to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server or client is present and where its files/sockets/listening port are so we know how to connect and run SQL.",
  "plan": "1) Check if a MySQL/MariaDB client binary is installed (mysql --version). 2) Check running processes for mysqld to see if a server is running. 3) List common config/data paths (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql) to find databases and sockets. 4) Check if a process is listening on port 3306 (common MySQL port). After these probes I'll report results and ask you for the specific SQL question you want answered. If you already have a specific question, provide it and I'll prepare one single SQL statement as requested. Commands below will only inspect the environment.",
