  "analysis": "Current environment summary: the container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, the typical MySQL config/data directories (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) do not exist, and a filesystem search returned no .sql dump files. I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either provide connection details to a remote server, upload a .sql dump or schema, or permit installation of a local server. You have not yet provided a SQL question or chosen how you want me to proceed. What has been accomplished: mysql client installation and environment probing. What still needs to be done: you must choose one of the available options and supply necessary details so I can execute SQL or craft a correct SQL statement for you.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following options. For each option I list exactly what I will run (if you permit) and what I will expect from you.\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server (preferred if DB already exists remotely):\n- What I need from you: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question you want answered (e.g., list tables, select rows matching X, an aggregate, etc.).\n- If you want me to execute here and you permit embedding the password, I'll run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer interactive password entry, I will omit the password flag and prompt.\n- If you prefer to run the SQL yourself, provide the schema (tables/columns) and question and I will craft a single-line SQL statement for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump:\n- What I need from you: upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me the full path.\n- If you want me to import and query it here, confirm whether I may install a local server. If yes, I'll install mariadb-server (or mysql-server), start it, and import the dump: mysql -u root -p < /path/to/dump.sql (root password entry may be required). After import I will run the SQL you request.\n- If you prefer not to install a server, I can still inspect the dump file (grep/less) and craft SQL statements for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here:\n- What I need from you: confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any database/user names to create.\n- Commands I will run (example): apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server, then start the service and run mysql commands to create databases/users and run your requested SQL. Expect service startup and potential interactive secure-install steps unless handled non-interactively.\n\nOption 4 — Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n- What I need from you: the schema (table names, columns and types) and the question. I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue.\n\nNotes on protocol and security:\n- Per your rules, when I operate I will present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block; you will execute only the first SQL block and return raw MySQL output. I will then process that output and continue.\n- For noninteractive remote connections, embedding passwords on the command line is less secure; prefer interactive password entry. If you explicitly permit embedding, I will use the -p'<password>' form for noninteractive runs.\n\nNext step: reply with which option you choose and supply the required details. If you choose Option 1 and want me to run the query here, include host, port (if not 3306), user, database, the password (or say you'll enter it interactively), and the specific question. If you choose Option 2, upload the .sql file or tell me its path. If you choose Option 3, confirm and provide desired passwords/user/db names. If you choose Option 4, provide the schema and the question and I will return a single-line SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute.",
