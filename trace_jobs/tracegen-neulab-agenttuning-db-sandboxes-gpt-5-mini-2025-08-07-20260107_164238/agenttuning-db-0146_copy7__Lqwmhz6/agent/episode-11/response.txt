  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL config/data directories, and no .sql dump files were found. Because you have not yet provided a SQL question, a schema, a local dump path, or remote DB connection credentials, I cannot run any SQL queries. The environment is ready to either: (A) connect to a remote MySQL server using the installed client, (B) import/query a provided .sql dump (after you place it in the container), or (C) install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details. Once you choose, I will either (1) craft exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block) for you to execute, or (2) run the mysql client here (if you give connection details and permission). Please pick one option and provide the details as specified below:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you will enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question (describe what you want: e.g., list tables, select rows matching X, aggregation, etc.).\n- If you want me to run the query from this container, indicate whether I may include the password on the command line (less secure) or you will supply it interactively.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump:\n- Upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me the full path.\n- Tell me whether you want me to (A) install a local server and import the dump here, or (B) just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in the container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create.\n- I will install the server, start it, create the user/database, and then run the SQL you request.\n\nOption 4 — Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output here, I will parse it and continue.\n\nNotes about how I'll present SQL per your protocol:\n- When operating, I will first explain the intent, then present one SQL statement only, in a single SQL markdown code block (one line). You will execute only the first SQL block and return raw MySQL output. If you choose Option 1 and want me to run the SQL here, I will use the mysql client like: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\" if you permit embedding the password.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option and the required details. Once you do, I will proceed and produce the single SQL statement or run the command here as you permit.",
