  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server, no MySQL data directories, and no .sql dumps found. No SQL question, schema, or remote database connection details have been provided, so no SQL has been executed. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server or to install a local server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the necessary details:\n\n1) Run SQL against a remote MySQL server you control: provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question. I will then either (A) run the SQL from this container (if you give permission to include password on the command line) or (B) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\n2) Run SQL against a local dump: upload or tell me the path to a .sql file in the container. I can import it into a local server (if you permit installing one) or craft statements to run against it.\n\n3) Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: confirm and provide any desired root password and DB/user names; I will install and initialize a server and then run the SQL you request.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now to install a local server, or to attempt a connection to a remote host, tell me which and provide the credentials or passwords. If you only want the SQL statement written (for you to run elsewhere), provide the schema (tables and columns) and the question and I will produce one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block as required.",
