  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, nothing is listening on port 3306, and no .sql dump files were found. You have not supplied a SQL question, schema, a path to a .sql dump, or remote database connection credentials. Therefore no SQL can be executed yet. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and provide the required details (remote DB credentials and the SQL question; or upload/place a .sql dump and indicate import preference; or confirm installation of a local server and provide desired root password/user/database; or provide the schema and question if you only want an SQL statement crafted).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of these options and provide the required details. Once you provide the details I will proceed as follows:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server:\n- You must provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or state you will enter it interactively), database name, and the exact SQL question (what you want returned).\n- If you want me to execute here and permit embedding the password, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". If you prefer interactive password entry, I will omit the password flag and prompt for it.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump:\n- Upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path.\n- Tell me whether to (A) install a local server and import it here (I will need confirmation to install and any root password you want), or (B) just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create.\n- I will install the server package, start it, create DB/user, and then run the SQL you request.\n\nOption 4 — Only craft SQL (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output here, I will parse it and continue.\n\nOnce you choose an option and provide the necessary details, I will either (A) explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute, or (B) run the mysql client here (if you supplied credentials and permitted execution) and then process the returned MySQL output.\n\nPlease reply with the option number and the required details so I can proceed.",
