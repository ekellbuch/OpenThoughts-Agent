  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, and a search found no .sql dump files. Nothing is listening on port 3306. No SQL question, schema, .sql dump path, or remote DB credentials have been provided, so I cannot run any SQL queries yet. What has been done: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and provide required details (remote DB credentials + question; or upload a .sql dump path; or confirm installation of a local server and provide desired root password/user/database; or provide schema + question if you only want SQL crafted).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the necessary details. Option 1 — Query a remote MySQL server: give host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question. Indicate whether I may embed the password on the command line for noninteractive execution. Option 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump: upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path; indicate whether to install a local server and import it. Option 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here: confirm and provide desired root password and any DB/user names to create. Option 4 — Only craft SQL (no execution here): provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere. After you pick an option and give details, I will explain the SQL I will run and then either (A) present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) run the mysql client here if you provided credentials and allowed execution.",
