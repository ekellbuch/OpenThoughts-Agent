There is no local MySQL server or database files present (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist), no .sql dumps were found, and nothing is listening on port 3306. I cannot run any SQL because you have not provided a SQL question, table schema, a .sql dump, or remote database connection credentials. I have repeatedly prompted for your choice of action but you haven't supplied the needed details. Environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server (client installed) or to install a local server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "To proceed I need you to pick one action. The simplest path (no software changes) is Option 4: you provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question you want answered and I will craft exactly one single-line SQL statement for you to execute elsewhere. If you prefer Option 1/2/3 instead, provide the required details (remote DB credentials + question; or path to an uploaded .sql dump; or confirmation to install a local server and desired root password/database/user). \n\nIf you pick Option 4 now, supply the schema (table names and columns) and the precise question (what rows/aggregates/filters you need). I will then: (a) explain briefly what the SQL will do, and (b) provide exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (one line) labeled as Action: Operation per your protocol. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse and continue.\n\nIf you want me to act here (connect or install), tell me which option and give credentials/confirm installation and I will run the necessary commands (I will explain beforehand).",
