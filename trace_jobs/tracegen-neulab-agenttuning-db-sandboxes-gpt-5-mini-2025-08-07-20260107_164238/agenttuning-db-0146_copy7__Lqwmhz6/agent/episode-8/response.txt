  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL data/config directories, and no .sql dumps found on the filesystem. You have not yet provided a SQL question, schema, local dump path, or remote database connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL queries yet. The environment is ready to either connect to a remote MySQL server using the installed client, to import/query a provided .sql dump (after you upload or place it here), or to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server if you ask me to do so.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do and provide the required details; I will then either (A) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute (per your protocol), or (B) run commands here to connect/import and then run the SQL if you permit credentials on the command line or allow interactive password entry.\n\nOptions:\n1) Query a remote MySQL server (most common):\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you prefer interactive prompt), database name, and the SQL question.\n   - If you want me to execute here, confirm whether I may include the password on the command line or will enter it interactively when prompted. I will then either run the mysql client here or present a single SQL statement (if you prefer to run it yourself remotely).\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump:\n   - Upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me its path. I can either import it into a local server (if you allow me to install one) or craft queries for you to run against it elsewhere. If you want a local server installed, confirm and provide any desired root password and DB/user names.\n\n3) Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n   - Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and database/user names to create. I will install (e.g., mariadb-server or mysql-server), start the service, secure/init the instance, create user/database, and then run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n   - Provide the schema (table names, columns and types) and the question. I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse and continue.\n\nSecurity notes:\n- Prefer interactive password entry rather than embedding passwords on the command line. If you explicitly permit, I can include passwords on the mysql command-line invocation for noninteractive runs.\n\nNext step: please choose one option and provide the required details (remote credentials and question, path to local dump, or permission to install a local server and any passwords/names). Once you do, I will proceed and follow your protocol (explain the SQL, then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block to be executed).",
