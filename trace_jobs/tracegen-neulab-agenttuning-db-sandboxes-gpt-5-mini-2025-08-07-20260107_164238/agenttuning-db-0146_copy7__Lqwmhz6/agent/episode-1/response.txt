  "analysis": "I probed the container for MySQL. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). There is no running MySQL/MariaDB server process (ps returned nothing). Standard MySQL configuration and data directories (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql) do not exist. Nothing is listening on port 3306. In short: there is currently no MySQL client or server available in this environment, so I cannot execute SQL here until I get access to a MySQL server or a SQL dump or install a client and connect to a remote server.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide one of the following so I can execute SQL and answer your question:\n\n1) If the database is on this host/container: provide connection details (how to connect locally) or a socket path, or supply a SQL dump file (.sql) or database files. Then I can either run SQL against it or load the dump.\n\n2) If the database is remote: provide hostname/IP, port (usually 3306), username, password (or a user with sufficient privileges), and database name. I will then install a MySQL client here (if needed) and run the SQL you request.\n\n3) If you only want help writing an SQL statement (and you will execute it elsewhere), tell me the schema (table names, columns and types) and the question. I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run.\n\nI can attempt to install a MySQL client here and/or look for any .sql files in the current filesystem if you want me to try to discover a local dump automatically. If you want me to try installing a client now, confirm and I'll run apt-get update and install a client (or the package manager available). If you instead want to provide the SQL question and schema now, I will craft a single-line SQL statement (in the required markdown code block) for you to execute and will wait for the output.\n\nNext steps I will take once you choose an option:\n- If you give me connection credentials or a dump, I'll run commands to connect/load and then run the SQL you ask.\n- If you want me to attempt installing a client, I'll run apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client) and then try to connect.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required details. I will then either (A) produce a single SQL statement in one SQL code block (if you want me to operate), or (B) produce the final answer if no execution is required.",
