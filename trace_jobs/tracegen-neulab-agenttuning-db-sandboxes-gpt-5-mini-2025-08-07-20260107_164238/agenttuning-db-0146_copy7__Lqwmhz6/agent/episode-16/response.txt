  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, and no .sql dump files were found on the filesystem. No SQL question, schema, remote connection credentials, or dump path has been provided by you yet, so I cannot execute any database queries. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and supply the necessary details (remote DB credentials and question, upload a .sql dump, or confirm installation of a local server and provide desired passwords/names).",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Please choose one of the following options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server (recommended if the DB already exists remotely):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question you want answered.\n  - If you want me to execute here and permit embedding the password, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". Otherwise I will prompt for the password interactively.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump:\n  - Upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me the full path.\n  - Tell me whether you want me to install a local server and import it, or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any database/user names to create.\n  - I will install the server package, start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\nOption 4 — Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nWhen you choose, I will either (A) explain the SQL I will run and present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) run the mysql client here if you provide credentials and permit execution. If you allow embedding passwords, please confirm that explicitly; otherwise I will prompt interactively for passwords.\n\nIf you want me to detect any reachable MySQL servers on the network before providing credentials, say so and I will run a brief network scan to discover hosts with port 3306 open (requires network access permission).",
