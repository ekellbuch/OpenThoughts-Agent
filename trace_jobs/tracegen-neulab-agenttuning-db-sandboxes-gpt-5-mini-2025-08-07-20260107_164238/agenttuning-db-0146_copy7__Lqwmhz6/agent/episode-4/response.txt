  "analysis": "The container now has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no standard MySQL directories (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) created, and no .sql dump files were found. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server using the mysql client, or to install and initialize a local server if you request. No SQL question or database connection details have been provided yet, so no SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide any required details:\n\n1) Run SQL against a remote MySQL server you control: provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), and database name. Once provided, I will (a) explain the SQL I will run, and (b) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single SQL code block for you to execute. If you want me to execute the SQL directly from this container, also confirm I should include the password on the command line; otherwise I will prompt interactively.\n\n2) Run SQL against a local dump: upload or place a .sql file in the container (or tell me its path). I can import it into a temporary local server (if you permit me to install one) or parse the file and run queries against it after loading.\n\n3) Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in the container: confirm and I will install a server package (e.g., mariadb-server or mysql-server), initialize it, start it, and create any users/databases you specify. Then I will run the SQL you request.\n\n4) If you only want SQL help (no execution here), provide the schema (table names, columns and types) and the question; I will produce a single-line SQL statement (in the required markdown code block) for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now with connecting to a remote server, please supply connection details and the exact SQL question. If you want a local server installed, say so and provide any desired root password and database/user names.\n\nBelow are the exact commands I will run once you pick an option:\n- To connect to a remote DB and run a one-off SQL: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n- To install a local server (if chosen): apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server), then systemctl start mariadb (or mysqld) and mysql -u root -e \"CREATE DATABASE ...;\"\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details. I will then either (A) produce one SQL statement in the required SQL code block for you to execute, or (B) run the appropriate commands here to connect/import and then run the SQL.",
