  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is running, and nothing is listening on port 3306. A filesystem search found no .sql dump files. Because you have not provided a SQL question, schema, a local dump path, or remote DB connection credentials, I cannot run any SQL queries yet. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What remains: you must choose how to proceed (connect to a remote DB, upload a .sql dump, or allow me to install a local server) and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, dump path, or confirmation and passwords).",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one option and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query a remote MySQL server (recommended if DB already exists remotely):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question you want answered.\n- If you want me to run the query here and permit embedding the password, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n- If you prefer interactive password entry, I will omit the password on the command line and you will type it when prompted.\n\nOption 2 — Operate on a local .sql dump:\n- Upload or place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path.\n- Tell me whether you want me to install a local server and import it, or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\nOption 3 — Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm and provide any desired root password and database/user names to create.\n- I will install the server (apt-get install), start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\nOption 4 — Only want SQL written (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nWhen you choose an option, I will: (a) explain the SQL I plan to run, then (b) present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (c) run the mysql client here if you provided credentials and allowed execution. Please state your chosen option and provide the required details.",
