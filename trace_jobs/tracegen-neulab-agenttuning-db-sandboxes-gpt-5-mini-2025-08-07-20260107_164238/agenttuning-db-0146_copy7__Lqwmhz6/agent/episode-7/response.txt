  "analysis": "The container has a MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL data/config directories, and no .sql dump files found on the filesystem. Because no SQL question, schema, remote connection details, or database dump have been provided, no SQL can be executed yet. The environment is ready to either connect to a remote MySQL server (using the installed client), import and query a provided .sql dump (after you upload or place it here), or install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these actions and provide the required information. For each option below I describe exactly what I will run and why; once you confirm and provide any needed credentials/files, I will proceed and then, per your protocol, produce a single SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute (or execute it myself if you give permission to include credentials on the command line).\n\nOptions (choose one):\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server (preferred if database already exists remotely)\n   - You must provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you prefer an interactive prompt), and database name, plus the SQL question.\n   - If you want me to run the SQL from this container, confirm whether I should include the password on the command line (less secure) or you will paste it interactively when prompted. Example command I will run if you allow password on the command line:\n     mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n   - If you prefer not to allow me to include the password, I will run: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p <database>\n     (you will then type the password interactively when prompted).\n   - After connecting, I will execute exactly one SQL statement per your protocol; I will explain the statement first and then present it in one SQL code block for you to execute if you want to run it yourself.\n\n2) Provide a .sql dump to operate on locally\n   - Upload or place the .sql file into the container and tell me its path.\n   - I can either (A) install a local server and import the dump, or (B) search/parse the dump and craft SELECT statements for you to run elsewhere. If you want a local server, confirm below and provide any desired root password.\n   - Commands I will run to import (if you permit local server install): apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server), start the service, then mysql -u root -p to import the dump: mysql -u root -p < /path/to/dump.sql\n\n3) Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container\n   - Confirm you want this and provide desired root password and any database/user names to create.\n   - I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server), initialize/start the service, secure the instance, create the requested user/database, and then run your requested SQL.\n\n4) If you only want help crafting an SQL statement (you will execute it elsewhere)\n   - Provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question. I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in one SQL code block (per your protocol). After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will parse and continue.\n\nSecurity and format notes:\n- If you provide credentials, prefer to let me prompt interactively for passwords rather than embedding them in command lines (embedding is less secure but acceptable if you explicitly permit it).\n- Per your protocol, every time I request the environment to execute SQL I will present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block labeled as the operation. You will execute only the first SQL block and return the raw output, which I will then process.\n\nPlease choose an option and provide the necessary details (remote connection info, path to a .sql dump, or permission to install a local server and any passwords/names). Once you do, I will proceed and show the SQL statement to run (or run it myself if you permit).",
