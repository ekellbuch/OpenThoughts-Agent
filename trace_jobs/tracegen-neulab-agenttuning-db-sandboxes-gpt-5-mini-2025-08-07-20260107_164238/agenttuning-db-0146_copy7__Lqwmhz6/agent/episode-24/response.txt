  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql are absent, no mysqld process is present, and no .sql dump files were found on the filesystem. Nothing is listening on port 3306. You have not provided a SQL question, schema, a .sql dump path, or remote database connection credentials, so I cannot execute any SQL queries yet. What has been done: environment probing and mysql client installation. What remains: you must choose how to proceed and supply the necessary details (remote DB credentials + SQL question; or upload a .sql dump path; or confirm installation of a local server and provide desired root password/user/database; or provide schema + question if you only want SQL crafted).",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Please choose one option and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question. Indicate whether I may embed the password on the command line for noninteractive execution or you prefer interactive entry.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump — upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path. Also tell me whether I should install a local server and import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container — confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any DB/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create DB/user, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here) — provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nAfter you choose and provide required details, I will: (a) explain the SQL I intend to run, and then (b) either present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (c) run the mysql client here if you provided credentials and permitted execution. If you want me to scan the network for reachable MySQL servers first, say so and I will run a brief port scan (requires network access).",
