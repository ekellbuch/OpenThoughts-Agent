  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no MySQL config/data directories, and no .sql dump files were found. You have not provided a SQL question, schema, local dump path, or remote database connection credentials, so no SQL can be executed yet. The environment is ready to (A) connect to a remote MySQL server using the installed client, (B) import/query a provided .sql dump after you place it here, or (C) install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server if you instruct me to do so.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following options and supply the required details. After you choose, I will either (1) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single SQL code block (for you to run elsewhere or here), or (2) run the mysql client from this container to execute the SQL (if you provide connection details and permit me to use them). Options (pick one):\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server: provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer interactive prompt), database name, and state the SQL question you want answered. Also say if I may include the password on the command line or if you will enter it interactively.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump: upload or place the .sql file inside the container and tell me its full path. Also say whether I should install a local server to import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here: confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and any database/user names to create. I will install the server, start it, create the user/database, and run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here): provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nAfter you pick an option and provide the necessary details, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then produce a single SQL statement (in the required format) or run it here if you permitted.",
