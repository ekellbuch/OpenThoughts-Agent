  "analysis": "You are in a container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process is present, and no .sql dumps were found. Because you have not provided a SQL question, a database schema, a .sql dump path, or remote DB connection credentials, I cannot execute any SQL queries yet. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What still needs to be done: you must choose how to proceed and provide the required details (remote DB credentials and the SQL question; or upload a .sql dump path; or confirm installation of a local server and provide desired root password/user/database; or provide schema + question if you only want SQL crafted).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of these options and provide the required details. After you choose I will either (A) craft exactly one SQL statement (in a single SQL code block) for you to execute and then parse the returned output, or (B) run the mysql client here to execute your SQL if you supply connection credentials and permit execution. Options (pick one):\n\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question you want answered. Also indicate if I may include the password on the command line for noninteractive execution.\n\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump — upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path. Also tell me whether to install a local server and import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here — confirm and provide any desired root password and database/user names to create. I will install, start, secure, and create DB/user and then run the SQL you request.\n\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution here) — provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to execute elsewhere.\n\nWhen you provide the details for your chosen option I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then (per your protocol) present exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or I will execute it here if you provided credentials and allowed me to do so.",
