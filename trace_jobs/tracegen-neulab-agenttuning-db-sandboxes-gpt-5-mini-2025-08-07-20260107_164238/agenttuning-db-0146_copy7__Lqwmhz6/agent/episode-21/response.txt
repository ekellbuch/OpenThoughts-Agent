  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or configured: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, there is no mysqld process, and no .sql dump files were found on the filesystem. Nothing is listening on port 3306. No SQL question, schema, dump path, or remote DB connection credentials have been provided, so no SQL can be executed at this time. What has been accomplished: environment probing and installation of the mysql client. What still needs to be done: you must choose how to proceed and supply required details (remote DB credentials and the SQL question; or upload a .sql dump path; or confirm installation of a local server and supply desired root password/user/database; or provide schema + question if you only want SQL crafted).",
  "plan": "Ask you to pick one of four options and provide the required details so I can proceed. Options:\n1) Query a remote MySQL server — provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or state you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the SQL question. Also say whether I may embed the password on the command line if you want me to execute here.\n2) Operate on a local .sql dump — upload/place the .sql file in the container and tell me its full path and whether to install a local server and import it or just craft SQL for you to run elsewhere.\n3) Install a local MySQL/MariaDB server here — confirm and provide any desired root password and DB/user names to create.\n4) Only want SQL written (no execution) — provide the schema (table names and columns) and the question; I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block for you to run.\n\nOnce you choose and provide details, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then either (A) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) run the mysql client here if you supplied credentials and permitted execution. If you want me to scan the network for reachable MySQL servers first, say so and I will perform a brief port scan (requires network access permission).",
