  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. A local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) is installed and running (started with --skip-networking). Datadir: /var/lib/mysql. Socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the MySQL root account currently has no password and can be used locally with: mysql -uroot. A previous test SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. At this moment there is no user-specified database question or SQL to run — the session is idle.",
  "plan": "Tell me the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE mysql.user;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Any DDL/DML (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — state explicitly.\n\nWhen you specify the question I will:\n1) Explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I intend to run.\n2) If an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and put the SQL inside a single markdown SQL code block on one line (per your required format). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block (for example via: mysql -uroot -e \"<SQL>\") and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. I will parse that output, explain results, and either provide another operation or finish with 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]' when certain.",
