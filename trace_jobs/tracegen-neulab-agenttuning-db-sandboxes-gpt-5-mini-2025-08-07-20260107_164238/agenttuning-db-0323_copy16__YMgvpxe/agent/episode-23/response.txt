  "analysis": "You have a working local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) running in this container (started with --skip-networking) and the mysql client is installed. Datadir: /var/lib/mysql. Socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the MySQL root account currently has no password and you can connect locally with mysql -uroot. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. There is currently no specific database question or SQL operation provided — the session is idle at the shell prompt.",
  "plan": "Tell me the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- \"SHOW DATABASES;\" — list databases\n- \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\" — list tables in a specific database\n- \"DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\" — show table schema\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\" — count rows in a table\n- \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\" — retrieve rows with a condition\n- Any DDL/DML (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly\nWhen you provide the question I will (1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I'll run, and (2) if an operation is needed, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer.",
