  "analysis": "A MySQL server is installed and running locally in the container (mysqld started with --skip-networking). The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the root account currently has no password and the mysql client can connect locally via the Unix socket. A test SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user-specified question or SQL operation has been provided yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific database question you want answered (examples: list tables in a schema, show rows matching a condition, count rows, show table schema, run a join/aggregation, or perform an update). Once you give the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and plan for the SQL to run, 2) choose whether to operate or answer directly, and 3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your required pattern (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single markdown code block containing one one-line SQL statement). After you execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will parse it, explain results, and proceed with further operations or produce the final answer using 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]' when certain.",
