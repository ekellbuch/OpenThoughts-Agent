  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server (mysqld) running locally (started with --skip-networking) and the mysql client is installed. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password via the Unix socket. A prior test SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). Right now there is no user-provided database question or SQL to run — the session is idle at the shell prompt.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- List tables in a database: \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\"\n- Describe a table schema: \"DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\"\n- Count rows in a table: \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\"\n- Select rows with a condition: \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\"\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — state explicitly if you want this.\n\nWhen you tell me the question, I will:\n1) Explain the problem and my approach/thinking.\n2) Decide whether to operate (run SQL) or answer directly.\n3) If operating, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your required pattern: a line starting with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block (one-line SQL). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and continue with further steps or deliver the final answer.\n\nIf you want me to run an exploratory query now (for example \"SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\" or \"SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\"), tell me which one and I will produce the single SQL operation in the exact required format.",
