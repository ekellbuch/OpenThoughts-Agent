  "analysis": "MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) is installed and running locally in the container (started with --skip-networking). The datadir is /var/lib/mysql and socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the MySQL root account currently has no password and the mysql client can connect locally as root with: mysql -uroot. A prior check returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been run since the initial tests.",
  "plan": "You need to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can ask for (pick one or specify your own):\n- \"SHOW DATABASES;\" — list databases\n- \"SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\" — list tables in the mysql database\n- \"DESCRIBE mysql.user;\" — show schema of mysql.user\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\" — count rows in a table\n- \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\" — retrieve rows\n- Any DDL/DML (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — state explicitly\nOnce you state the question, I will: (1) explain my approach and reasoning; (2) decide whether to operate (run SQL) or answer directly; (3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer (when I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]').",
