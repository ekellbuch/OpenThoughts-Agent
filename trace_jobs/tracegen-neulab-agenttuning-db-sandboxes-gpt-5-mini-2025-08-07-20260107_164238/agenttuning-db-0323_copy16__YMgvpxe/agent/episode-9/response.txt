  "analysis": "The MySQL server is installed and running locally (started with --skip-networking) and was initialized insecurely, so root can connect with no password via the Unix socket. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet by you.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific database question you want answered. Examples you can ask for: - List all databases or tables in a given database - Show the schema (DESCRIBE) for a table - Count rows in a table or run a SELECT with conditions - Retrieve specific rows or aggregate results - Make data modifications (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) If you want exploratory queries first, choose one of these suggested operations and I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I'll run, 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single one-line markdown code block), and 3) you will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. Based on the output I'll continue with further operations or produce the final answer using 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]'.\n\nPlease tell me which question or which exploratory query you want me to run (for example: \"list tables in the mysql database\", or \"SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\", or \"show rows from some_table where ...\").",
