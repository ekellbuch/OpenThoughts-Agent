  "analysis": "Environment summary: You are at a root shell in /app. A MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) is installed and running (it was started with --skip-networking). The server datadir is /var/lib/mysql and the socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure so the MySQL root account currently has no password and the mysql client (installed) can connect locally via the socket (e.g., mysql -uroot). A prior test SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user-specific databases, tables, or queries have been provided yet; the session is idle and no SQL operation is pending.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- \"SHOW DATABASES;\" — list databases\n- \"SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\" — list tables in a specific database\n- \"DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\" — show table schema\n- \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\" — count rows\n- \"SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\" — retrieve rows with conditions\n- Any DDL/DML (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly\nWhen you specify the question, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I intend to run, and 2) if an operation is required, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer. If you want an exploratory query now, tell me which one and I will provide the single SQL operation in the required format.",
