  "analysis": "You have a functioning local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) running in the container (started with --skip-networking). The server datadir is /var/lib/mysql and the socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure so the MySQL root account currently has no password; the mysql client is installed and can connect locally as root (mysql -uroot). A test SHOW DATABASES previously returned the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user-specific question or SQL operation has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been executed beyond initial verification.",
  "plan": "You need to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Retrieve rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly.\n\nWhen you provide the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I intend to run, and 2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the text 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer (when I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]').",
