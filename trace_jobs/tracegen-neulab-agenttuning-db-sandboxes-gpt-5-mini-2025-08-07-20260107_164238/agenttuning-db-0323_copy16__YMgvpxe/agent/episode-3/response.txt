  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). Previously there was no MySQL server detected on the system (no mysqld process, no sockets, no data files). At this point we have a client but still no server to talk to. To proceed we must either connect to an existing server (local or remote) or install/run a MySQL server locally. Since I don't yet know if there is a server reachable, the next step is to attempt a connection with the client; this will quickly show whether a local server is running and accepting connections (and will produce error details we can use).",
  "plan": "1) Try a simple connection using the mysql client as root to run a basic read-only SQL (SHOW DATABASES). This will show whether a server is present and reachable and will produce an error message if not. 2) If the connection fails, re-check processes and listening sockets to confirm server absence. Based on the results we can either (A) connect to the server and then I will provide the next Action: Operation SQL in the required single-line markdown format, or (B) install/start a server or request connection details if you want to target a remote DB.",
