  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) running with --skip-networking and an initialized datadir (/var/lib/mysql). The mysql client is installed and root can connect with no password via the Unix socket. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user-provided database question or SQL operation has been given—there is nothing further for me to execute against the database until you specify what you want.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Once you specify the question, I will: 1) explain the problem and my approach/thinking; 2) choose whether to operate or answer directly; 3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and containing a single SQL statement inside one markdown SQL code block on one line). After you run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it, explain the results, and either provide another operation or finish with 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]'.\n\nExamples you can request (pick one or state your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM database_name;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE database_name.table_name;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM database_name.table_name;\n- Retrieve rows: SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly.\n\nTell me which operation you want to run now.",
