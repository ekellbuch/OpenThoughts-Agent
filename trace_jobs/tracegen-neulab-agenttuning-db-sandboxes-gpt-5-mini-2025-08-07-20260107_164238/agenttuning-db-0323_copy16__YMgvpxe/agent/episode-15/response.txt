  "analysis": "MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) is installed and running locally in the container (started with --skip-networking). The server datadir is /var/lib/mysql and the socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized insecurely, so the MySQL root account currently has no password and the mysql client can connect locally with: mysql -uroot. A prior test SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user-specific database question or SQL statement has been provided yet, so no SQL has been executed beyond the initial tests.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. After you provide the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and plan for the SQL to run, 2) decide whether to operate or answer directly, and 3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules — preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and containing a single SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block (one-line SQL). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer. Examples of requests you can give me now: - \"List databases\" (SHOW DATABASES;) - \"List tables in database mysql\" (SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;) - \"Describe table mysql.user\" (DESCRIBE mysql.user;) - \"Count rows in mysql.user\" (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;) - \"Select rows from a table with condition\" (specify database.table and condition) - Any DDL/DML (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly If you want exploratory queries to discover tables/schemas first, say which exploratory action you want (for example: 'show tables from mysql;'). If you want me to run a SQL now, tell me exactly which operation and I will output it using the required 'Action: Operation' + single SQL code block format.",
