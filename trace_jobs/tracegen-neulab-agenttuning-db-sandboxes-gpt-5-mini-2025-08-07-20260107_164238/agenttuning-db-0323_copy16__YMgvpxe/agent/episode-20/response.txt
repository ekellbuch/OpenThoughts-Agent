  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app. A local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) was installed, initialized with --initialize-insecure, and started with --skip-networking. Datadir is /var/lib/mysql and socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client is installed and can connect as root without a password (mysql -uroot). A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No user-specified database question or SQL operation has been provided — the session is idle and waiting for your instruction.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE mysql.user;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;\n- Retrieve rows: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Any DDL/DML (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly.\n\nWhen you specify the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I intend to run, and 2) if an operation is required, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules—preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and containing the SQL in a single markdown SQL code block on one line. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer (when I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]').",
