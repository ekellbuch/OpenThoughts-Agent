  "analysis": "You currently have a working local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) running in the container (started with --skip-networking) and the mysql client installed. The server was initialized insecurely so root has no password and you can connect locally with: mysql -uroot. A prior check returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). At this moment you have not provided a specific database question or requested any particular SQL operation — the session is idle at the shell prompt.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Retrieve rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly.\n\nIf you want me to run an exploratory query first, say so (for example: \"Run SHOW DATABASES;\"). If you request an operation I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I'll run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer (when I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]').",
