  "analysis": "The MySQL server is installed and running locally (started with --skip-networking). The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password via the Unix socket. A previous test run of SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no custom queries pending and you have not yet asked a specific database question to answer or operate on.",
  "plan": "Tell me the specific database question you want answered (examples: list all tables in a particular schema, show rows matching a condition in a table, run an aggregation, or modify data). Once you give the question I will: 1) explain the problem and my approach/reasoning; 2) decide whether to operate or answer directly; 3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single markdown code block, one-line statement). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we can produce the final answer. If you want me to perform an initial exploratory query (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM <schema>; or SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table>;) tell me which schema/table or say 'explore' and I will provide the appropriate single SQL operation.",
