  "analysis": "This container is Ubuntu 24.04 and currently has no MySQL/MariaDB client or server installed and no database files or sockets present. I cannot run any SQL yet because there's no mysql client binary available. To proceed with SQL operations I need a client installed (or a running remote server and credentials). Installing a client will let us connect to a local or remote MySQL-compatible server when you provide connection details.",

After that I'll be able to provide an Action: Operation SQL statement for you to execute against a server (local socket or remote host) when you supply connection parameters or if a server is available.",
