  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and a local mysqld is running (you started it). A prior test SHOW DATABASES returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the root account currently has no password and you can connect locally with mysql -uroot. The server was started with --skip-networking, so only local socket connections are possible (no TCP). Datadir is /var/lib/mysql and socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. At this point the environment is ready to run SQL statements locally as root via the socket.",
  "plan": "I need you to ask the specific database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a schema, show rows matching a condition, aggregate data, or modify data). Once you ask, I will: 1) explain the problem and my approach and show my reasoning; 2) choose whether to operate (run SQL) or to answer directly; 3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by the text 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single markdown code block containing one statement on one line). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it, explain results, and either provide another operation or conclude with 'Action: Answer' and a Final Answer array. Please tell me the question and any constraints (which database/schema to use, expected output format, or whether you want only SELECT/read-only queries or modifications).",
