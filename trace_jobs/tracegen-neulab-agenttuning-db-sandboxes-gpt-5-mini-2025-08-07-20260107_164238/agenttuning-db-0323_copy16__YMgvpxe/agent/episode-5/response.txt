  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are now installed and a mysqld process is running (you started it). The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) can connect to the local server via the Unix socket; a test run of SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure (so root has no password) and you started mysqld with --skip-networking, so only local socket connections are possible (no TCP). Datadir: /var/lib/mysql. Socket in the process we started: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. Everything needed to run SQL locally (via the socket) is in place. No further OS-level setup is required unless you want network access or to set a root password.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific question about the database. When you ask a question (for example: list tables in a schema, query rows, aggregate data, or modify data), I will: 1) explain the problem and my approach/thoughts; 2) decide whether to operate (run SQL) or to answer directly; 3) if operating, provide exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block preceded by the text 'Action: Operation' (per your required format). You will execute that SQL and give me the raw MySQL output; I will parse it, explain results, and either submit further operations or finish with an 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]' when certain. Note: because mysqld was started with --skip-networking, any SQL I provide will be executed locally via the socket (mysql -uroot). If you want remote/TCP access, I can reconfigure and restart the server without --skip-networking.",
