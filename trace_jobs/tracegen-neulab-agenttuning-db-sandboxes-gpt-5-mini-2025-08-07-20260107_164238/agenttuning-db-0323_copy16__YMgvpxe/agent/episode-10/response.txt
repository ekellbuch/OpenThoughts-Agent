  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running locally in the container (started with --skip-networking). The server was initialized insecurely, so root can connect with no password via the Unix socket. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet — there is nothing for me to execute against the database until you tell me what you want to do.",
  "plan": "You need to tell me the exact database question or operation you want. Examples you can request (pick one or specify your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Retrieve rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — state that explicitly.\nWhen you tell me which operation you want, I will (1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I'll run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer.",
