There is no information yet about whether a MySQL client or server is installed or running, what credentials exist, or what database/schema we should query. Before issuing any SQL, we need to discover: (1) whether the mysql client is available, (2) whether a mysqld server process is running or a socket is present, and (3) where MySQL configuration/datadir live and what credentials might be usable. Once we have that info we can decide how to connect and then run SQL statements following the required SQL markdown format when performing an Action: Operation.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a mysql client binary and its version. 2) Check for running mysqld processes and listening ports/sockets. 3) Inspect common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql) and config locations (/etc/mysql, /etc/my.cnf) to find sockets or default credentials. 4) If we find a usable socket or an accessible root account without a password, we'll attempt a simple read-only SQL (SHOW DATABASES) in the next step (when you instruct me to run SQL operations I will provide SQL in the exact required format). For now we'll only run system commands to discover environment and not execute SQL yet.",
