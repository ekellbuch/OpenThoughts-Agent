  "analysis": "Current environment: a root shell in /app. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). There is no running mysqld process (ps returned nothing). Common MySQL directories and config files (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql, /etc/my.cnf) did not show content in the previous checks. Therefore there is currently no accessible MySQL server or client detected. Before issuing any SQL I need to discover if any MySQL artifacts (data files, sockets, binaries) exist anywhere on the filesystem or if a package manager is available to install a client or server. I also need to know the OS to choose the right package manager.",
  "plan": "1) Determine OS information to pick package manager or inspect system layout (cat /etc/os-release). 2) Search for alternate MySQL/MariaDB-related binaries (mariadb, mysqladmin, mysqld). 3) Search the filesystem for sockets, InnoDB files, or mysql data directories (mysql.sock, ibdata1, directories named mysql). 4) Check package managers (dpkg/rpm) for installed MySQL packages. Based on results I will either connect to a found socket or install a client (if network and package manager are available) or locate database files to inspect. I will not run any SQL yet; once we have a usable mysql client/socket I will provide the SQL statement in the exact requested format inside a single SQL code block for you to execute.",
