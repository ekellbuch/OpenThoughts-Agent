The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password via the Unix socket.

There is currently no specific database question or SQL operation provided by you — the session is idle at the shell prompt.",

Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Retrieve rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — state explicitly if you want this.\n\nWhen you tell me the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and plan, and 2) if an operation is needed, provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will run only the SQL in the first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we can produce a final answer (using 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]' when certain).",
