  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server (mysqld 8.0) running (started with --skip-networking) and the mysql client is installed. Datadir is /var/lib/mysql and socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure so the MySQL root account currently has no password and you can connect locally with: mysql -uroot. A prior test returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. There is no user-specified database question or SQL to run at this time — the shell is idle at the prompt.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Retrieve rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Make changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — specify explicitly.\n\nWhen you give the question I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I'll run, and (2) if you want me to operate, provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer (when I will output 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]').",
