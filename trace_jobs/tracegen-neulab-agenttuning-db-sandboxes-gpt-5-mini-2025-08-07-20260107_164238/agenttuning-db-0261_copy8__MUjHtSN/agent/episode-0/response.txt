  "analysis": "You haven't provided a specific question about the MySQL database yet. The current shell is a root shell in /app. No prior MySQL commands have been run in this session. Before issuing any SQL, I need to discover whether a MySQL client/server is available, whether a server is running, and where configuration or credentials might be located. That will let me form the proper single-line SQL statement (per your rules) when you give the actual question or when I proceed to operate on the database.",
  "plan": "I'll run a small set of diagnostic shell commands to locate the mysql client, check its version, see if a MySQL/MariaDB server process is running, and list likely config directories and files under /etc and /var/lib. This will tell me how to connect (socket, host/port) and whether I need credentials. I will not execute any SQL yet because you haven't asked the specific question. Commands and expected results:\n- whoami: confirm current user.\n- pwd: confirm current working directory.\n- ls -la: list files in current dir to find any project config containing DB credentials.\n- ls -la /etc | grep -i mysql: check for system MySQL config directory.\n- ls -la /etc/mysql  (if exists): list config files.\n- ls -la /var/lib/mysql (if exists): check for DB data files indicating server presence.\n- which mysql: see if mysql client is installed.\n- mysql --version: show client version if present.\n- ps aux | grep -E \"mysql|mariadb\" | grep -v grep: show running server processes if any.\n- ss -lntp | head -n 20: show listening TCP ports and processes (may reveal a MySQL listener on 3306).\nEach command is short; I'll wait briefly for outputs. After these diagnostics, I'll ask you for the specific question or, if you already provided it elsewhere, I'll craft the single-line SQL statement to run next.",
