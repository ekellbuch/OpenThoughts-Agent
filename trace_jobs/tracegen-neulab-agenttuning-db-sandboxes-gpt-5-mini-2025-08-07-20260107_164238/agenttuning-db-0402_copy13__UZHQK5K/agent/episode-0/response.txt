  "analysis": "The shell is ready at a root prompt in a container. No commands have been run yet in this session, and there's no indication whether a MySQL server or client is installed or running. To proceed with helping operate a MySQL database, I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running, whether the mysql client is available, and where data files or sockets might be located. Once I know those details I can connect and run SQL per your protocol.",
  "plan": "1) Check current user to confirm privileges. 2) Look for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 3) Check listening ports for MySQL (3306) or related service. 4) Inspect typical MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) to see if data exists. 5) Confirm availability and version of the mysql client binary. Based on those results we'll attempt a connection or request credentials/next instructions. Each command is quick and non-blocking.",
