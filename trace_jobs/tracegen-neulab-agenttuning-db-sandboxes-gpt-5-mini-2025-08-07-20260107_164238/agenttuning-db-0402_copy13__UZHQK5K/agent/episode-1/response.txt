  "analysis": "You haven't asked the database question yet. From the shell checks I ran: I'm root in the container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server or client installed (no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql binary, no mysqld process). The environment therefore cannot run or execute MySQL statements locally right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the question you want answered and how you will run SQL (either you'll run the SQL I give you and paste the MySQL output back here, or you want me to install and run a local MySQL server in this container). Options:\n\n- Option A (you run queries): You give me the question and any relevant schema/table names. I will explain my approach, produce a single SQL statement (in one-line SQL inside a code block) for you to execute. You will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer.\n\n- Option B (I prepare the container): I can install a MySQL/MariaDB server or client here and start it so I can run queries locally. That requires package installation (apt-get update; apt-get install mariadb-server or default-mysql-server/client). Tell me if you want me to proceed with installation; if yes, specify whether installing/starting a server in the container is acceptable.\n\nIf you choose Option A, provide the question and any information about the database (table names, schemas, credentials if you want me to craft a connection string). If you choose Option B, confirm and I will run package installation and start-up commands.",
