  "analysis": "A MariaDB server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. I previously verified connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases, tables, or rows beyond the defaults have been inspected because you haven't provided a specific question or requested an operation yet. The environment is ready to run SQL as root (no password) against the local server.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify exactly what you want me to do with the database. Provide one clear request such as:\n- \"List databases\" (I will run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" (I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;)\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" (I will run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;)\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" (I will run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition>;)\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" (I will run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;)\n\nWhen you specify the exact operation (including database, table, columns, conditions, and any LIMIT), I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze the output and either provide another single SQL operation or, when ready, supply the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
