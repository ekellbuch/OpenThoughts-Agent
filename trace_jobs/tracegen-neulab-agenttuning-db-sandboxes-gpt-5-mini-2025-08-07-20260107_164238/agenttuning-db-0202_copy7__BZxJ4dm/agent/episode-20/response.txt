  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. I connected as root (no password) and checked for non-system schemas and tables. Both queries returned no rows, so there are no application databases or tables present — only the default system schemas (mysql, information_schema, performance_schema, sys). In short: the server is healthy and reachable, but there is no user data to query yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want performed. Options:\n- Provide connection details to an external database (host, port, user, password) if you want me to query a remote server.\n- If you want me to query the local MariaDB instance, specify the database/table and the query (examples: \"List tables in database <db>\", \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\", \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\").\n- If you want me to create example data locally so you can run queries against it, confirm and I will create a sample database/table and insert rows.\n\nOnce you specify which of the above you want, I will either (A) Operate — provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute, or (B) Answer — when finished I will provide Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].",
