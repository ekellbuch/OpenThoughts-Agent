You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nI will ask you a question, then you should help me operate a MySQL database with SQL to answer the question.\nYou have to explain the problem and your solution to me and write down your thoughts.\nAfter thinking and explaining thoroughly, every round you can choose to operate or to answer.\nyour operation should be like this:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;\n```\nYou MUST put SQL in markdown format without any other comments. Your SQL should be in one line.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then write down:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\nDO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device\nbash: no job control in this shell\nroot@3d31d3568545:/app#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There is no /var/run/mysqld directory and no mysqld/mariad process is running. No environment variables exposing connection info were found. In short: client is present, server is not reachable from this environment.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"I cannot run any SQL until I can connect to a database. You have two reasonable options; pick one and I will proceed accordingly:\\\\n\\\\nOption A \\u2014 Provide connection details: give me a host (or socket path), port, username and password (or indicate an auth method). Once you supply connection info I will run a single SQL statement (in the required one-line markdown SQL block) to retrieve whatever data you request.\\\\n\\\\nOption B \\u2014 Run a local server inside the container: if you want me to start a local DB server here, I can install and start one. Because this environment doesn't run systemd, starting a server requires invoking the server process directly. If you want me to do that, I will install mariadb-server (or mysql-server) and start the daemon, then connect and run SQL. Example commands I would run if you authorize me to start a local server:\\\\n- apt-get update\\\\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-server\\\\n- mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\\\\n- mysql -uroot -e \\\\\\\"SHOW DATABASES;\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBefore I act, confirm which option you want, and if Option A, provide connection details (host or socket, port, user, password). If you want Option B, confirm and I will proceed to install/start a server and then run SQL. Once you confirm and/or provide credentials I will execute exactly one SQL statement at a time as required.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"annotations\": [], \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1767822408, \"model\": \"gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 966, \"prompt_tokens\": 3490, \"total_tokens\": 4456, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 512, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}",
