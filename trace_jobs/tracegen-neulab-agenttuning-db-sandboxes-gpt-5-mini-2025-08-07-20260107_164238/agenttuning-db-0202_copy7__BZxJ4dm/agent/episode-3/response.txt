Attempts to connect failed with: \"Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)\" and \"Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1:3306' (111)\". There is no /var/run/mysqld directory and no mysqld/mariad process is running. No environment variables exposing connection info were found. In short: client is present, server is not reachable from this environment.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I can connect to a database. You have two reasonable options; pick one and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details: give me a host (or socket path), port, username and password (or indicate an auth method). Once you supply connection info I will run a single SQL statement (in the required one-line markdown SQL block) to retrieve whatever data you request.\n\nOption B — Run a local server inside the container: if you want me to start a local DB server here, I can install and start one. Because this environment doesn't run systemd, starting a server requires invoking the server process directly. If you want me to do that, I will install mariadb-server (or mysql-server) and start the daemon, then connect and run SQL. Example commands I would run if you authorize me to start a local server:\n- apt-get update\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n- mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql &\n- mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\nBefore I act, confirm which option you want, and if Option A, provide connection details (host or socket, port, user, password). If you want Option B, confirm and I will proceed to install/start a server and then run SQL. Once you confirm and/or provide credentials I will execute exactly one SQL statement at a time as required.",
