I verified this earlier by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested an operation yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want. Once you specify, I will either: (a) Operate — produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required Action: Operation format with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (b) Answer — if no more operations are needed, produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer format. Examples of requests you can ask for:\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database X\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM X;\n- \"Show first N rows of X.Y\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM X.Y LIMIT N;\n- \"Count rows in X.Y where condition\" — I'll run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM X.Y WHERE condition;\n- \"Find rows where column = value\" — I'll run an appropriate SELECT with a WHERE clause.\n\nTell me which operation you want (include database/table names and any WHERE conditions or limits). After you confirm, I will provide the single SQL statement to execute.",
