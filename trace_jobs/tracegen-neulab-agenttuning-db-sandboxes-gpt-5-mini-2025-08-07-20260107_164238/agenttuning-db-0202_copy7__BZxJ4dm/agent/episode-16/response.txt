  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container (mariadbd process active) and the mysql client is available. I previously connected as root with no password and confirmed the default system databases exist: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows beyond the defaults have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The environment is ready to run SQL as root (local socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock or 127.0.0.1:3306).",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can request (include database/table names and any WHERE or LIMIT):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" — I'll run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition>;\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;\n\nWhen you specify which operation you want, I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format. If you want me to start with exploration, say \"List databases\" or \"List tables in <db>\" and I will provide the single SQL statement to execute. If you prefer I run an exploratory command now, tell me which one.",
