  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running inside the container and is accessible from this shell as root without a password. I previously started the server (mariadbd) and successfully ran: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected yet because you have not provided a specific question or requested an operation. The environment is ready for executing SQL statements; I will run exactly one SQL statement per your rules when you ask me to operate.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database task you want performed. Give me one of the following (or a similar clear instruction):\n- \"List databases\" (I will run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" (I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;)\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" (I will run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;)\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" (I will run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 1;)\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" (I will run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;)\n\nWhen you tell me which action you want, I will do one of two things in the required format:\n- If I need to execute SQL, I will choose Action: Operation and provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (you will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output).\n- If I am finished and can produce the final results, I will choose Action: Answer and provide: Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...].\n\nPlease specify the database, table, columns, conditions, or the question you want answered. If you want me to begin by listing available databases or tables, say so explicitly.",
