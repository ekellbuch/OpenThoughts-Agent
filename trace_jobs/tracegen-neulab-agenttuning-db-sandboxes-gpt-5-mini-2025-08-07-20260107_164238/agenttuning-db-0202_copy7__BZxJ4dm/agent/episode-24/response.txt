  "analysis": "I created a sample database and verified data. Specifically: a database named 'sampledb' was created, a table 'sampledb.users' (id, name, email, created_at) was created, three rows were inserted (Alice, Bob, Carol), and a SELECT confirmed the rows with timestamps. The MariaDB server is running and accessible as root without a password from this shell. There are currently no other application databases or tables beyond this sample data and the default system schemas.",
  "plan": "Wait for your specific question or request about the database. You can ask for operations such as: listing databases, listing tables in sampledb, selecting rows with conditions, counting rows, updating or deleting rows, or creating additional sample data. When you tell me which operation to perform I will (per your rules) either: \n- Operate: provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze the output and continue.\n- Answer: if no further operations are required, I will return Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].\n\nIf you want me to proceed immediately, here are some suggested operations you can ask for (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" — SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in sampledb\" — SHOW TABLES FROM sampledb;\n- \"Show all users\" — SELECT * FROM sampledb.users;\n- \"Find user with email 'bob@example.com'\" — SELECT * FROM sampledb.users WHERE email='bob@example.com';\n- \"Count users\" — SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sampledb.users;\n\nTell me which of the above (or any other) operation you want me to run. I will then provide the single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format.",
