Each step will be executed with the mysql CLI as root. After you run these commands, you'll have a usable sample dataset and can ask specific questions (counts, filters, etc.).\n\nCommands to run (each is a single mysql -e invocation):\n1) CREATE DATABASE sampledb;\n2) CREATE TABLE sampledb.users (...);\n3) INSERT INTO sampledb.users (...) VALUES (...),(...),(...);\n4) SELECT id,name,email,created_at FROM sampledb.users; (to verify the data)\n\nI expect the SELECT to return three rows for Alice, Bob, and Carol.",
