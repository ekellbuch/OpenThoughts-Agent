That means no mysqld server is running on the local UNIX socket. To proceed we must either locate a running MySQL/MariaDB server (local or remote) or obtain connection details (host, port, user, password). Right now there is no evidence of a local server process. I will probe the environment to find any running MySQL/MariaDB server (processes or TCP listeners), check the mysqld socket directory, attempt a TCP connection to 127.0.0.1:3306, and look for environment variables that might contain DB connection info.",
  "plan": "1) Check running processes to see if mysqld/mariadb is running. 2) Check listening TCP ports for 3306 to find remote/local server. 3) List /var/run/mysqld to see if any socket file exists. 4) Attempt to connect via TCP to 127.0.0.1:3306 with the mysql client to see the error (if any). 5) Inspect environment variables for MYSQL/MARIA/DB related values that might give a host/port/password. Based on the outputs, I'll either connect to the found server or ask you for host/credentials if none is present.",
