  "analysis": "MariaDB is running and reachable as root (no password). A sample database named 'sampledb' exists and contains one table 'users'. The table was populated with three rows (Alice, Bob, Carol) and a SHOW TABLES FROM sampledb; command returned the single table 'users'. No further queries have been run since that check.",
  "plan": "Wait for your instruction about what to do next. Possible next operations (I'll run exactly one SQL statement per your rules when you tell me to operate):\n- Show all rows in the users table: SELECT * FROM sampledb.users;\n- Count users: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sampledb.users;\n- Find a user by email (example bob@example.com): SELECT * FROM sampledb.users WHERE email='bob@example.com';\n- Show table schema: SHOW COLUMNS FROM sampledb.users;\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- Drop the sample database (if you want to remove it): DROP DATABASE sampledb;\n\nTell me which operation you want. When you do, I will respond with Action: Operation and provide a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (that will be the only SQL executed for that round). After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze and continue.",
