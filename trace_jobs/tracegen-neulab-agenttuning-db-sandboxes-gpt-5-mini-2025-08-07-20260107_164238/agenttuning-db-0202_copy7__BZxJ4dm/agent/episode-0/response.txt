To proceed I need to discover what databases exist so I can answer your upcoming question about the database contents. The environment likely allows connecting as the root MySQL user without an interactive password prompt using the mysql CLI, so I'll run a simple SHOW DATABASES query to enumerate available databases.",

I will execute: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which sends the single SQL statement SHOW DATABASES; to the server and prints the result.
