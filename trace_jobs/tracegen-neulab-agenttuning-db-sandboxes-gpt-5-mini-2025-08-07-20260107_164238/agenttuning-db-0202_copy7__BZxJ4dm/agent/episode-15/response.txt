  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in this container (mariadbd process is active) and the mysql client is available. I previously verified connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases/tables/rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The server is reachable as root without a password from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database task you want me to perform. Provide one clear request (include database/table names and any WHERE or LIMIT if applicable). Examples:\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" — I'll run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition>;\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;\n\nWhen you tell me which operation you want, I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL operation or provide the final answer using Action: Answer.",
