  "analysis": "The container has MariaDB installed and running, and the mysql client is available. I connected as root (no password) and confirmed there are only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user/application databases or tables present. You have not yet specified the database question or given connection details to any external database.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want me to do next. Choose one of the following options and I will proceed accordingly:\n\n1) Query the local MariaDB instance (you should specify the exact query or the target database/table and any conditions). If you want me to run SQL here, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format and you will execute it.\n\n2) Connect to a remote/external MySQL/MariaDB server you control — provide host, port (if not 3306), username, and password (or other auth method). After you provide credentials I will issue the single SQL statement you request (in the required format).\n\n3) Create example/sample data locally so you can exercise queries against it. If you choose this, confirm and I'll create a sample database/table and insert rows; then I can run the specific queries you request.\n\n4) If your goal is to modify the server (create users, change configuration), describe the exact changes you want.\n\nTell me which option you want and give details (database/table names, SQL to run, or external connection credentials). Once you specify, I will either (A) Operate — provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (B) Answer — if no further operations are needed, provide the final answer using Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].",
