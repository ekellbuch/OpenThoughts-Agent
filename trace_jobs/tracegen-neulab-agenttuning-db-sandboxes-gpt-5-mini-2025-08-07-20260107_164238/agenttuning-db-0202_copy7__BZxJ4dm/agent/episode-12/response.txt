  "analysis": "A MariaDB server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. I previously started mariadbd and confirmed connectivity by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows beyond the defaults have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The server is reachable as root with no password from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database task you want me to perform. Give one clear instruction such as:\n- \"List databases\" (I will run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" (I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;)\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" (I will run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;)\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" (I will run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition>;)\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" (I will run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;)\n\nWhen you specify which operation you want, I will (per your rules) produce Action: Operation followed by exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request/produce another single SQL operation or, when ready, produce the final answer using Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].",
