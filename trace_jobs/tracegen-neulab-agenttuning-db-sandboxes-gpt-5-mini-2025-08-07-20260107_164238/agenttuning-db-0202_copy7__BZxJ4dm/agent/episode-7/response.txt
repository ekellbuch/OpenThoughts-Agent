I previously verified connectivity with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet, and you have not asked a specific database question to answer or requested a particular operation.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific question about the database. When you give a question (for example: list tables in a database, show rows from a table, count rows matching a condition, or modify data), I will follow the required workflow: choose to operate (produce exactly one SQL statement in the specified markdown format) or answer (when finished), and provide the single SQL statement to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or produce the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
