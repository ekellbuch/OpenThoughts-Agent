  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. I previously started mariadbd and confirmed connectivity by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows beyond the defaults have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The server is reachable as root without a password from this shell (via the local socket and 127.0.0.1:3306).",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database task you want me to perform. Examples you can request (include database/table names and any conditions or limits):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" — I'll run SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" — I'll run SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition>;\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" — I'll run SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;\n\nWhen you specify the operation I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, when ready, provide the final answer using Action: Answer.",
