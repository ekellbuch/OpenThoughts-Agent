  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client, discovered no server was running, then installed and started MariaDB in this container. I started the server with mysqld_safe; a mariadbd process is now running. I verified the server by running mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. At this point the server is accessible as root with no password from the container (local unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock / TCP 127.0.0.1:3306), so I can run SQL statements against it. No user-provided question or target database/table has been given yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question or instructions about what data to retrieve or modify. Tell me what you want to find (for example: list tables in a specific database, show rows matching a condition, count rows, or modify data). Once you specify the question, I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL block). That SQL will be the only statement executed in that round. After you run it and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either run another single SQL statement or, when confident, provide the final answer (Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...]).",
