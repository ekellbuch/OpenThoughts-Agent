I previously started mariadbd and verified connectivity with: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows beyond the defaults have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The server is reachable as root without a password from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database task you want performed. Once you tell me the question, I will either: (A) Operate — provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (B) Answer — if no more operations are needed, provide the final answer with Action: Answer. Examples you can request (include database/table names and any conditions or limits):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Show first N rows of <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> LIMIT N;\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table> where <condition>\" — I'll run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition>;\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <column> = '<value>' LIMIT 100;\n\nTell me which operation you want (with database/table names and any WHERE/LIMIT details). After you specify, I will provide the single SQL statement to run.",
