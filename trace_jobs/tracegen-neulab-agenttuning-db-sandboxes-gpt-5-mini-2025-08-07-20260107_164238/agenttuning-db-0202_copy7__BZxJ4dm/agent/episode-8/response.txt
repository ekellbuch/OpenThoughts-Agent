I previously verified this with SHOW DATABASES; which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or data have been inspected yet because you have not provided a specific question or requested an operation.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact database question or the action you want me to take. Examples you can ask for:\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database X\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM X;\n- \"Show first N rows of X.Y\" — I'll run: SELECT * FROM X.Y LIMIT N;\n- \"Count rows where condition\" — I'll run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM X.Y WHERE condition;\n- \"Find rows where column = value\" — I'll run a SELECT with that WHERE clause.\n\nWhen you specify the request, I will choose to operate and provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output to me. After that I will analyze the output and either run another single SQL statement or, when confident, provide the final answer with Action: Answer. Please tell me which of the example actions (or your own) you want me to perform and include database/table names and any conditions or limits.",
