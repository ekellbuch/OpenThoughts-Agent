  "analysis": "The mysql client is not installed in this container (previous attempt returned 'mysql: command not found'). No databases have been inspected yet. To run SQL against the MySQL server you need a MySQL client (or another way to reach the server). I'll try to install a MySQL client package and then run SHOW DATABASES to discover available databases. If the container has no network or apt is unavailable, the install may fail and we'll need an alternate approach.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists (apt-get update) so we can install packages. 2) Install the default MySQL client (default-mysql-client) which provides the mysql CLI. 3) Run mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to list databases. After you return the output of that command, I'll analyze databases and propose the next SQL operation in the required SQL markdown format.",
