I connected as root (no password) and confirmed there are only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user/application databases or tables present. You have not provided a specific database question, nor connection details to any external database, and you have not authorized creation of sample data locally.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of these next steps so I can proceed:\n1) Provide a specific query or question about the (local) database you want answered. If you want me to run SQL here, specify the exact database/table and the query or the type of information (e.g., \"List tables in database X\", \"Show first 10 rows of X.Y\", \"Count rows where ...\"). I will then produce a single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format.\n2) Provide connection details (host, port if not 3306, username, password) for a remote MySQL/MariaDB server if you want me to query an external database.\n3) Ask me to create sample data locally; confirm and specify schema/table/rows and I will create them, then run the requested query.\n\nOnce you pick option 1, 2, or 3 (and give the necessary details), I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. After you return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either run another single SQL operation or, when ready, provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
