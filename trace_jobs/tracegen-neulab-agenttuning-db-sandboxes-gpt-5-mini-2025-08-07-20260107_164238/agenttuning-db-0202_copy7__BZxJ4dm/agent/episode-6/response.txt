I verified connectivity by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The server listens on the container's socket (/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) and is reachable as root without a password from this shell. No application-specific databases or tables beyond the defaults have been inspected yet. You have not yet provided a specific question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "Wait for your question or instruction about what to retrieve or modify. When you give the question, I will: 1) Choose to either operate (run a single SQL statement) or answer (produce the final answer). 2) If operating, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output to me. 3) I will analyze the output and either run another single SQL operation or, when confident, return the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.\n\nIf you want me to start by listing databases/tables or show rows from a particular table, tell me which database/table and what condition to use. Example requests you can make: \"List tables in database X\", \"Show first 10 rows of table Y\", \"Find rows where column Z = 'value'\", or \"Count rows in table T\". After you specify, I'll provide the single SQL statement to run.",
