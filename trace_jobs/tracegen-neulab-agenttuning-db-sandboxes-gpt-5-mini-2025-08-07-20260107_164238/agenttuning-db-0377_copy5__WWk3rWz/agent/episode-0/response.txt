  "analysis": "I am at a shell prompt (root@a1c9439961a3:/app#). No MySQL client is running and no SQL has been executed yet. There is no question from you yet about the database, and no database connection details (host/port/user/password/database) have been provided. Nothing has been changed or accomplished so far.",
  "plan": "I will first need you to provide the specific question you want answered about the MySQL database and the connection details (host, port, username, password, database name) or tell me how to access the database from this environment. Once you provide that, I will: 1) craft a single SQL statement that answers the question, presented exactly in the required format (Action: Operation and a single SQL statement in a single-line Markdown code block); 2) you will execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output back to me; 3) I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement (repeat) or conclude and provide the final answer in the exact required format (Action: Answer with Final Answer list). If you want me to attempt to connect from this shell first, provide credentials and I will run the appropriate mysql client command. If you prefer to run SQL yourself, provide the question and I will send the single SQL statement to execute.",
