  "analysis": "The mysql client is not installed in this container (mysql: command not found). The shell is at a ready prompt (root@a1c9439961a3:/app#). No database queries have been run and no connection details or question have been provided yet. To proceed with issuing SQL statements from this environment I need a MySQL client or another way to connect to the database. Installing the client is the straightforward next step.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client in the container so we can connect to the database from the shell. I will update apt package lists and install the default MySQL client package. 2) Verify the mysql client is now available and print its version. 3) After installation and verification, I'll wait for you to provide the database question or connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database). Commands to run:\n- apt-get update (refresh package lists)\n- apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (install the client)\n- which mysql (confirm binary path)\n- mysql --version (confirm version)\nExpected results: the install completes and mysql becomes available; then I will prompt you for the database question or credentials so I can produce the single SQL statement you requested.",
