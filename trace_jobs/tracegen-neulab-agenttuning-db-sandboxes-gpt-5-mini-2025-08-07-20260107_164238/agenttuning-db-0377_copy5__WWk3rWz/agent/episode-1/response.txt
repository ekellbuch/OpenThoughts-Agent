  "analysis": "The shell is at a ready prompt (root@a1c9439961a3:/app#). No MySQL client is running, no SQL has been executed, and you have not yet provided a database question or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database). Nothing has been changed or accomplished in this session so far.",
  "plan": "I need the specific question you want answered about the MySQL database and how you'd like me to proceed:\n\n- If you want me to produce a single SQL statement for you to run here, tell me the question (for example: \"List users with more than 10 orders\" or \"What is the total sales per month?\"). I will then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that and paste the raw MySQL output back to me, and I will analyze it and either issue another Operation or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.\n\n- If you want me to run queries from this shell, provide connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database) or tell me to use local socket. I can then run the mysql client here. Example connection command I would run (once you provide credentials): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE\n\n- If you prefer to let me first check whether the mysql client is installed in this container, I can run which mysql and mysql --version. Tell me which of the above you prefer.\n\nNext actions I will take depend on your choice. If you ask me to produce a query now, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format and no other text except the required explanatory analysis/plan/commands JSON fields. If you provide credentials and want me to connect, I'll run the mysql client and proceed to fetch schema or run the query you request.",
