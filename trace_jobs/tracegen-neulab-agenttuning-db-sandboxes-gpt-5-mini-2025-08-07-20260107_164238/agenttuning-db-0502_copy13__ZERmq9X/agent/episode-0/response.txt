  "analysis": "Current terminal shows a root shell in /app with no active commands. No database question has been provided yet. I have not executed any SQL. Before I can run SQL operations I need the user's question and connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or confirm that a local MySQL server is available and accessible without a password. I also note the task rules: every operation must be presented as Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (the system will execute only the first SQL code block). When finished I must output Action: Answer with Final Answer array. Right now, we need to (1) confirm availability of the mysql client and server, (2) get the user's database question and credentials (if necessary), and then (3) craft and run one SQL statement per round, explaining reasoning before each operation.",
  "plan": "1) Prompt the user to provide their database question and connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If they want me to try a local MySQL instance, I'll first check whether the mysql client exists and whether a mysqld process is running. 2) Once I have the question and connection details (or confirm local access), I'll formulate the appropriate SQL. I will explain my reasoning and then provide exactly one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block prefixed by Action: Operation. After you run that SQL and return the output, I'll analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or, if done, return Action: Answer with the final answer array. The commands I will run now will only check for the mysql client and a running server, and will print a prompt telling you what I need.",
