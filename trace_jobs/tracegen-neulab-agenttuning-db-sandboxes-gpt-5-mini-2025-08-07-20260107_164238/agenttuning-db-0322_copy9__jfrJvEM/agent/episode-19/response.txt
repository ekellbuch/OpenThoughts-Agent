A root connection without password works (mysql -uroot), and SHOW DATABASES returned the system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases or user-provided SQL question have been processed yet.",
  "plan": "You should tell me the exact SQL question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, show rows matching a condition, count rows, describe schema, etc.). I will then:\n1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I will run.\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You will execute that SQL (I will only put one statement in the first SQL code block) and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse the output and continue until you tell me to finish, at which point I will provide the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also run a quick discovery query first (e.g., list tables in a specific database). If so, tell me which database (for example: mysql). If you want me to proceed now to list tables in a given database, say so and I will produce the single SQL statement accordingly.",
