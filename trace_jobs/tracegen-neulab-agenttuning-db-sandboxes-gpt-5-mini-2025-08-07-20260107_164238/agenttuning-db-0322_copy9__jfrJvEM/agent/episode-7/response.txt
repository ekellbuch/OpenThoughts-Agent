  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0) but there is no MySQL server or database files present. Earlier checks found: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql/mariadb processes, no 3306 listener, no credential files (~/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/debian.cnf), and no SQL/db dump files. Therefore there is currently no target database to run SQL against. No SQL statements have been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run further shell commands until you decide how to proceed. You have three choices:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server you control: provide connection details (host or socket, port if not 3306, username, password if any, and database name if applicable) and the exact SQL question. I will then produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute here.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container: if you want this, tell me to proceed and provide any desired root password and optional initial database/user. I will install and initialize a server and then run SQL locally.\n\nOption C — Search further for credentials or dumps on the filesystem: authorize wider find/grep commands and I will attempt to locate any hidden DB artifacts or secrets.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply any required details (connection info or passwords). After that I will either run the chosen shell commands or produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) as required by your protocol.",
