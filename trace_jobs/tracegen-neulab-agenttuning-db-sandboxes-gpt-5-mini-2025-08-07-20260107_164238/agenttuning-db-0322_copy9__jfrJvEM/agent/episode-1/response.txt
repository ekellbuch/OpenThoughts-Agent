  "analysis": "So far we confirmed: current working dir is /app (empty). The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). No mysql/mariadb server process is running, no listening 3306 socket, and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf or root's ~/.my.cnf were not present. No .cnf files were found under /etc besides OpenSSL. In short: there is no visible MySQL client or server on this container, and no obvious configuration files containing credentials. To run SQL against a MySQL instance we need either: (A) an installed mysql client and a running server/socket plus credentials, or (B) a database file (e.g., SQLite or SQL dump) present in the filesystem that we can query or inspect. None of these are yet discovered.",
  "plan": "Probe the filesystem and environment for any database artifacts or credentials and check whether MySQL/MariaDB packages are installed. Specifically I'll:\n1) Check /var/lib/mysql to see if a server data directory exists.\n2) Search for directories named 'mysql' to find data or socket locations.\n3) Inspect environment variables for any DB-related settings (like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, DATABASE_URL).\n4) Search for SQL dump files (*.sql) and common DB files (*.db, *.sqlite*) in the filesystem.\n5) Check installed packages for mysql/mariadb to know whether we can install/use a local client or server.\n6) Look for Docker secrets ( /run/secrets ) which might contain credentials.\nThese probes will tell us whether we can connect to an existing MySQL instance or need to install a client or look for alternate DB files. I'll run the commands below to gather this information.",
