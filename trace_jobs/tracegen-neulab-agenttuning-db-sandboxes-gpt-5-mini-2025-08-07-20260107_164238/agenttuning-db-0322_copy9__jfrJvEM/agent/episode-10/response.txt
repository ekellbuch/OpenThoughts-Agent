  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0), but there is no MySQL server or database files present in this environment. Earlier checks showed: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql/mariadb processes, no 3306 listener, no credential/config files (~/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/debian.cnf), and no SQL/database dump files. Therefore there is currently no target database to run SQL against from this session. No SQL statements have been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one of the following options and provide the requested information so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server: provide host (or socket), port (if not 3306), username, password (if any), and the database name (optional). Also state the exact SQL question you want answered. Once you provide that, I will produce one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container: confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and optional initial database/user. I will install and initialize a server, start it, and then run SQL locally as you request.\n\nOption C — Search more extensively for credentials or database dumps on the filesystem: authorize a broader search and I will run find/grep commands to try to locate hidden .cnf files, SQL dumps, or secrets.\n\nTell me which option you choose and include any needed connection details or choices. After you reply, I will either run the necessary shell commands or produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.",
