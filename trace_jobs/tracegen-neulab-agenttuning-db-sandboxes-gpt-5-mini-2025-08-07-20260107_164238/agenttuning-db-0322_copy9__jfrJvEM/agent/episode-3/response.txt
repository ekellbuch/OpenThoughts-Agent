  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client (mysql) successfully. Previously we verified there was no MySQL server, no /var/lib/mysql, no listening 3306, and no credential/config files. The environment now has the mysql CLI available (mysql --version confirmed). What remains: there is still no connection to a MySQL server: I do not have the host/port (or socket), username, password, or target database to run any SQL against. Without those connection details (or a local server/data directory), I cannot execute SQL queries yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide connection details for the target MySQL server. Provide one of these sets of information:\n- Hostname/IP, port (usually 3306), username, password, and database name (or leave database blank to list/choose), or\n- A Unix socket path plus username/password/database, or\n- If you want me to run SQL against a local server, I can install and initialize a server (but that will create a new, empty DB).\nOnce you provide connection info I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown). I will also explain my reasoning before choosing to operate, as you requested.\nIf you want me to attempt an automatic connection probe, say so and provide at least username and host (or allow me to try root@localhost with no password).",
