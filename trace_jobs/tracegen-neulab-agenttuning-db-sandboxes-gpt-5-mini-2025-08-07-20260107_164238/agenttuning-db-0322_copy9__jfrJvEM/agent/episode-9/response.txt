  "analysis": "Summary of current state: the container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0), but there is no MySQL server running here and no database files or credential files were found. Specifically: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql/mariadb processes, no 3306 listener, no ~/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, and no SQL dump or SQLite files discovered. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database from this environment because there is no target database connection or data available.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL yet because I need a target database. You must choose one of these options; after you choose I will proceed as described:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n  - Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (if any), and database name (optional). Also state the exact SQL question you want answered (for example: list tables in DB, select rows matching a condition, aggregate, etc.).\n  - Once you provide connection details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You will execute that SQL here and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse and continue.\n  - Local command template I would use (do not run until you authorize):\n    mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container (new empty DB):\n  - If you want this, tell me to proceed and provide any desired root password and optional initial database/user to create.\n  - I will install and initialize a server (apt install), start it, create the requested user/database, and then run SQL locally. This produces a fresh instance (no existing data).\n\nOption C — Let me search more extensively for credentials or DB dumps on the filesystem:\n  - Authorize a broader search (I will run additional find/grep commands across the filesystem). If any credentials or dumps are found, I can try to connect or inspect them.\n\nNotes and constraints:\n  - Per your protocol, every time I produce SQL it must be exactly one statement inside the first SQL code block; you will execute only that block. I will therefore produce a single-line SQL statement when asked to operate.\n  - If you post credentials here, they will appear in the session; prefer temporary/test credentials if possible.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (connection info for Option A; desired root password/user/db for Option B; or permission to run a deeper filesystem search for Option C). After that I will either run the necessary shell commands (if you pick B or C) or produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute.",
