  "analysis": "Current container has no MySQL client or server installed or running. mysql command is not found, there is no /var/lib/mysql, no listening 3306 socket, no credential files like /etc/mysql/debian.cnf or ~/.my.cnf, and no SQL/DB files were discovered. To execute SQL statements against a MySQL server we need a MySQL client and connection details (host, port, username, password or socket). Nothing has been accomplished toward connecting yet.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client in this container so we can run SQL statements when you provide connection details. Steps:\n1) Update apt package index (apt-get update) so we can install packages.\n2) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so the mysql command becomes available.\n3) Verify the mysql client is installed (mysql --version).\nAfter the client is available, you must provide the target MySQL server connection info (host/port or socket, username, password, and database). Once you provide credentials I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required markdown format for you to execute. If apt installation fails (no network or package manager), we'll adapt accordingly.",
