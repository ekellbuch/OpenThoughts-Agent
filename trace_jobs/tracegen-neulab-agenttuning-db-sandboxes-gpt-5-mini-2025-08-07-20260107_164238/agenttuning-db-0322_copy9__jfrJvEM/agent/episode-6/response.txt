  "analysis": "The environment currently has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0) but there is no MySQL server running or visible in this container (no /var/lib/mysql, no 3306 listener, no credential/config files or DB dumps were found). Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL statements — there is no target database connection. No SQL operations have been run yet. The next action depends on whether you have an existing MySQL server to connect to or want a local server created here.",
  "plan": "I will not run more commands until you choose one of these options. For each option I describe the exact next steps so you can authorize them:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (if any), and database name (optional). Also tell me the SQL question you want answered (e.g., list tables, select rows matching a condition, aggregate, etc.).\n- Once you provide those, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute that SQL (I will only provide one statement per round), paste the raw mysql output back, and I will parse and continue.\n\nExample of the mysql client command I would run here after you give credentials (I will not run it until you confirm):\nmysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container (will be a new empty DB):\n- Tell me to proceed and provide any desired root password and initial database/user to create.\n- I will install and initialize a server (apt install mariadb-server or mysql-server), start it, create the requested user/database, then run SQL locally.\n\nOption C — Continue searching for credentials or DB dumps on the filesystem:\n- If you prefer, I can run more extensive searches (wider find, grep for credential patterns, check more paths). This may find hidden .cnf files, dumps, or secrets.\n\nSecurity note: If you post credentials here, they will appear in the session; prefer temporary/test credentials if possible.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and, for Option A, the connection details and the exact SQL question to answer; for Option B, the desired root password and initial DB/user names; or for Option C, permission to run broader filesystem searches.",
