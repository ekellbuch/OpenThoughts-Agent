  "analysis": "The shell shows we are root in /app with no prior commands executed in this session (messages about terminal control at top). There is currently no information about a running MySQL server, credentials, or database schema. Before we can run SQL statements (per your protocol) we need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is present, how to connect (socket/port and credentials), and any .my.cnf or other config files that might contain credentials. Nothing has been accomplished yet toward connecting to a database.",
  "plan": "Probe the environment to find MySQL client/version, any running MySQL/MariaDB process, listening MySQL ports/sockets, and possible configuration files that may contain connection credentials (/etc/mysql/debian.cnf, ~/.my.cnf, other .cnf files). Steps and expected results:\n1) Show current directory and listing to confirm working path.\n2) Check mysql client version to see if client is installed.\n3) Look for running mysql/mariadb processes (ps) to see if server is running.\n4) List listening TCP sockets to find mysql port (3306) and process info.\n5) Try to display /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which often contains administrative credentials in some containers.\n6) Check for ~/.my.cnf in root or app user home for saved credentials.\n7) Search for other .cnf files (like /etc/mysql/*.cnf) for possible credentials or socket paths.\nI will run a sequence of short commands to gather this information. After we have connection details, I'll prepare the SQL operation you require following your required format.",
