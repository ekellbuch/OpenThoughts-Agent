  "analysis": "MariaDB server is now running locally (mysqld started manually with --skip-networking and user mysql). The datadir (/var/lib/mysql) was initialized by the package and contains system databases (mysql, performance_schema, sys). A test connection as root without a password succeeded and returned the server version. SHOW DATABASES; returned the expected system databases. There is currently no non-system user database present. No user-specified SQL question has been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I'm ready to run SQL against this local MariaDB instance as root (no password). Per your protocol, when you ask a question I will think through and explain my approach, then either (A) produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute, or (B) if you want me to operate directly here in the shell, I can run mysql -uroot -e \"<SQL>\" and return results. Tell me the exact SQL question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, SELECT rows matching a condition, count rows, etc.).\n\nIf you wish, I can also run some helpful discovery queries now (examples):\n- Show tables in a specific database: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW TABLES FROM database_name;\"\n- Show CREATE TABLE for a table: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW CREATE TABLE database_name.table_name;\"\n- Run an arbitrary SELECT: mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT ...;\"\n\nTell me which query you want. If you want me to run a discovery query first (e.g., list tables in the mysql or sys database), specify which database. Once you confirm the exact operation, I will either (1) produce the single SQL statement in the required markdown format (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (2) run the command here in the shell if you prefer that I execute it directly.",
