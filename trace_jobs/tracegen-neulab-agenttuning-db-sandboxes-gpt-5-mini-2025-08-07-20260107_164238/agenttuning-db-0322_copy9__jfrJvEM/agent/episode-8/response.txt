  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0), but there is no MySQL server or database files present in this environment. Previous checks showed no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql/mariadb processes, no 3306 listener, no credential/config files (~/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/debian.cnf), and no SQL/database dump files. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against an existing database from here without connection details or installing/initializing a local server. No SQL statements have been executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. You can choose one of these options and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (if any), and database name (optional). Also state the exact SQL question you want answered. I will then produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container (will be a fresh empty DB):\n  - Confirm you want this and provide any desired root password and optional initial database/user to create. I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the user/database, and then run SQL locally as requested.\n\nOption C — Search further for credentials or database dumps on the filesystem:\n  - Authorize a broader filesystem search (I will run find/grep across more paths) to try to locate hidden .cnf files, SQL dumps, or secrets that might allow connecting to an existing DB.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply any required details (connection info or desired local DB credentials). After you reply, I will run the necessary shell commands (if installing or searching) or produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. I will not run further commands until you instruct me which option to take.",
