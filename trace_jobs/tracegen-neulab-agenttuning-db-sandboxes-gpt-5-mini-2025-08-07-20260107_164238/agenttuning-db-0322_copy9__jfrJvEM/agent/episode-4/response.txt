  "analysis": "Current state: the container is at /app and I installed the MySQL client successfully (mysql 8.0 available). There is still no MySQL server/process detected in the container and no database files or credential files were found earlier. That means I cannot run any SQL against a database until you provide connection details (host, port or socket, username, password, and optionally database), or until you ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server (which would create a new empty database instance). I have not executed any SQL statements yet because there's no target DB connection information.",
  "plan": "I will not run further shell commands until you tell me which of the following you want:\n\nOption A (preferred if you have an existing DB): Provide connection details for the target MySQL server. I need at least host (or socket) and username; password and database name are usually required. Once you provide them, I will:\n  - Form a single SQL statement for the operation you request and present it in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; then I will parse it and continue.\n\nWhen you provide connection info I will use the mysql client with a command like:\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nOption B (if you want a local DB inside this container): I can install a server (e.g., mariadb-server or mysql-server), initialize it, start it, create a user/database, and then run SQL. That will produce a fresh empty DB (not your existing data). If you choose this, tell me and I will run the apt install and initialization commands.\n\nOption C (if you want me to search further): I can keep searching the filesystem or environment for credentials or DB dumps—tell me to proceed and I will run additional find/grep commands.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and, if Option A, provide the connection details (host, port, username, password if any, and database name if known) along with the exact SQL question you want answered. After you provide that, I will produce the single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.",
