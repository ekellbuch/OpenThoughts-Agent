  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and available (mysql 8.0). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running in this container, no /var/lib/mysql, no credential files, and no database files were found earlier. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a remote or local server from here until I have connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, and optionally database) or until you ask me to install and initialize a local server (which would create a new empty DB). No SQL has been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction which must choose one of the following:\n\n1) Provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host or socket, port if not 3306, username, password if any, and database name if known). Once you provide them and state the SQL question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will then parse and continue.\n\n2) Ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container. If you choose this I will run apt install for a server package, initialize and start it, create any user/database you request, and then run SQL locally. Inform me if you want a specific root password or database/user setup.\n\n3) Ask me to keep searching the filesystem for database dumps or secrets. If so I will run additional find/grep commands to look for SQL dumps, credentials, or other artifacts.\n\nIf you choose Option 1, I will also show the exact mysql client command I will use to run the SQL (so you can run it here). If you choose Option 2 or 3, I will run the necessary shell commands.\n\nTell me which option you want and provide any required connection details or choices. I will not run any more commands until you respond.",
