  "analysis": "The MariaDB server package was installed, and /var/lib/mysql contains an initialized datadir. Earlier attempts to start the server via package scripts were blocked by policy-rc.d, so the server did not auto-start. A manual attempt to run mysqld --skip-networking --user=mysql produced logs but failed with: \"Can't start server : Bind on unix socket: No such file or directory\" and \"Do you already have another server running on socket: /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock ?\". That indicates the expected socket parent directory (/run/mysqld) did not exist or was not writable by the mysql user. To proceed we must create /run/mysqld, set ownership to mysql:mysql, and then start mysqld manually (e.g., with --skip-networking at first). After starting, we should verify the server is running and connect locally with the mysql client to run SELECT VERSION().",
  "plan": "1) Check whether /run/mysqld exists. 2) Create /run/mysqld and set ownership to mysql:mysql. 3) Start the MariaDB server manually in the background with networking disabled to avoid binding TCP initially: mysqld --skip-networking --user=mysql &. 4) Wait briefly, check listening sockets/process, and then try to connect locally via socket with mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" to verify the server is up. If this succeeds we will be ready to run further SQL per your instructions.",
