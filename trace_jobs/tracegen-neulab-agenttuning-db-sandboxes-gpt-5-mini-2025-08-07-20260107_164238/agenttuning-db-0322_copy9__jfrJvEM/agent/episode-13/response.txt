  "analysis": "So far we have the mysql client installed in the container (mysql 8.0). There is no remote or local MySQL server running or data files present. To be able to run SQL queries from this environment we must either connect to an external MySQL server (you provide host/port/user/password/database) or create a local server inside the container. You haven't provided connection details, so the next practical step is to create and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here so we can run SQL locally. After starting a local server we can create databases/users and run SQL. No SQL statements have been executed yet against any database.",
  "plan": "Install a local MariaDB server (lightweight drop-in replacement for MySQL), ensure the runtime directory exists and is writable, start the server, and verify we can connect with the mysql client as root. Steps and expectations:\n1) apt-get install -y mariadb-server — install the server package so we can run a local DB.\n2) Ensure /var/run/mysqld exists and is owned by the mysql user — prevents start failures.\n3) Start the mysql service (service mysql start). If the service script works it will start the daemon.\n4) Check for a listening MySQL socket/port to confirm server started.\n5) Attempt to connect as root with the mysql client and run a simple SELECT VERSION() to verify functionality.\nIf the server starts and we can connect, tell me what query or database operations you want next. If you prefer a different option (connect to a remote server or only search for DB dumps/credentials), tell me and I'll stop and follow that path instead.",
