  "analysis": "We successfully installed a MySQL client and then installed MariaDB server. The package scripts could not start the service automatically (policy-rc.d), so we created /run/mysqld, set ownership, and started mysqld manually with --skip-networking --user=mysql. The server started and is ready for connections via the Unix socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A test connection as root (no password) succeeded and returned the server version (10.11.13-MariaDB...). The MariaDB data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is present and contains the system schemas (mysql, performance_schema, sys). At this point we can run SQL against the local server as root without a password. No user-provided SQL question has been executed yet.",
  "plan": "Verify the server process and listening sockets, then list the existing databases so we know the current DB state before performing any further operations. After you provide the SQL question you want answered, I will prepare a single SQL statement in the required format. Next commands will:\n1) Show mysqld/mariadb process information (ps) to confirm it's running. 2) Show listening sockets to confirm socket/port. 3) Run a MySQL client command to list databases (SHOW DATABASES;).",
