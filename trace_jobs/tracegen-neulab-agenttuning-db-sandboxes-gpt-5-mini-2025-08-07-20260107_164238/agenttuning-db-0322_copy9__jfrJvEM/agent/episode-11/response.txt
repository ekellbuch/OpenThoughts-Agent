  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0) but no MySQL/MariaDB server, no database files, and no credential/config files were found. Specifically: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql/mariad process, no 3306 listener, and no ~/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/debian.cnf. Therefore there is no reachable target database from this environment and no SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any shell commands until you choose how to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details so I can act:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n  - Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (if any), and database name (optional). Also tell me the exact SQL question you want answered (e.g., list tables, SELECT with condition, aggregate).\n  - After you provide details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL here and paste the raw mysql output back; I will parse and continue.\n  - Example local mysql client command I would run (I will not run it until you confirm):\n    mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container (fresh empty DB):\n  - If you want this, confirm and provide a desired root password and optional initial database/user to create.\n  - I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then run SQL locally.\n\nOption C — Search more extensively for credentials or DB dumps on the filesystem:\n  - If you authorize, I will run broader find/grep commands to look for hidden .cnf files, SQL dumps, Docker secrets, or other artifacts that could provide connection info.\n\nSecurity note: If you supply credentials here they will appear in the session; prefer temporary/test credentials if possible.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required connection details or choices. If you choose Option A, also give the exact SQL question you want answered so I can produce the single SQL statement in the required format.",
