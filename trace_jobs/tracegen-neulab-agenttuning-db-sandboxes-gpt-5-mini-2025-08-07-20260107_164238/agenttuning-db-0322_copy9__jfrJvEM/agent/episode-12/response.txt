  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0) but there is no MySQL server or database files present in this environment. Earlier checks found: no /var/lib/mysql, no mysql/mariadb processes, no 3306 listener, no credential/config files (~/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/debian.cnf), and no SQL/database dump files. Therefore there is currently no reachable database to run SQL against from this session. No SQL statements have been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide any requested details so I can act:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n  - Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (if any), and database name (optional). Also state the exact SQL question you want answered (e.g., list tables, SELECT rows with a condition, aggregate query).\n  - After you provide connection details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw mysql output; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container (fresh empty DB):\n  - If you want this, confirm and provide a desired root password and any initial database/user to create.\n  - I will install and initialize a server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then run SQL locally as you request.\n\nOption C — Search more extensively for credentials or database dumps on the filesystem:\n  - If you authorize, I will run broader find/grep commands to try to locate hidden .cnf files, SQL dumps, Docker secrets, or other artifacts that might contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: If you post credentials here they will appear in the session; prefer temporary/test credentials if possible.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (for Option A: connection info and the SQL question; for Option B: desired root password and user/db; for Option C: permission to run a deeper search). Once you respond I will either run the chosen shell commands or produce the single SQL statement in the required format.",
