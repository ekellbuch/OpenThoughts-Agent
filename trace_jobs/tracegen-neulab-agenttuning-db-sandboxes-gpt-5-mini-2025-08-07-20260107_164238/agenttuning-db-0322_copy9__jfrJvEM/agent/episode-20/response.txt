The mysql client is available and a root connection without a password works (mysql -uroot). SHOW DATABASES returned only the system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys.

  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact SQL question you want answered. Options you can request include (but are not limited to):\n- List databases (we've already shown system DBs).\n- List tables in a specific database (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM db_name;).\n- Show schema for a table (SHOW CREATE TABLE db_name.table_name;).\n- Run a SELECT with conditions (e.g., SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...;).\n- Count rows, aggregate, or any other query.\n\nOnce you specify the exact question and the target database/table (if applicable), I will:\n1) Explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I will run.\n2) Provide a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw mysql output. I will parse the output and continue until completion.\n\nIf you prefer I can do a discovery step first, for example: \"SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\" to list tables in the mysql system database, or \"SELECT table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','information_schema','performance_schema','sys');\" to find non-system tables (though currently no non-system DBs exist). Tell me which discovery or specific question you want.",
