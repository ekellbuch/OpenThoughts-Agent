  "analysis": "The apt install of mariadb-server was in progress in the last output; package post-install scripts appear to have attempted to start the server and even ran mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" as part of setup. Installation output was truncated, so it's unclear whether the server is fully started and running. Previously we created /var/run/mysqld and set ownership, and the system is root so we can try to verify the server process and attempt a local root connection (no password) using the mysql client. No SQL statements from you have been executed against a target database yet (other than installer probes).",
  "plan": "1) Check for a running mysqld/mariad process (ps) to confirm the server is running.\n2) Check listening sockets to see whether 3306 (or unix socket) is active (ss).\n3) Attempt to connect locally as root and run a simple verification query SELECT VERSION(); to confirm the DB is usable. If that succeeds, we will be ready to run further SQL per your instructions.\n\nCommands will be: ps to find the server process, ss to find listening port/socket, then mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" to test connectivity and return the server version.",
