To proceed I must install a MySQL client in this container, then attempt to connect and list databases. Once I can run SQL against the server, I'll follow your protocol to issue one SQL statement at a time in a markdown code block.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists. 2) Install a MySQL client (install both default-mysql-client and mariadb-client to increase chance one is available). 3) Re-run the mysql client to list databases (SHOW DATABASES;). Based on the output I'll continue with database-specific SQL steps. Expected results: apt-get update will refresh package metadata; apt-get install will install the client binaries; mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" will either list databases or report a connection error (e.g., server not accessible or authentication required), which I'll use to decide next steps.",
