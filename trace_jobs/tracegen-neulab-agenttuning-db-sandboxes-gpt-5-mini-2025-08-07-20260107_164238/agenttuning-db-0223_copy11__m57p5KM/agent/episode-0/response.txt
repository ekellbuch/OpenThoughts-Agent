  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. No MySQL commands have been run yet and no specific question about the database was provided. The environment currently shows only the bash prompt; there is no evidence yet whether a MySQL server is running, whether the MySQL client is installed, or what credentials (if any) to use. Before running SQL against a database I need to: (1) detect whether a MySQL server is running, (2) check for a MySQL client, and (3) look for environment variables or socket files that indicate how to connect. Once I have that info I can craft the exact mysql client invocation or SQL statements you request.",
  "plan": "Run a short set of diagnostic shell commands to discover whether MySQL is available and how to connect. These commands will: (1) show current user and working directory, (2) list files in /app to see if any DB-related artifacts exist, (3) check for a mysql client binary and its version, (4) check whether a mysqld server process is running, (5) list the MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) if present, and (6) print environment variables that contain 'MYSQL' to find credentials. After these diagnostics I will report findings and request the specific SQL question or proceed to connect using detected credentials/sockets.",
