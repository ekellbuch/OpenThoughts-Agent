  "analysis": "I ran an initial diagnostics sweep. The container is root in /app. There are no files in /app. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). No mysqld process is running and /var/run/mysqld does not exist, so there is no local MySQL server. There are no MYSQL-related environment variables. In short: there is currently no local MySQL client or server available and no credentials or connection details provided to connect to a remote MySQL instance.",
  "plan": "Two possible ways forward: (A) If you want me to operate against a remote MySQL server, provide the connection details (host, port, username, password or socket and database) and the SQL question you want answered. I will then craft a single SQL statement in the required format. (B) If you want to work locally from this container, I'll install a MySQL client so we can connect to a server (local or remote). I'll attempt to install the default-mysql-client (and fall back to mariadb-client if needed), then confirm the client is available. After the client is installed, I'll wait for you to provide connection details or a SQL question. The commands below implement option (B): update apt and install a MySQL client, then verify mysql is available.",
