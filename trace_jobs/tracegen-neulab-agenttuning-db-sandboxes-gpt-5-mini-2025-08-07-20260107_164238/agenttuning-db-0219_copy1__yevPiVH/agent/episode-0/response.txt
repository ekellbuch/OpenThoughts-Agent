  "analysis": "We are at a root shell in /app inside a container. No commands have been run yet in this session. The environment currently shows only the shell prompt. To help operate a MySQL database I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, whether the MySQL client is available, and any available credentials or database files. Once I know how to access the database (local socket, TCP, container, credentials), I can run the required SQL statements. Right now nothing has been accomplished; we need to probe the system to locate MySQL and any database files or environment variables that provide connection details.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to find any database files or configuration. 2) Check for running mysqld processes to see if a server is running locally. 3) Check whether mysql client binary is available and its version. 4) Inspect environment variables for MYSQL_*, DB_*, or related credentials. 5) Search the filesystem (current tree) for .sql or .cnf files that might indicate DB location or credentials, and check /etc for MySQL config. These commands will help determine how to connect so I can then prepare the SQL statements you request.",
