  "analysis": "You are connected to a running MariaDB server (10.11.13) in the container and the mysql client works as root with no password. I have already performed basic inspection: SELECT VERSION(); SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; and SELECT User,Host,plugin FROM mysql.user;. Results show only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and three accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql — all@localhost). There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data present. You haven't specified a question or chosen the next SQL operation to run.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", \"Find orders for customer Alice\", etc.), or (B) pick one single exploratory SQL operation for me to run now. When you choose I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL inside a code block). Suggested single operations (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nReply with the specific question or the single operation you want me to run next. I will then output the Action: Operation block containing one SQL statement for you to execute, and after you paste the raw MySQL output I will analyze it and continue.",
