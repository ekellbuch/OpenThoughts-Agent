I have already: verified VERSION(), listed databases (only system DBs: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys), listed tables in the mysql database, and shown accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql — all @ localhost). There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data to inspect. You have not yet specified the question you want answered or which SQL operation to run next.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the question you want answered or choose one single exploratory SQL operation for me to run. Options you can request now (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nWhen you pick an option or state your question, I will (1) explain my approach and thoughts, and (2) produce exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either run another operation or give the final answer in the exact Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...] format.",
