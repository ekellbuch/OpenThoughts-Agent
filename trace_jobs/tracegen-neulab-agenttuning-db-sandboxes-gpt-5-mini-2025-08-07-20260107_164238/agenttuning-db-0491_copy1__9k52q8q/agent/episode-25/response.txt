You previously asked me to inspect the server; I listed system databases and tables in the mysql database and queried mysql.user, which shows three accounts: mariadb.sys, root, and mysql (all@localhost) using mysql_native_password. No non-system/user databases or application data exist yet. To proceed I should check what privileges the root@localhost account has so I know what operations are permitted.",
  "plan": "Run a single SQL statement to show the grants/privileges for root@localhost. This will reveal the effective permissions for the root account and help decide further exploration or answer any privilege-related questions. I will run: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; and inspect the raw MySQL output you return.",
