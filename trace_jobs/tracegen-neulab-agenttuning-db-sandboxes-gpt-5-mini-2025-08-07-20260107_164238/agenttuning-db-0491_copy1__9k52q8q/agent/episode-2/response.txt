  "analysis": "I inspected the container and installed MariaDB. The server is running and the mysql client is available. A quick check returned VERSION() = 10.11.13-MariaDB, and I can connect as root without a password using: mysql -u root -e \"SELECT VERSION();\". There is currently no database query executed other than that version check. At this point the environment is ready to accept SQL statements executed via the mysql client as root.",
  "plan": "I will not run any database queries until you provide the question you want answered. When you provide your question, I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning/thoughts in plain text. 2) Choose either to operate (run a SQL statement) or to answer (final answer). If I operate, I will produce a single SQL statement formatted exactly as you required: it will appear as:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\nI will only produce one SQL statement per operation. You will execute that SQL and provide me with the raw MySQL output; I will parse it, explain my interpretation/thoughts, and then either run another operation or provide the final answer in the exact form you asked (Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...]). If you want me to run a preliminary query now (for example, SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM db; or SELECT ...), tell me which query you want or ask the question you need answered. Note: when I run a SQL operation in the container, I'll execute it with the mysql client as root (mysql -u root -e \"SQL\") so privilege is available.",
