There are system/user-related tables including 'user', 'db', 'tables_priv', 'proxies_priv', etc. No user-created databases were present earlier. To proceed with exploration and to answer typical questions about available database users or privileges, the next logical step is to inspect the 'user' table to see defined accounts and their hosts/plugins.",
