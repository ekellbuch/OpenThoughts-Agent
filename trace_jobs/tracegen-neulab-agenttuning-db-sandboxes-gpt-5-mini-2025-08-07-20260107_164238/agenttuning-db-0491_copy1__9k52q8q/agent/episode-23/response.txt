I have already executed these inspection steps: SELECT VERSION(); SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; and SELECT User,Host,plugin FROM mysql.user;. Results show only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and three accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql — all@localhost). There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data present. No further SQL has been executed because you have not specified the question to answer or which next SQL operation to run.",

Options you can request right now (pick one) or state your own question:\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nWhen you choose one operation or state your question, I will: (1) explain my approach/thoughts, and (2) produce exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). I will wait for your instruction.",
