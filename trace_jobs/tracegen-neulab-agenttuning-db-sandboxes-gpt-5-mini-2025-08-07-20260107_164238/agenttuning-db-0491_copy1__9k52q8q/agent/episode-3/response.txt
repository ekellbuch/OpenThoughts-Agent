I verified connectivity by running a test query (SELECT VERSION()) as root without a password, which returned 10.11.13-MariaDB. No other database queries have been run yet and I don't know your specific question or which database/table(s) to inspect. To proceed I need the question you want answered (for example: list databases, show tables in a particular DB, run a specific SELECT/aggregation, or make schema changes).",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the question to be answered. You have two choices: (A) Ask your question directly (for example: \"Which users have more than 100 points?\" or \"Show me orders from June 2025\") and I will explain my approach and either run a single SQL operation or provide the final answer; or (B) ask me to perform an exploratory query first (I can run one SQL statement per your rules). If you choose exploratory, I recommend one of these initial queries (pick one):\n  - SHOW DATABASES;\n  - SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n  - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\nTell me which you want, or state your question. When I operate I will output exactly the required format (Action: Operation and one SQL code block with a single-line statement). After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it, explain my thoughts, and either issue another operation or give the final answer in the exact form you requested (Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...]).",
