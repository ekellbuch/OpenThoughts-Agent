  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed, running (10.11.13), and the mysql client is available. I connected as root without a password and have already run these inspections: SELECT VERSION(); SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SELECT User,Host,plugin FROM mysql.user; and SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';. Findings: only system databases exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The mysql.user table contains three accounts: mariadb.sys, root, and mysql (all @ localhost) using mysql_native_password. The root@localhost account has full privileges: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO `root`@`localhost` ... WITH GRANT OPTION, plus a PROXY grant. There are no user/application databases or data present yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the specific question you want answered or to pick the next single SQL operation to execute. Options you can request now (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR '<user>'@'<host>';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nIf you want me to run one of these, tell me which. When you ask me to operate, I will: (1) explain my approach/thoughts, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). If you instead want the final answer right now (based on the inspections already done), tell me and I will produce: Action: Answer Final Answer: [...].",
