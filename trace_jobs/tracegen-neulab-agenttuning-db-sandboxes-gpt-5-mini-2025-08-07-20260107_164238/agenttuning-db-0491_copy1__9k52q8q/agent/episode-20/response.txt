I've already run basic inspection: SELECT VERSION(); SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; and SELECT User,Host,plugin FROM mysql.user;. Results show only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and three accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql — all@localhost). There are no non-system/user databases or application data present. You have not specified the question you want answered or which SQL operation to run next.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", \"Find orders for customer Alice\", etc.), or (B) pick one single exploratory SQL operation from the list below. Once you choose, I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL inside a code block). Suggested single operations (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nReply with which operation you want or state your specific question. I will then output the single SQL operation (Action: Operation) for you to execute, and after you return the raw MySQL output I will analyze and continue.",
