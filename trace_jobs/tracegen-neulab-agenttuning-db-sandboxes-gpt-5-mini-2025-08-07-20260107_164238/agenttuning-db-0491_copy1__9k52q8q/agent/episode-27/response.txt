  "analysis": "MariaDB (10.11.13) is installed and running in this container and the mysql client is usable as root without a password. I have already run these inspection queries for you: SELECT VERSION(); SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SELECT User,Host,plugin FROM mysql.user; and SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';. Results show only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The mysql.user table contains three accounts: mariadb.sys, root, and mysql (all@localhost) using mysql_native_password. The root@localhost account has ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* (with GRANT OPTION) and a proxy grant, so we have full administrative rights. There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data present to answer data-specific questions.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further SQL until you tell me what you want to do. Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"List tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", \"Show rows from db.table LIMIT 10\", etc.), or (B) pick one single exploratory SQL operation from the following list so I can run it (I will output exactly one SQL statement per your rules when you choose):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR '<user>'@'<host>';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nWhen you pick one, I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts, and (2) produce a single SQL operation formatted exactly as required (Action: Operation with one single-line SQL statement in a code block). After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll analyze and continue or provide the final answer (Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...]).",
