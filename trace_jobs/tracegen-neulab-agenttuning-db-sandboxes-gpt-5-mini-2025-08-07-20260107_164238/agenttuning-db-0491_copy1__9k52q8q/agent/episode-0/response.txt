  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in the container (/app). No MySQL commands have been run yet and there is no visible database output in the terminal. To answer SQL questions I need a working MySQL client and access to a running MySQL/MariaDB server (socket, port, or credentials). Right now I don't know whether the mysql client is installed, whether a server is running, or whether any credentials are available on the filesystem (for example /etc/mysql/debian.cnf often contains usable local admin credentials).",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary is installed (which mysql and mysql --version). 2) Check whether a mysqld/mariadbd server process is running. 3) Inspect common locations for the server socket and data directory (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql). 4) Try to read /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which may contain credentials for local administration. These steps will let us decide the next SQL operation (connect and query).",
