  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. I verified connectivity by running SELECT VERSION(); and inspected the server: SHOW DATABASES; returned only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). I listed tables in the mysql system database and inspected mysql.user, which shows three accounts (mariadb.sys, root, mysql) all@localhost. There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data to inspect. You have not yet provided the specific question you want answered or selected the next SQL operation to run.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Options:\n- Ask a specific question to answer (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", etc.).\n- Or pick one single exploratory SQL operation for me to run now (I will output the SQL in the required format for you to execute). Suggested single operations you can request: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10; SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; SELECT * FROM mysql.user; \nWhen you choose, I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts in plain text and (2) either produce one SQL statement in the exact Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL inside a code block) for you to execute, or provide the final answer in the exact Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...] format if no further operations are needed.",
