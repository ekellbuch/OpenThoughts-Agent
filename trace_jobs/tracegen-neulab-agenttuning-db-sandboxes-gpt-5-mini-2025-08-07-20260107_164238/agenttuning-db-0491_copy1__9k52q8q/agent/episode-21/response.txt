Results show only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and three accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql — all@localhost). There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data present. You haven't provided a question or requested the next SQL operation.",

Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", \"Find orders for customer Alice\", etc.), or (B) pick one single exploratory SQL operation from the list below. After you choose, I will explain my approach and then output exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). Suggested single operations (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nReply with your question or which single operation you want me to run next.",
