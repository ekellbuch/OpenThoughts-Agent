There are no non-system/user databases or application data present yet. No further SQL has been executed since then because you haven't given a question or chosen the next operation.",

Options you can request now (pick one):\n- Show databases\n- Show tables in a specific database (SHOW TABLES FROM <database>)\n- Describe a table schema (SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>)\n- Count rows in a table (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>)\n- Show sample rows (SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10)\n- Show grants for a user (SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost')\n- Dump mysql.user rows (SELECT * FROM mysql.user)\nWhen you choose, I will (1) explain my reasoning/thoughts, and (2) either output an operation in the exact required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or produce the final answer (Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...]) if no further operations are needed.",
