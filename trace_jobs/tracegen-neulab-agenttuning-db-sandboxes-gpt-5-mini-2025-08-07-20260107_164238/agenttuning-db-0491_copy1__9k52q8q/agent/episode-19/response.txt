There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data to inspect. You have not provided a specific question or chosen the next SQL operation to run.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Options:\n- Ask a specific question to answer (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", etc.).\n- Or pick one single exploratory SQL operation for me to run now. Suggested single operations (pick one):\n  1) SHOW DATABASES;\n  2) SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n  3) SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n  4) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n  5) SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n  6) SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n  7) SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nWhen you choose, I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts and (2) produce exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). I will wait for your instruction.",
