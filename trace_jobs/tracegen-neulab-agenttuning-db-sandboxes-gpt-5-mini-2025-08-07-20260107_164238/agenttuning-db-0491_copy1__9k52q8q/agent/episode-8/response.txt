I have already: verified the server version, listed databases (only system DBs present), listed tables in the mysql database, and showed accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql all@localhost). There are currently no non-system/user databases or application data to inspect. No further SQL has been run since then.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the question you want answered or select one of the exploratory operations below. Provide the question or pick one operation. When you pick an operation I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL inside a code block). Options you can choose now (pick one):\n- List databases (already done): SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Describe a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Show table contents (sample): SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- Show grants for a user: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Show data dictionary rows (e.g., SELECT * FROM mysql.user;)\nTell me which option you want or state your specific question (for example: \"Which users exist?\" or \"Find orders for customer X\"). If you want me to operate now, I will produce the Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement for you to execute. If you want me to wait, I will not run any commands.",
