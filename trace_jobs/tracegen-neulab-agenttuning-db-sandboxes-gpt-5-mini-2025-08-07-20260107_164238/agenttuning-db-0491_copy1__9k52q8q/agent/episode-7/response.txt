  "analysis": "MariaDB server is installed, running, and accessible as root without a password. I inspected system databases and the mysql.user table. Current findings: databases are only the system ones (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and mysql.user contains three accounts: mariadb.sys@localhost, root@localhost, and mysql@localhost, all using mysql_native_password. No user databases or application data are present yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your question or for you to pick the next SQL operation. Possible next operations you can ask me to run (I will run exactly one SQL statement per your rules when you ask):\n- Show all databases (already done).\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Inspect table contents or counts, e.g. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Show grants/privileges for an account: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Describe table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\nTell me which of the above (or a different question) you want answered. If you want me to operate now, tell me which operation to run and I will reply with the required Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement. If you are ready for a final answer based on the current inspection, tell me and I will reply using Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer pattern.",
