When you specify, I will: 1) explain my approach and thoughts, and 2) either run a single SQL statement (formatted per your rules) or provide the final answer. Suggested operations you can request (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nReply with which operation you want or state your question. I will then output the Action: Operation block with one SQL statement as required.",
