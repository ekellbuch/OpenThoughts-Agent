Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", etc.), or (B) pick one exploratory SQL operation from the list below. Once you choose, I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts and (2) produce exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). Suggested operations (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nReply with the question or the operation you want me to run.",
