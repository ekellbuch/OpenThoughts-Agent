  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. I verified connectivity by running SELECT VERSION(); and inspected the server: SHOW DATABASES; returned only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). I listed tables in the mysql system database and inspected mysql.user, which shows three accounts (mariadb.sys, root, mysql) all@localhost. There are no non-system/user databases or application data present. No further SQL has been executed because you have not specified a question or chosen the next operation.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", \"Find orders for customer Alice\", etc.), or (B) pick one single exploratory SQL operation from the list below. Once you choose, I will (1) explain my approach and thoughts, and (2) produce exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). Suggested single operations you can request now (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nAfter you run the SQL I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze it and either run another operation or give the final answer in the exact required format (Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...]).",
