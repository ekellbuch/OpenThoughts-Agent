I have already run these checks: SELECT VERSION(); SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; and SELECT User,Host,plugin FROM mysql.user;. Results show only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and three accounts in mysql.user (mariadb.sys, root, mysql — all@localhost). There are no non-system/user databases or application data present. No further SQL has been executed because you have not specified the question to answer or chosen the next SQL operation to run.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next. Please either: (A) state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Which users exist?\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Count rows in db.table\", \"Find orders for customer Alice\", etc.), or (B) pick one single exploratory SQL operation for me to run now. When you choose, I will (1) explain my approach/thoughts and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL inside a code block). Suggested single operations you can request now (pick one):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- SELECT * FROM mysql.user;\nReply with the specific question or the single operation you want me to run next.",
