  "analysis": "Current state: The container has a working MySQL client (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server or data present in the filesystem (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no credentials file (~/.my.cnf) and no SQL dumps were found. I have finished discovery and client installation. No SQL can be executed yet because there is no reachable server or database dump to operate on.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended)\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregates, ordering, and any limits). If SSL or special flags are required, include them.\n- After you provide these details and the question, I will output exactly one SQL operation in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block). You will run that single SQL statement using the mysql client and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse it, explain results, and, if needed, produce the next single SQL statement to run. Repeat until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container\n- You upload or place a .sql dump (or other DB files) somewhere under /app and tell me the path, and tell me the question you want answered.\n- I will import the dump into a local server (or into a temporary DB I initialize) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information, following the same single-statement-per-step protocol.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here\n- If you allow it, I will install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize it, and create a user/database or import a provided dump. This is slower and may require setting a root password. Tell me if you want this and any preferences for root password or DB name.\n\nNotes about interaction and format (important):\n- Every time I ask to run SQL I will supply exactly one SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw mysql output. I will parse that output and produce the next step.\n- When we are done and I am sure of the final answer, I will output exactly:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n  (only at the end, and only when sure)\n\nPlease pick Option A, B, or C and provide the needed information now so I can proceed. If you choose Option A, include the exact SQL question to answer along with connection details.",
