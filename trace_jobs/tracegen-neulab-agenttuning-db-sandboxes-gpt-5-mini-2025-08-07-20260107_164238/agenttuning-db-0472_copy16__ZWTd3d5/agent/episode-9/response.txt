  "analysis": "Summary of current state: the container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully. There is no local MySQL server or data present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no credential files (~/.my.cnf) were found, and there are no .sql dump files in the filesystem under /app. Discovery and client setup are complete; however, there is no database to query yet. To proceed I need either remote DB connection details, an uploaded SQL dump to import, or explicit permission to install and initialize a local mysql-server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options and provide the necessary information. I list each option and what I will do next once you confirm:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended)\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (what table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits). If SSL or extra flags are required, include those details.\n- After you provide the connection details and the question I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL block with the mysql client and return the raw mysql output. I will parse it and either give the final answer or produce the next single SQL statement to run.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container\n- You upload or place a .sql dump under /app (or tell me its path) and tell me the question.\n- I will import the dump into a local server (or into a temporary DB I initialize) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information, following the one-statement-per-step protocol.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here\n- If you allow it, I will install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize it, set a root password or create a user/database, and optionally import an uploaded dump. This is slower and requires extra steps; if you permit this, tell me the desired root password (or that I should use an auto-generated/empty password) and database name to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run the package install and initialization commands and then proceed to run SQL queries as you request.\n\nImportant interaction rules (reminder):\n- Whenever I ask you to run SQL I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block and prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw mysql output. I will parse that output and continue.\n- When we are done and I am certain of the final answers, I will output exactly:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n  (only at the end, when I am sure)\n\nPlease choose Option A, B, or C and provide the required details (connection info, path to dump, or permission to install with password/db-name). If you choose Option A, also include the exact SQL question you want answered (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations). Once you provide that, I will either (a) emit the first single SQL statement for you to run (if connecting remotely or after import), or (b) begin installing/initializing a local server if you picked Option C.",
