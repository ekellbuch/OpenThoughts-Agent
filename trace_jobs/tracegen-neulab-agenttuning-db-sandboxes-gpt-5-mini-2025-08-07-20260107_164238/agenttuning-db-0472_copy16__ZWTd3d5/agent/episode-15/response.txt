  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server or database files present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no credentials (~/.my.cnf) were found, and no .sql dump files are available in /app. I have completed discovery and client setup; no database is currently available to query. We need one of three inputs from you to proceed: remote DB connection details, a SQL dump to import, or permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to choose one of the following options and provide required details. After you choose, I will proceed with the appropriate steps described.\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact SQL question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limit you want).\n- I will then produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required \"Action: Operation\" block for you to run; you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output for me to parse and continue.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container:\n- Upload/place a .sql dump under /app (tell me the path) and state the question.\n- I will import the dump (install/start a local server if needed) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here:\n- If you permit, tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, the desired root password (or say use empty/auto), and a database name to create (or none).\n- I will install and initialize the server, create the DB/user (or set root), and then run queries or import a provided dump.\n\nPlease reply with A, B, or C and include the necessary details so I can continue. Reminder: when I ask you to run SQL I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\"; you should execute only that SQL block and return the raw mysql output.",
