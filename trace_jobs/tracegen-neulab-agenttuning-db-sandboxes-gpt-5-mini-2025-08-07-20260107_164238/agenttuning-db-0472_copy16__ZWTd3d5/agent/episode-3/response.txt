  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server present (no /var/lib/mysql, no /run/mysqld). The container has an empty /app. I attempted to check listening port 3306 but ss was not found. No configuration or SQL files were found earlier in /app. To proceed I need either: (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) so I can connect with the mysql client and run SQL you request, or (B) a database dump / SQL files in the container to inspect locally. Right now I will search typical locations for MySQL configuration files, .my.cnf credentials, or SQL dumps in the filesystem in case credentials or a dump exist here.",
  "plan": "1) List /etc/mysql to see any config files. 2) Check for a root .my.cnf for stored credentials. 3) Search the filesystem (limited depth) for my.cnf, other .cnf files, and SQL dump files. If I find a socket file or config with credentials, I'll use that to connect. If nothing is found, I'll ask you to provide connection details or an SQL question to answer, at which point I'll run a single SQL statement per your instructions.",
