There is no evidence of a MySQL/MariaDB server running (ps output shows only shell/tmux/sleep processes). No environment variables or files in /app reference MySQL. Nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to a database yet. To run SQL I need either an accessible MySQL server to connect to (host, port, user, password, database) or a local MySQL client/server installed in this container.",
  "plan": "I will (1) determine the OS, (2) detect an available package manager, (3) attempt to install a MySQL client package if possible, and (4) verify the mysql client is available. After that, I will ask you for the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or the SQL question you want answered. If you prefer not to install software here, instead provide the connection string or the database dump/schema so I can craft SQL to run. Commands will: show OS info, detect package manager, run apt-get update and install the default MySQL client (or mysql-client), then re-check for mysql binary and version.",
