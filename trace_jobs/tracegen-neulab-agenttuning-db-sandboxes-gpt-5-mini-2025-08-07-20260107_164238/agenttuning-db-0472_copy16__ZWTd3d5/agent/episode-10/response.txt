  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and verified. There is no local MySQL server or database files present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no saved credentials (~/.my.cnf) were found, and there are no .sql dump files in /app. I have completed environment discovery and client setup, but there is currently no database to query. You have not provided remote connection details, an uploaded dump, or permission to install a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of three options and provide the necessary information. After you choose, I will proceed as follows:\n\n- Option A (connect to remote DB): You provide host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact SQL question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations you want). I will then produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block for you to run with the mysql client; you will run it and return the raw output for me to parse and continue.\n\n- Option B (import a dump): You upload or place a .sql dump in the container and tell me its path and the question. I will import the dump into a local server (or a temporary DB) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information, following the same single-statement-per-step protocol.\n\n- Option C (install local mysql-server): If you allow it, I will install and initialize a local mysql-server (or mariadb-server), set a root password or create a user/database you name, optionally import a provided dump, and then run the SQL you request. This requires package installation and service initialization and will take longer.\n\nPlease reply with your choice (A, B, or C) and provide the required details for that option. Once you do, I will either (a) output the first single SQL statement in the exact format you requested (Action: Operation with one SQL code block), or (b) begin installation/import steps if you chose Option C or B.",
