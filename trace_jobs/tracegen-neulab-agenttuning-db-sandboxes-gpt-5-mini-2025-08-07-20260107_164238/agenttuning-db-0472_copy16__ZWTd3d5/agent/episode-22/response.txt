  "analysis": "The MySQL server had been installed and was previously started manually. You then ran a command that printed a message and the mysqld process was killed by the system (shell reported: [1]+ Killed mysqld ...). That means the server isn't running now. Before running any user SQL it is necessary to (re)start the mysqld daemon and confirm it accepts connections. I should check the MySQL error log for clues about the kill, ensure the runtime directory /run/mysqld exists and is owned by the mysql user, restart mysqld in the background, wait briefly for it to initialize, and then run a simple test query (SELECT VERSION()) and SHOW DATABASES to confirm connectivity. After that I will wait for your SQL question or a path to a dump to import.",
  "plan": "1) Check for any remaining mysqld processes and inspect the MySQL error log to see why it was killed. 2) Ensure /run/mysqld exists and is owned by mysql:mysql. 3) Start mysqld in the background bound to 127.0.0.1 using the existing datadir (/var/lib/mysql) and socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. 4) Wait briefly for startup. 5) Confirm mysqld is running and accept connections by running: SELECT VERSION(); then SHOW DATABASES;. If these succeed, report readiness and wait for your SQL question or a dump path. Each command will be lightweight except starting mysqld which may take a couple of seconds.",
