  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server or data in /app, no .my.cnf credentials, and no SQL dump files found. I have completed discovery and client setup but no database is available to query yet. You have not provided a remote DB connection or uploaded a dump, nor have you explicitly allowed installation of a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these paths. For each path I describe the exact next actions I will take once you confirm:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended)\n- You provide: host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the SQL question (what you want returned).\n- After you provide these, I will craft exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block). You will run that SQL statement with the mysql client and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse the output, explain results, and if needed produce the next single SQL statement to run.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container\n- You upload or place a .sql dump (or other DB files) somewhere under /app (tell me the path).\n- I will import the dump into a local MySQL server (or into a temporary server I set up) and then run SQL to answer your question. If you choose this, tell me the path to the dump and the question.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container\n- If you allow it, I will install mysql-server (or mariadb-server) and initialize it, then create a user/database or set a temporary root password. This can be slower and may require additional configuration. If you confirm, I will run package installation, initialize the service, and then create a database or import a provided dump. After that I will run SQL per your question.\n\nNotes about interaction and SQL execution protocol:\n- When you want me to run SQL, I will output a single SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation then one SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block and nothing else SQL-related). You will execute only the first SQL code block I produce and return the raw mysql output to me. I will parse and respond.\n- If you give remote credentials I will not store them; I will only use them to form queries you asked for.\n\nPlease choose Option A, B, or C and provide the required details (connection info, dump path, or permission to install). If you choose Option A, include the exact question (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits).",
