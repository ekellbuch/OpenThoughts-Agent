  "analysis": "The container is ready with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server or database files present (no /var/lib/mysql, no /run/mysqld), no credentials (~/.my.cnf) and no .sql dump files were found under /app. All environment discovery and client setup steps are complete. No SQL can be executed until you provide either remote DB credentials, a database dump to import, or permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you choose one of these options and provide the required details:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits).\n- After you provide these, I will produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block). You will run that SQL with the mysql client and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and continue iterating until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container:\n- Upload/place a .sql dump under /app (tell me the path) and state the question.\n- I will import the dump into a local server or temporary DB and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information, following the single-statement-per-step protocol.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here:\n- If you allow it, tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, provide a desired root password (or say use empty/auto), and a database name to create (or none).\n- I will install and initialize the server, create the DB/user or import a provided dump, then run SQL to answer your question.\n\nImportant: When I ask you to run SQL I will output exactly one SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output. When finished and certain of the answer, I will output exactly:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with your choice (A, B, or C) and the required details (connection info, dump path, or permission + passwords).",
