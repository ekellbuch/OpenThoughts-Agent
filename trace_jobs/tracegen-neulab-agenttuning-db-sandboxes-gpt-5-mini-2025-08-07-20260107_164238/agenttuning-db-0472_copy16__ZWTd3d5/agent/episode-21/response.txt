When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain the approach and the exact SQL I will run. 2) If you choose to operate, I will output one SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I produce and return the raw mysql output to me. I will parse the output and either provide the final answer or produce the next single SQL statement to run. If you want me to import a dump first, tell me the path under /app and the target database name and I will import it and then run queries as requested.",
