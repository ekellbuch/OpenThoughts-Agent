  "analysis": "The shell prompt is at root@134f0e576ab7:/app with no prior commands shown. There's no information about a running MySQL server, available client, or database files yet. To answer database questions or run SQL I need to discover whether a MySQL client is available, whether a MySQL server is running (and how to connect), and whether there are any SQL or configuration files in the repository that contain credentials or schema. Nothing has been accomplished yet; discovery is required.",
  "plan": "I'll inspect the filesystem and environment to find MySQL client/server, running processes, configuration or SQL files and any environment variables that might contain credentials. Specifically I'll: 1) list files in /app to see project files. 2) list running processes to see if mysqld is running. 3) check for a mysql client binary and its version. 4) search environment variables for MYSQL related creds. 5) search the repo for .sql files or config files (like .env, docker-compose.yml, my.cnf) that might contain connection info. Each command is lightweight; I'll run them one by one to gather info needed to connect or to craft the SQL queries you ask for.",
