I verified connectivity by running: /usr/bin/mysql -u root -e \"SELECT VERSION()\" which returned version 8.0.44. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so root currently has an empty password and local connections as root succeed. The default system databases exist: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or SQL dumps have been imported yet.",

Options now:\n- If you provide a SQL question about the current server data, tell me the exact request (which database/table/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limit). I will produce one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation / markdown SQL code block format for you to run; you will execute it and return the raw mysql output, which I will parse and iterate on.\n- If you want to import a dump, upload/place a .sql file under /app (tell me the path) and I will import it into a new database and then run queries to answer your question.\n- If you want me to create a new database/table and insert sample data, tell me the schema and data and I will proceed.\n\nI will not run further SQL until you specify the question or provide a dump. When you give the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (inside the Action: Operation block as you required) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
