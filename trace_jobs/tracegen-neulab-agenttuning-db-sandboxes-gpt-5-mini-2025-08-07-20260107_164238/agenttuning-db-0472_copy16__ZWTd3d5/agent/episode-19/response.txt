I started mysqld manually and verified connectivity: /usr/bin/mysql -u root -e \"SELECT VERSION()\" returned version 8.0.44. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the root account has an empty password and can connect locally without a password. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and log (/var/log/mysql/error.log) exist. No user databases or application data were provided yet.",

After that, I will wait for you to provide the SQL question you want answered or any dump to import. If you want, I can create a database, import a dump, or run any SQL you instruct. If you ask me to run SQL, remember I will output a single SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block (one SQL code block) and you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output to me.",
