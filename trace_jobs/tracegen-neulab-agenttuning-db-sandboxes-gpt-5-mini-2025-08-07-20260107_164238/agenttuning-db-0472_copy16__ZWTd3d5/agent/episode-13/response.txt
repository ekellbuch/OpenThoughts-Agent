  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server or database data present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no saved credentials (~/.my.cnf) were found, and no .sql dump files exist under /app. I have completed discovery and client setup; there is currently no database to query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options so I can proceed: \n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limit you want). Once provided I will produce a single SQL statement (Action: Operation with one SQL code block) for you to run and return the raw mysql output for me to parse and iterate.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container: upload or place a .sql dump under /app and tell me its path and the question. I will import it (installing a local server if needed) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here: if you permit, tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, the desired root password (or say empty/auto), and a database name to create. I will install, initialize, create/import as requested, and then produce the SQL to run.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option (A, B, or C) and provide the required details for that option. After you provide them I will either (a) output the first single SQL statement in the exact format you required for you to run, or (b) begin installation/import steps if you selected Option C or B.",
