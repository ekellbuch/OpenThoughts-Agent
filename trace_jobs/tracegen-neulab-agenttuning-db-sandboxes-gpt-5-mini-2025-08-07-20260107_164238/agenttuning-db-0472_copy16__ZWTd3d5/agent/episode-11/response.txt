  "analysis": "You are in a container running Ubuntu 24.04. The MySQL client was installed successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server or database files present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no credentials file (~/.my.cnf) was found, and no .sql dump files were located under /app. All environment discovery and client setup steps have been completed. No SQL can be executed until you either provide remote DB credentials, upload a SQL dump to the container, or permit a local MySQL server installation and initialization.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options. After you choose, I will perform the specific actions below and produce the single-SQL-statement output format you required when it's time to run queries.\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limit you want).\n- Next steps I will take once you provide details: (1) craft exactly one SQL statement inside the required \"Action: Operation\" block (a single SQL code block); (2) you will run that SQL and return the raw mysql output; (3) I will parse the result and either give the final answer or produce the next single SQL statement.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container:\n- You place/upload a .sql dump (or other DB files) under /app and tell me the path and the question.\n- Next steps I will take once you provide the dump path: (1) install and start a local mysql-server if needed or create a temporary database to import into; (2) import the dump; (3) craft exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run to extract the requested info; (4) iterate as needed.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here:\n- If you allow this, tell me whether to use mysql-server or mariadb-server, the desired root password (or say generate/use empty), and a database name to create (or say none).\n- Next steps I will take once you permit: (1) install mysql-server (or mariadb), initialize/start the service, (2) create the requested database/user (or set root password), (3) run queries or import a provided dump, and (4) produce SQL in the Action: Operation single-statement format for you to run and return output for me to parse.\n\nImportant interaction rules reminder:\n- Every time I ask you to run SQL I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block and prefixed by the line \"Action: Operation\". You must execute only that first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output. I will parse it and continue.\n- When we are done and I am sure of the final answer, I will output exactly:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n  and nothing else for the final answer step.\n\nPlease choose Option A, B, or C and provide the necessary details (connection info, dump path, or permission and passwords).",
