  "analysis": "The container is ready with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server or database files present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist), no credentials (~/.my.cnf) were found, and no .sql dumps were located under /app. I have completed environment discovery and client installation. No SQL can be executed until you either (A) provide remote DB connection details, (B) upload a SQL dump into the container, or (C) permit me to install and initialize a local MySQL server here. You have not yet chosen one of those options.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details. Specifically:\n- Option A (connect to remote DB): provide host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limit you want). Once provided, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to run; you will run it and return the raw mysql output.\n- Option B (import a dump): upload or place a .sql dump under /app and tell me its path and the question. I will import it (installing a local server if necessary) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested info.\n- Option C (install local server): if you permit, tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server and provide a root password (or say use empty/auto) and optionally a database name to create. I will then install, initialize, and proceed to import/run queries.\n\nIf you are unsure, reply with your preferred option. I will not take further actions until you confirm which path to follow. To prompt you, I will print a short instruction to the terminal.",
