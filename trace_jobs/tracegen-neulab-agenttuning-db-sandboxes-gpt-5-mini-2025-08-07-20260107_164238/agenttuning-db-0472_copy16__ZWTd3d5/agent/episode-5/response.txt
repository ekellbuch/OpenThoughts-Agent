  "analysis": "The container now has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or present (/var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist). No credentials (.my.cnf) or SQL dump files were found in the filesystem. Nothing remains to query locally until a database server or a dump is provided. I have completed discovery and set up the client; next steps require you to provide connection details or a database dump or permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and then act accordingly:\n- Option A (preferred): Provide remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the SQL question you want answered. Once you provide those, I will craft a single SQL statement (in the exact format you requested) to run. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse the output and continue iterating until done.\n- Option B: Upload or place a SQL dump (.sql) or database files into this container (or tell me where they are). I will import or inspect them with the mysql client and run queries to answer your question.\n- Option C: Allow me to install and initialize a local mysql-server here. I can install and start a server, create or import a database, then run queries — note this is slower and may require setting a root password or using temporary credentials.\n\nIf you choose Option A, please provide: host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (what results or aggregation you need). If the server requires SSL or special flags, include those details. After you provide connection info and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required markdown format for you to execute. Remember: each operation step I output will contain only one SQL statement inside a code block, and you will run only the first SQL block and return its output.",
