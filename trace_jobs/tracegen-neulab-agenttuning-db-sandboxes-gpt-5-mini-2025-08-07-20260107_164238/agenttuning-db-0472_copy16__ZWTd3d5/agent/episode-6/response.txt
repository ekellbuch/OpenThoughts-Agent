  "analysis": "The MySQL client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or data present in /app, and no credentials (.my.cnf) or SQL dumps were found. I have completed discovery and environment setup for a client-only workflow. To run SQL and answer your question, I need either a reachable MySQL server (remote host + credentials), a database dump placed in the container, or permission to install and initialize a local mysql-server instance.",
  "plan": "I will not run any more commands until you choose one of these options: \n\n- Option A (connect to remote server): Provide host, port (default 3306), username, password, and database name, and the exact question you want answered (what table, columns, filters, aggregation, ordering, limits). Once you provide these, I will produce a single SQL statement (in the exact markdown format you required, preceded by Action: Operation) for you to execute with the mysql client. You will run only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output, which I will parse and continue iterating until the final answer is ready.\n\n- Option B (import a dump): Upload or place a .sql dump in the container (or tell me its path). I will import it into a local server or create a temporary database and then run SQL to answer your question.\n\n- Option C (install local server): Allow me to install and initialize a local mysql-server in this container. I will install, start the server, set up credentials, create/import databases as needed, and then run SQL to answer your question. This is slower and requires additional steps.\n\nPlease specify which option you want and provide the necessary information (credentials, dump path, or permission to install). After you provide that, I will either produce the first single SQL statement to run (Action: Operation block) or begin installing/ importing as requested.",
