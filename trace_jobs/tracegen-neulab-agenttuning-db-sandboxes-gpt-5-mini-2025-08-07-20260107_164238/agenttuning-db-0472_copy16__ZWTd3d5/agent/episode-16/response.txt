  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and verified (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server or database files present (no /var/lib/mysql, no /run/mysqld), no credentials file (~/.my.cnf) and no .sql dumps were found under /app. I have completed environment discovery and set up the client; there is currently no database to query. You have not yet provided remote connection details, uploaded a dump, or given permission to install a local MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options so I can proceed: \n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limit you want). Once provided, I will produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run with the mysql client. You will run only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iterating until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container: upload/place a .sql dump under /app and tell me its path plus the question. I will import it (installing/initializing a local server if needed) and then produce the single SQL statement(s) to extract the requested information, following the single-statement-per-step protocol.\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here: if you permit it, tell me whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, provide the desired root password (or say empty/auto), and a database name to create (or none). I will install, initialize, create the DB/user (or set root), and then run queries or import a provided dump. This path is slower and requires additional steps.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option (A, B, or C) and provide the required details for that option. After you provide the details I will either (a) output the first single SQL statement in the exact format you requested for you to run, or (b) begin installation/import steps if you selected Option C or B.",
