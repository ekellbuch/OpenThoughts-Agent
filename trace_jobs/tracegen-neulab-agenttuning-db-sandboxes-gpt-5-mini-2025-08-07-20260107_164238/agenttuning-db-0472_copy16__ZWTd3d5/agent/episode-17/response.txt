  "analysis": "So far the container has only the MySQL client installed and no server or database data. /app is empty, /var/lib/mysql and /run/mysqld do not exist, and no credentials or SQL dumps were found. To be able to run SQL here we need a running MySQL server. The user hasn't provided remote DB credentials or an uploaded dump, so the next reasonable step is to install and start a local MySQL server in the container so we can create/import data and run queries locally.",
  "plan": "Install mysql-server, ensure the runtime directory exists and is owned by the mysql user, initialize the data directory (insecure initialization so root has no password), start mysqld in the background bound to 127.0.0.1, then test a simple SELECT VERSION() query to confirm the server is up. If the server starts successfully, we'll be able to create databases, import dumps, or run queries per your requests. Each command is chosen to either install, prepare, initialize, start, or verify the server.",
