At this point I can use the mysql client to connect to a remote or local MySQL server if you provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or provide a database dump/schema to inspect. Before asking for credentials, it's useful to confirm whether there is a local MySQL server or socket present and whether anything is listening on port 3306.",
  "plan": "1) Check for local MySQL server files (common locations). 2) Check if any process is listening on port 3306. 3) If a server is present, attempt to show the socket location so we can connect; otherwise I will ask you for the database connection details or a dump. I will run the checks with the mysql client not attempting to connect yet.",
