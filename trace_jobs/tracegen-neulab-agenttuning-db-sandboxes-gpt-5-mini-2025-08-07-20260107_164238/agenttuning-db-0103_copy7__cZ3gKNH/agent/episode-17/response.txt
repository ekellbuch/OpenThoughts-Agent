  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql v8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I inspected standard config locations (/etc/mysql, /etc/mysql/conf.d, /root) and found no credentials (.my.cnf) or usable debian-sys-maint credentials. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or the specific database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials. Please provide one of the following and the exact SQL question you want answered:\n\n1) Remote DB credentials: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and optionally database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n2) Local socket credentials: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password, or indicate socket/peer auth.\n\n3) Path to a credentials/config file you want me to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it and extract connection details.\n\n4) If you prefer, authorize me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container; if so, confirm and provide desired DB name and credentials to create.\n\nAlso state the exact question to answer (examples: \"list all tables in database X\", \"COUNT rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", or \"select top 5 rows from orders where created_at > '2025-01-01'\" ).\n\nOnce you provide connection details and the precise question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement and present it exactly as Action: Operation with one SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse the output and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until I produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format.",
