  "analysis": "We have a container with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44) but there is no local MySQL server running and no credentials were found in common locations. I inspected /etc/mysql and conf.d files; none contained usable credentials. No SQL has been run because there is no reachable database and you have not yet provided connection details or a specific question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "I need connection information or permission to search additional files so I can run SQL. Please provide one of the following:\n\n- Remote DB credentials: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and (optionally) database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n- Local socket credentials: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password (or indicate if auth uses socket/peer). Example: socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock user=root password=secret\n\n- Path to a credentials/config file to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read that file to obtain connection info.\n\nAlso tell me the exact question you want answered (for example: list tables in database X, show the schema for table Y, count rows in table Z, return rows matching condition W, etc.).\n\nHow I'll proceed once you provide details:\n1) If credentials are provided, I will prepare a single SQL statement (one-line) and label it exactly as Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing the SQL. Per your rules, you will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output.  \n2) I will parse the output you return, then prepare the next single SQL statement as needed, iterating until we can produce the final result.  \n3) When finished, I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer: [ ... ] exactly as you required.\n\nIf you want me to try more automatic discovery instead (e.g., searching other paths or scanning for open MySQL ports), tell me which action to take and I will run the appropriate shell commands. I will not execute any SQL until I have connection details and the question.",
