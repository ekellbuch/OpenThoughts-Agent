  "analysis": "You haven't provided database connection details or the SQL question yet. The environment has the MySQL client installed, but there is no local server detected. To proceed I should look for any existing credential/config files (.my.cnf, .cnf files, .env, docker-compose, etc.) that might contain connection info, and inspect the root home and common project locations. Nothing has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "1) Check root's home for a .my.cnf or other credential files. 2) Search common locations (/etc, /root, /app, /home, /var) for .cnf files, .env files, docker-compose.yml, or other files that might contain MySQL connection info. 3) If I find credentials, I'll use them to prepare the first single-line SQL statement in the required Action/Operation format. If nothing is found, I'll ask you to provide host, port, user, password, and the exact question to answer.\n\nCommands will list /root, show any root .my.cnf, then run targeted finds for config and environment files. These are diagnostic and quick; no SQL will be run yet.",
