  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql v8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process), and I found no credentials in common locations (/root/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql conf files contained no credentials). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or the specific database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials. Please provide one of the following and the exact question you want answered:\n\n1) Remote DB credentials: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and optionally the database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n2) Local socket credentials: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password (or indicate that socket/peer auth should be used).\n\n3) Path to a credentials/config file you want me to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). If you give a path I will read it and extract connection details.\n\nAlso state the exact database question (for example: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", \"select top 5 rows from table T where ...\").\n\nOnce you provide the connection details and the precise question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement wrapped exactly as:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\nYou will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate with further single SQL statements until I can produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.",
