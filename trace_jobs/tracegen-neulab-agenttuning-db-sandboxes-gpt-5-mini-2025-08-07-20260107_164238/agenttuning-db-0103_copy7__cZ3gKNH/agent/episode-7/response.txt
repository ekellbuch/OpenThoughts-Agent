  "analysis": "I inspected the container: the MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). I looked for configuration and credential files: /etc/mysql exists with conf.d (mysqldump.cnf and mysql.cnf) and a my.cnf.fallback, but none of these contains credentials. There is no /root/.my.cnf and my searches across /etc, /root, /app, /home, and /var did not reveal any files containing MySQL credentials or environment variables. Therefore there is no reachable server or discovered credentials in this environment yet.",
  "plan": "I need connection details to proceed and run SQL. Please provide one of the following:\n- Remote connection info: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, and (optionally) database name; OR\n- Local socket info and credentials (socket path, username, password); OR\n- If a credentials file exists elsewhere that I should inspect, tell me its path and I will read it.\n\nAlso tell me the exact question you want answered (for example: list tables in database X, count rows in table Y, find rows matching condition Z, etc.).\n\nOnce you provide connection details and the SQL question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement wrapped as Action: Operation with a single SQL code block (marked in Markdown) per your rules. You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will then parse it and iterate as needed until I can produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format you specified.",
