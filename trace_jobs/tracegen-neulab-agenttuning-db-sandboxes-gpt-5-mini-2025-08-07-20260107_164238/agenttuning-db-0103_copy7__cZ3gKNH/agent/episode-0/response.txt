  "analysis": "The terminal is a fresh shell at /app with no prior commands executed in this session (the prompt shows root@3dd724162b22:/app#). There is no information yet about any MySQL server, client, credentials, or database files. To answer future SQL questions I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running locally (or accessible), locate config or credential files (.my.cnf, environment variables, docker-compose, etc.), and verify a client is available to run SQL. Nothing has been accomplished yet; we must probe the environment to find the MySQL server and credentials before issuing any SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I will run a short set of diagnostic shell commands to discover the MySQL environment and where to connect:\n- Print the current working directory and list files in /app to see project files that may contain DB info.\n- List /etc/mysql to see server config presence.\n- Check for any running mysqld process.\n- List listening TCP ports to see if port 3306 is open (MySQL default).\n- Print environment variables that mention mysql to find credentials or connection info.\n- Search the filesystem (excluding /proc and /sys) for my.cnf to locate config files.\nThese commands will help me decide the next precise action (connect with mysql client, or inspect project config). I will not execute any SQL yet — after we find a server and credentials, I'll prepare a single SQL statement per your execution rules.",
