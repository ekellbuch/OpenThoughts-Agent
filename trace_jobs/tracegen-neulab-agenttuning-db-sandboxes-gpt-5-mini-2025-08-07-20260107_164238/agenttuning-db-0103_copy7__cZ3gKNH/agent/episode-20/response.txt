  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). I inspected common configuration/credential locations (/etc/mysql, /etc/mysql/conf.d, /root) and found no usable credentials (.my.cnf not present and /etc/debian.cnf had no credentials). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not supplied connection details or specified the database question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I either have connection credentials to an existing server or permission to install and start a local server. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote DB credentials (recommended):\n  - Supply host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password, and optionally database name, and state the exact question you want answered (examples: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"select top 5 rows from orders where ...\").\n  - After you provide these, I will prepare one SQL statement and present it as: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block (one-line SQL). You will run that block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption 2 — Provide path to a credentials/config file in the container:\n  - Give an absolute path to a file (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it to extract credentials and then proceed as in Option 1.\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install and start a local DB server (invasive):\n  - Confirm you allow installation and starting of a DB server in this container. Indicate whether to install mysql-server or mariadb-server, provide the root password (or tell me to auto-generate/use an unsecured local root for testing), and any initial DB/user to create (name, user, password). If authorized, I will:\n      1) Install the chosen server package.\n      2) Initialize/start the server.\n      3) Create the requested database and user.\n      4) Then run SQL queries to answer your question.\n  - If you choose this, I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nOption 4 — Ask me to continue discovery (non-invasive):\n  - I can search additional filesystem paths or perform a network scan for reachable MySQL servers, but I will need you to authorize network scans and/or installation of network tools (nmap/net-tools). If you authorize, specify which hosts/ranges to scan.\n\nNext steps depending on your choice:\n- If you provide credentials and the exact question, I will prepare the single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block) for you to execute.\n- If you permit installing a local server, I will propose the exact apt commands to install and configure it and then proceed to create the DB/user and run queries.\n- If you want more discovery, tell me which paths or network ranges to probe and I will run targeted commands.\n\nI will wait for you to pick an option and provide the necessary details. I will not run any SQL or install software until you confirm which path to take.",
