  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql v8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server detected (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I inspected /etc/mysql and conf.d; none of the files contained credentials. I also checked /root for ~/.my.cnf and searched common locations for env files or docker-compose files — no database credentials or connection info were found. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server or credentials available.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials. Please provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n- Remote DB credentials: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password, and (optionally) database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n- Local socket credentials: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password (or note if socket/peer authentication should be used).\n\n- Or the path to a credentials file you want me to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). If you supply a file path I will read it and extract connection details.\n\nAlso tell me the exact database question you want answered (for example: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", \"select top 5 rows from table T where ...\", etc.).\n\nOnce you provide connection details and the precise question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement and label it exactly as Action: Operation with a single SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until I can produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format you required.",
