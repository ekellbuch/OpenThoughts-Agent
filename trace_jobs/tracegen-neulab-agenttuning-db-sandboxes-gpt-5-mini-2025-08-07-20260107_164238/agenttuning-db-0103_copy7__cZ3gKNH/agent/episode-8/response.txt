  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I inspected common config files (/etc/mysql/*) and there are no credentials or socket settings that would allow connecting. I also checked for a root ~/.my.cnf and common environment variables — none were found. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and no credentials have been provided.",
  "plan": "I need connection details or permission to search further for credentials before I can execute SQL. You can provide either:\n- Remote connection info: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, and optional database name; OR\n- Local socket path and credentials; OR\n- The path to a credentials file I should inspect (for example a .my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). Also tell me the exact question you want answered (e.g., list tables in database X, count rows in table Y, return rows matching condition Z).\n\nOnce you provide the connection details and the precise question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement wrapped as Action: Operation (SQL in a single Markdown code block) per your rules. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse the output and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until I can produce the final answer. If you want me to attempt additional automatic discovery (search more paths or inspect particular files), tell me which paths to check and I will run those diagnostics.",
