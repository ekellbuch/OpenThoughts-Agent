  "analysis": "Summary of current state:\n- This container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44).  \n- There is no local MySQL server running or detectable: no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket and no mysqld process.  \n- I inspected common configuration files (/etc/mysql/* and /root) and found no credentials or credential files (~/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf were not present or had no credentials).  \n- No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection information or the database question to answer.\n\nWhat has been accomplished:\n- Installed and verified the mysql client.\n- Searched for MySQL server, sockets, and credential/config files in common locations.\n\nWhat still needs to be done:\n- Obtain a reachable MySQL server and credentials (or a credentials file) to connect to so I can run SQL.  \n- Clarify the exact DB question you want answered so I can prepare the single-line SQL statement in the required format.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until I have a reachable server and the precise question. Please choose one of these options and provide details:\n\n1) Provide remote database connection details (recommended):\n   - host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, password, and optionally database name.  \n   - Also state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"list all tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"select the 5 most recent rows from table orders\", etc.).\n\n2) If the DB is local and uses a socket or there is a credentials file on the filesystem, provide:\n   - socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) and credentials OR\n   - path to a credentials/config file (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf) and I will read it and extract credentials.\n\n3) If you want me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container, tell me so and confirm that's acceptable; I can install mariadb-server or mysql-server and create users/databases as needed (this requires more invasive steps).\n\nOnce you provide the connection details and the exact SQL question, I will:  \n- Prepare a single-line SQL statement and present it as Action: Operation with a single SQL code block in Markdown (per your rules).  \n- You will execute only that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.  \n- I will parse the output, iterate with further single SQL statements as needed, and finally produce Action: Answer with Final Answer: [ ... ] when the result is complete.\n\nIf you want me to continue discovery automatically instead (for example install net-tools and run netstat or install and start a local server), tell me which discovery/installation action you want and I will run the necessary shell commands.",
