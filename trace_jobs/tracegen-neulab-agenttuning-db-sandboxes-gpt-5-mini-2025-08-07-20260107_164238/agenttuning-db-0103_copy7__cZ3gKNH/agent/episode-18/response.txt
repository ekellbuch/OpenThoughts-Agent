  "analysis": "You are in a container that now has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). I have inspected common places for a server and credentials: there is no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no /root/.my.cnf, and /etc/mysql conf files do not contain credentials. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable MySQL server or credentials available in this environment.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you provide connection information or allow me to set up a local server. Please choose one of the following actions and supply the requested details:\n\n1) Provide remote DB connection details (recommended):\n   - host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password, and optionally database name. Also tell me the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"select top 5 rows from orders\", etc.).\n   - Once you provide these, I will produce one SQL statement (single-line) wrapped as Action: Operation with a single SQL code block (per your rules) for you to run; you'll return the raw MySQL output and I'll iterate.\n\n2) Provide a credentials/config file path for me to inspect (e.g., /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it and extract credentials if present, then proceed as in (1).\n\n3) Allow me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container. If you permit, specify which server (mysql-server or mariadb-server), desired root password (or tell me to configure authless root for local testing), and any initial database or user to create. If you authorize this, I will install, start the server, create the requested DB/user, and then run SQL. Note: this is invasive and will modify the container.\n\n4) If you want me to perform additional automatic discovery (e.g., search more filesystem paths or scan the network for open MySQL ports), say so and specify limits. I can run targeted commands to try to find an accessible server.\n\nUntil you provide one of the above or the specific question + connection details, I will not execute any SQL.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details. After you do, I will prepare the first Action: Operation SQL statement (one-line, in a single Markdown SQL block) as required and wait for you to execute it and return the raw MySQL output.",
