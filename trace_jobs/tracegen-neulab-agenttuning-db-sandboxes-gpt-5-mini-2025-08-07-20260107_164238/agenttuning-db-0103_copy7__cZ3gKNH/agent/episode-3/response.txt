  "plan": "1) Confirm presence of the MySQL client binary and any client config file in /etc/mysql. 2) Ask you for the database connection details (host, port or socket, user, password). 3) Once you provide connection information (or if a server is local), I will prepare a single-line SQL statement in the required Markdown format for you to execute; you will run it and return the raw MySQL output, and we will iterate until the question is answered.\n\nCommands I will run now: list /etc/mysql to see any config file and display the my.cnf fallback; show the top of mysql --help to confirm client usage and options so you know how to pass connection parameters.",
