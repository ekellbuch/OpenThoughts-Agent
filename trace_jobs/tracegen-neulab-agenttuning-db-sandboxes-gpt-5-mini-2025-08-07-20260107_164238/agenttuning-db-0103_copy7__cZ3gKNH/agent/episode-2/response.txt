The system has apt available, so the next step is to install a MySQL/MariaDB client so we can run SQL against a server (local or remote). Nothing has been accomplished toward executing SQL yet.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client package using apt so we can run mysql commands. Then verify the client is installed by checking mysql --version and which mysql. After that I will ask you for the database connection details (host, port, user, password, or socket) or, if you already have a question about data in a database accessible from this environment, I'll prepare the first single-line SQL statement per your execution rules.",
