  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). I inspected common configuration/credential locations (/etc/mysql, /etc/mysql/conf.d, /root) and found no usable credentials (.my.cnf not present, /etc/debian.cnf empty of credentials). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or asked a concrete database question.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until there is a reachable MySQL server and credentials or until you authorize me to set up a server locally. Please choose one of the following and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote (or existing) DB (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit to use 3306), username, password, and optionally the database name.\n- Also state the exact question you want answered (examples: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", \"select top 5 rows from orders where ...\").\n- After you provide these, I will create exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement (in a single Markdown SQL code block) for you to run. You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw mysql output; I will parse it and iterate as needed.\n\nOption B — Inspect a credentials/config file on the filesystem:\n- Provide the absolute path to a file to inspect (e.g., /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it to extract credentials and then proceed as in Option A.\n\nOption C — Set up a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (invasive):\n- Confirm you permit installation and starting of a DB server. Tell me which server you prefer (mysql-server or mariadb-server), the root password to set (or indicate you accept an auto-generated/blank one for testing), and any initial DB/user to create (name, user, password).\n- If you authorize this, I will: install the package(s), initialize/start the server, create the requested database/user, and then run SQL queries to answer your question. I will list the exact commands I will run before executing them.\n\nOption D — Automatic discovery/network scan (less preferred):\n- If you want me to try to find a reachable MySQL server on the network, tell me acceptable network ranges/hosts to probe (I will only scan hosts you permit). I can install net-tools/ss or use nmap to look for open 3306 ports, but this requires installation and network permission.\n\nOnce you pick one option and provide details (and the exact DB question), I will proceed. If you choose a remote/local connection, I will prepare and present the next step as a single Action: Operation with one SQL statement in a single markdown SQL code block (per your rules).",
