To answer future SQL questions I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running locally (or accessible), locate config or credential files (.my.cnf, environment variables, docker-compose, etc.), and verify a client is available to run SQL. Nothing has been accomplished yet; we must probe the environment to find the MySQL server and credentials before issuing any SQL statements.\",\n  \"plan\": \"I will run a short set of diagnostic shell commands to discover the MySQL environment and where to connect:\\n- Print the current working directory and list files in /app to see project files that may contain DB info.\\n- List /etc/mysql to see server config presence.\\n- Check for any running mysqld process.\\n- List listening TCP ports to see if port 3306 is open (MySQL default).\\n- Print environment variables that mention mysql to find credentials or connection info.\\n- Search the filesystem (excluding /proc and /sys) for my.cnf to locate config files.\\nThese commands will help me decide the next precise action (connect with mysql client, or inspect project config). I will not execute any SQL yet \u2014 after we find a server and credentials, I'll prepare a single SQL statement per your execution rules.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"pwd\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la /etc/mysql || true\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.5\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ps aux | grep -i mysqld | grep -v grep || true\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.5\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ss -ltnp | sed -n '1,200p' || netstat -tlnp | sed -n '1,200p' || true\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.5\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"env | grep -i mysql || true\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"find / -path /proc -prune -o -path /sys -prune -o -name my.cnf -print 2>/dev/null | sed -n '1,200p'\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 2.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": false\n}"
