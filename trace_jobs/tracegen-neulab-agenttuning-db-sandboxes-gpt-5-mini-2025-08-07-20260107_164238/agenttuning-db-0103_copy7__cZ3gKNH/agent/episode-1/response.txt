  "analysis": "From the previous commands I see this container has no MySQL server running and no MySQL configuration files present. The /app directory is empty, /etc/mysql doesn't exist, no mysqld process is running, ss/netstat isn't available, and find didn't locate my.cnf. At this point there is neither a local server nor client discovered. We need to determine whether a MySQL client is available and whether there are any sockets or data directories that indicate an installed server. If neither exists, we may need to install a client or connect to a remote server (credentials required).",
  "plan": "Next I will check for MySQL/MariaDB client binaries and common MySQL runtime directories/sockets so we know how to proceed:\n- which mysql and mysql --version to see if a client is present and its version.\n- which mariadb and mariadb --version as an alternative client.\n- which mysqladmin to see if server admin tool exists.\n- List /var/run/mysqld and /var/lib/mysql to check for sockets or data dir indicating a server is installed locally.\n- Check for apt-get to know if we can install a client if missing.\nEach command is short and diagnostic; based on their outputs I'll decide whether to install a client, attempt a local socket connection, or ask you for remote connection credentials.",
