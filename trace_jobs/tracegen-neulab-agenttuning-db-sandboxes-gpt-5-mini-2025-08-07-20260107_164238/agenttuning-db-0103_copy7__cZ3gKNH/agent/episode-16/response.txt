  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql v8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I searched common config/credential locations (/etc/mysql, /root, /app, /var, /home) and found no usable credentials (no ~/.my.cnf, /etc/debian.cnf empty of creds). No SQL queries have been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or the specific database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL without a reachable server and credentials. Please choose one of the options below and provide details, plus the exact database question you want answered (for example: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", \"select top 5 rows from orders where ...\").\n\nOptions to proceed (pick one):\n1) Remote DB (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, password, and optionally database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n2) Local socket: provide socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password, or indicate socket/peer auth. Example: socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock user=root password=secret\n\n3) Credentials file: give the filesystem path to a credentials/config file you want me to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it and extract credentials if present.\n\n4) Set up local server: if you permit, I can install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server and create users/databases here. This is more invasive; confirm if acceptable and provide desired DB name and credentials to create.\n\nAfter you provide one of the above and the exact question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement presented exactly as an operation per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single Markdown SQL code block containing one SQL statement). You will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse the output and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until I can produce the final answer and output it as Action: Answer with Final Answer: [ ... ].",
