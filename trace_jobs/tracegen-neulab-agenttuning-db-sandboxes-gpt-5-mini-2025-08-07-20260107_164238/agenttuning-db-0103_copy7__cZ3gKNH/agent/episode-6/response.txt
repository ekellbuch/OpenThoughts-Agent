  "analysis": "The MySQL client is installed and available (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). /etc/mysql exists and contains conf.d with files: mysqldump.cnf and mysql.cnf, and there is a my.cnf.fallback. No ~/.my.cnf in /root. We haven't executed any SQL. The next step is to inspect the config files (conf.d and debian.cnf) to see if any connection credentials or useful settings (socket, user) are present. If no credentials are discoverable, I will need you to provide the database connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, and the exact question you want answered) so I can prepare the single-line SQL statement per your rules.",
  "plan": "1) List /etc/mysql/conf.d and print the contents of mysqldump.cnf, mysql.cnf, and my.cnf.fallback to look for socket, host, user, or credential entries. 2) Print /etc/debian.cnf (commonly contains debian-sys-maint credentials) to check for a maintenance user/password that could allow connecting locally. 3) If we find usable credentials or socket info, I'll prepare an Action: Operation SQL statement (one-line in markdown) for you to run. If nothing useful is found, I'll ask you to provide connection details and the SQL question.\n\nThe commands below perform these inspections.",
