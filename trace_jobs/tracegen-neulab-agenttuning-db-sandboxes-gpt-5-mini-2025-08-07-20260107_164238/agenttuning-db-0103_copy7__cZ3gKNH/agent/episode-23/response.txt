  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I searched common config and credential locations (/etc/mysql, /etc/mysql/conf.d, /root, /var, /home, /app) and found no usable credentials (.my.cnf and /etc/debian.cnf did not contain connection info). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or authorized setting up a local server.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials or permission to install a local server. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details, plus the exact database question you want answered:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing remote DB (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit to use 3306), username, password, and optionally database name.\n  - Also provide the exact question to answer (e.g., \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status=\\'active\\'\", \"select top 5 rows from orders where ...\").\n  - Once you provide these, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement presented exactly as: Action: Operation followed by one Markdown SQL code block (one SQL statement on one line) for you to execute. You will run only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate as needed.\n\nOption 2 — Provide a credentials/config file path on this host:\n  - Give an absolute path (e.g., /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it to extract credentials and then proceed as in Option 1.\n\nOption 3 — Permit installation and start of a local DB server (invasive):\n  - Confirm you allow installing and starting a DB server in this container and indicate preference (mysql-server or mariadb-server), root password (or accept auto/blank), and any initial DB/user to create.\n  - If authorized, I will list the exact apt/system commands I will run and then: install the server, start it, create requested DB/user, and then run SQL to answer your question.\n\nOption 4 — Allow additional discovery/network scan:\n  - If you want me to attempt to find reachable MySQL servers on the network, provide explicit host(s)/CIDR ranges and permission to install network tools (nmap/net-tools). I will then probe only the hosts/ranges you authorize.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the connection details or the exact question. I will then produce the required Action: Operation with a single-line SQL statement (or, if you choose Option 3, I will first show the shell commands I will run to install/start a local server). I will not run any SQL or install software until you confirm.",
