  "analysis": "Current container state: the MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I inspected common configuration and credential locations (/etc/mysql, /etc/mysql/conf.d, /etc/mysql/my.cnf.fallback, /root, /var, /home, /app) and found no usable credentials (.my.cnf missing, /etc/debian.cnf empty of creds). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or specified the database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide connection details or authorize setting up/running a local server. Please choose one of these and supply the requested information:\n\n1) Connect to an existing database (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (omit to use 3306), username, password, and optionally database name, and state the exact question you want answered (for example: \"list tables in database X\", \"COUNT rows in table Y where status=\\'active\\'\", \"show schema for table Z\", etc.). Once you provide these, I will prepare a single Action: Operation with one SQL code block (one-line SQL) for you to execute.\n\n2) Provide a path to a credentials/config file on this host (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it to extract credentials and then proceed as in option 1.\n\n3) Permit me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (invasive). If you allow this, state which server (mysql-server or mariadb-server), desired root password (or indicate auto/blank for testing), and any initial DB/user to create. I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\n4) Authorize additional discovery/network scanning: if you want me to try to find reachable MySQL servers on the network, specify hosts/CIDR ranges to probe and whether installation of network tools (nmap/net-tools) is allowed.\n\nAfter you choose and provide details plus the exact database question, I will create the first Action: Operation containing a single-line SQL statement in a single Markdown SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate with further single SQL statements until I can produce the final Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].",
