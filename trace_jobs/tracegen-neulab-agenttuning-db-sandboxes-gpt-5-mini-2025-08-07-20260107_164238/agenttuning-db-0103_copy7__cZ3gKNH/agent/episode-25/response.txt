  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server discovered (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I inspected common config/credential locations (/etc/mysql and conf.d, /root, /var, /home, /app) and found no usable credentials (no ~/.my.cnf, /etc/debian.cnf had no credentials). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or asked a specific database question.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until there is a reachable MySQL server and credentials or until you permit me to set up one locally. Please choose one of these options and provide the requested details (and the exact question you want answered):\n\n1) Connect to an existing DB (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (omit to use 3306), username, password, and optionally database name; also state the exact query goal (e.g., \"list tables in DB X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", etc.). After you provide these I will prepare a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run.\n\n2) Provide a credentials/config file path on this host (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it to extract connection details and then proceed as in option 1.\n\n3) Permit installation and start of a local DB server in this container (invasive): confirm you allow installing mysql-server or mariadb-server, provide desired root password (or allow auto/blank for testing) and any initial DB/user to create. If you permit this, I will list the exact apt/system commands I will run and then perform the installation, start the server, create users/DBs, and then run SQL to answer your question.\n\n4) Authorize additional discovery/network scan: if you want me to try to find reachable MySQL servers on the network, provide explicit hosts/CIDR ranges to probe and permission to install network tools (nmap/net-tools). I will only scan hosts/ranges you authorize.\n\nOnce you provide the connection details or authorize one of the options above and state the exact database question, I will produce exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement (in a Markdown SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate with further single SQL statements until I can give the final Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].",
