  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, v8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process). I inspected common config locations (/etc/mysql, /root, /app, /var, /home) and found no credentials (no ~/.my.cnf, /etc/debian.cnf lacked usable creds). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or the database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials or permission to set one up. Please provide one of the following and the exact question you want answered:\n\n1) Remote DB credentials: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, password, and optional database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n2) Local socket credentials or path: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password (or indicate socket/peer auth).\n\n3) Path to a credentials/config file to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it and extract credentials.\n\n4) If you prefer, authorize me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (I will install the server package and create users/databases as needed).\n\nAfter you provide the chosen option and the exact database question (e.g., \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", etc.), I will prepare a single-line SQL statement and present it exactly in the required format: Label it \"Action: Operation\" and include one SQL code block (single-line SQL). You will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate with further single SQL statements until I can output the final answer as \"Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [ ... ]\".",
