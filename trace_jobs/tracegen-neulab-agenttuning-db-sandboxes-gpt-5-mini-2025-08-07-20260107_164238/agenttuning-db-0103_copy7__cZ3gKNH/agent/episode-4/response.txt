  "analysis": "The container now has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket and no mysqld process). The default client config file (/etc/mysql/my.cnf) is present but only includes /etc/mysql/conf.d/. At this point we cannot run any SQL because there is no reachable server and no credentials provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the database connection details so I can run SQL. Please tell me: host (or socket path), port (if not default 3306), username, password (or let me know if ~/.my.cnf contains credentials), and the database name (if applicable). Also tell me the exact question you want answered (for example: list tables in schema X, count rows in table Y, return rows matching condition Z, etc.).\n\nOnce you provide connection details and the query request, I will:\n- Prepare a single SQL statement (one-line) in the required format and label it as Action: Operation.\n- You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output.\n- I will parse the output, iterate with further single SQL statements as needed, and finally produce Action: Answer with the exact final answer array when done.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also attempt to connect now to a local socket or to a remote host if you give credentials. If you want me to search the filesystem for possible credential files (e.g., ~/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/conf.d/*) I can do that too — tell me to proceed and I will run those diagnostics.",
