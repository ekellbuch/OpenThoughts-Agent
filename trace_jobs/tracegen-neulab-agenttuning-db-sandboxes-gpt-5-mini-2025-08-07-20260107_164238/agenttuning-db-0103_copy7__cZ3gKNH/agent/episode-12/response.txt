  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql v8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). I inspected common config and credential locations (/etc/mysql, /root, /app, /var, etc.) and found no usable credentials. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or the specific database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials. Please provide one of the following and the exact question you want answered:\n\n1) Remote DB credentials: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and (optionally) database name. Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n2) Local socket credentials: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, and password (or indicate socket/peer auth). Example: socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock user=root password=secret\n\n3) Path to a credentials/config file you want me to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it and extract connection details.\n\nAlso state the exact SQL question (for example: \"list tables in database X\", \"show schema for table Y\", \"count rows in table Z where status='active'\", \"select top 5 rows from table T where ...\", etc.).\n\nOnce you provide connection info and the precise question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement and present it in the exact required format: \n- Label: Action: Operation\n- One SQL code block in Markdown, containing a single SQL statement on one line. \nYou will execute only that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse the output and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until I can produce the final answer, at which point I will output Action: Answer with Final Answer: [ ... ].",
