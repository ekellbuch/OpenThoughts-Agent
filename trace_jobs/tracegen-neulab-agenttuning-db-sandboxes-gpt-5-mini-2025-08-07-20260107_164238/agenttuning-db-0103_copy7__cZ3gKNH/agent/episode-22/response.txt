  "analysis": "Summary of current state: the container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running or discoverable (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). I searched common locations for credentials and config files (/root/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql, /etc/debian.cnf, /app, /var, /home) and found no usable credentials. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or asked a concrete database question.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until I either have credentials for an existing server or permission to install and start a local server in this container. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details (and the exact question you want answered). I will then proceed and present a single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nOptions to proceed (pick one):\n\n1) Connect to an existing remote DB (recommended):\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit to use 3306), username, password, and optionally database name.\n   - Also provide the exact query goal (examples: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table Y where status=\\'active\\'\", \"show schema for table Z\", \"select top 5 rows from orders ordered by created_at desc\").\n   - After you provide these, I will prepare exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement for you to run; you'll return the raw mysql output and I will iterate as needed.\n\n2) Provide a credentials/config file path to inspect:\n   - Give an absolute path (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I will read it to extract credentials and then proceed as in option (1).\n\n3) Allow me to install and start a local DB server in this container (invasive):\n   - If you permit, tell me which server you prefer (mysql-server or mariadb-server), provide the desired root password (or tell me to create a test user/db), and confirm you accept the changes.\n   - If authorized, I will run the following sequence of shell actions (I will present them and run them only after your explicit approval):\n       a) apt-get update && apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server) to install a server.\n       b) Start the server (service mysql start || systemctl start mysql || mysqld_safe & depending on the environment).\n       c) Secure or configure the server as requested (set root password or create a dedicated user).\n       d) Create a database/user if you request, e.g. mysql -u root -e \"CREATE DATABASE mydb; CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass'; GRANT ALL ON mydb.* TO 'user'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"\n       e) Connect with the provided/new credentials and run the SQL statements needed to answer your question.\n   - Note: starting a server in a minimal container can require adjustments; I will report any errors and adapt commands as needed.\n\n4) Allow further discovery/network scan (requires permission to install tools):\n   - If you want me to look for remote MySQL servers on the network, tell me the host(s)/CIDR ranges to probe and whether installing tools (nmap/net-tools) is allowed. I can then attempt to detect reachable MySQL endpoints.\n\nIf you choose option 1 or 2, please also state the exact database question you want answered. Once you provide the connection details or authorize one of the other actions, I will proceed. When operating against a database I will follow your rule: I will present a single Action: Operation followed by exactly one SQL code block (one line) and you will execute only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will then parse results and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until delivering the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format.",
