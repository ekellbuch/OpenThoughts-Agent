  "analysis": "The environment has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql v8.0.44) but there is no local MySQL server running and no credentials were found in common locations. I inspected /etc/mysql and conf.d but found no usable connection info. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or the specific question to answer.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I have a reachable MySQL server and credentials. Please provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n1) Remote connection details (preferred): host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password, and optional database name. Example format: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=alice password=secret db=mydb\n\n2) Local socket and credentials: socket path (e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), username, password or indicate socket/peer auth. Example: socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock user=root password=secret\n\n3) Path to a credentials/config file you want me to inspect (for example /root/.my.cnf or /etc/debian.cnf). I can read it and extract credentials.\n\nAlso tell me the exact database question you want answered (examples: \"list all tables in database X\", \"COUNT rows in table Y where status='active'\", \"show schema for table Z\", \"select top 5 rows from table T where ...\", etc.).\n\nOnce you provide connection info and the precise question, I will prepare a single-line SQL statement wrapped exactly as Action: Operation with a single SQL code block (per your rules). You will run only that SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate with further single SQL statements as needed until I produce the final Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer array.\n\nIf you prefer I can perform more automatic discovery (e.g., search additional paths or scan network for open MySQL ports). Tell me which discovery action to take and I will run the appropriate shell commands.",
