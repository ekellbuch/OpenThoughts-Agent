  "analysis": "Current environment: you are in /app inside a container. There is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld/mariadbd process is running, no MySQL data files were visible under /var/lib/mysql, and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf is not present. In short: there is no local MySQL server or client available right now. To run SQL queries against a MySQL server from this shell I must first install a MySQL client (or MariaDB client). If the database is remote, I'll also need connection details (host, port, username, password or a socket).",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package so we can execute SQL statements from this shell. I'll run apt-get update and then install the default MySQL client non-interactively. 2) Verify the client installation by running mysql --version. 3) Check for a local MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) in case a local server appears. After these steps I'll report readiness and wait for your MySQL question and connection details (host, port, user, password or socket).",
