  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app with no prior commands shown. No MySQL client or server state is known yet. Nothing has been queried and no SQL has been run. To answer later MySQL questions I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB client is available, whether a server is running, where the data/configuration files are, and whether any local credentials (for example in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf) exist so I can connect non-interactively. After that I will run the requested single SQL statement (you asked that every SQL be a single statement in a single markdown code block).",
  "plan": "1) Check current directory and environment. 2) Locate the mysql client binary and show its version. 3) Check for a running mysqld/mariadbd process. 4) Inspect listening sockets to see if MySQL is listening. 5) List /var/lib/mysql to see databases/data files. 6) Show potential local MySQL credential files such as /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which often contain a maintenance user's credentials. Based on findings I'll either connect using those credentials or report what remains needed. Each command is chosen to gather evidence; no SQL will be executed yet until you give the question or I am instructed to run an SQL statement.",
