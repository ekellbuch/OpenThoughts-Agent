  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database to query from this container. I cannot run any SQL until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server, or (B) confirm that I should install and start a local server here and supply any preferences/credentials for that installation.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the needed details. I will not change the system or install a server without explicit confirmation.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote server (recommended if your data already exists):\n- You must provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for 3306), username, password (or other auth), and database name (or say 'list databases').\n- Also tell me the goal (e.g., list tables, count rows, specific SELECT). After you provide those, I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will run and why, and then (2) output exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a single fenced SQL code block for you to execute with the mysql client using the provided connection details.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want installation and choose MySQL or MariaDB. Provide a root password (or indicate socket auth) and optionally an initial DB name and user/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run the apt-get install and initialization steps, start the server, create any requested database/user, verify the server is running, then (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a single fenced SQL code block for you to execute locally.\n\nIf you'd like, I can proceed with a safe default for Option B (install MariaDB, use socket auth for root, create DB 'testdb' and user 'tester' with password 'testerpass'). Reply with either Option A and connection details or Option B and confirmation/preferences.",
