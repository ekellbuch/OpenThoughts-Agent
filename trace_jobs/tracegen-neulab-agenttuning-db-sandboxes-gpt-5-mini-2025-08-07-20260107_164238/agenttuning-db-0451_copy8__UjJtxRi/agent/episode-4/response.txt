  "analysis": "The MySQL client has been installed successfully (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no listener on default locations was found (ss was not present to check ports, but socket and filesystem checks show no server). So currently I cannot run any SQL against a database until I have a reachable MySQL server (either a remote host or a local server to install and start). Nothing has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any more system commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. You have two main options:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing (remote) MySQL server:\n- Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate if you want to attempt a socket/peer authentication), and the database name to query.\n- Once you provide those, I will craft a single-line SQL statement (in the exact markdown format you required) for you to execute. I will also explain the SQL and my reasoning before producing the SQL. Remember: you will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block I provide.\n\nOption B — Run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- If you want a local server here, I can install and initialize MariaDB or MySQL server and start it. That requires installing additional packages and setting a root password or using socket-based auth. If you choose this, confirm and I will install (e.g., apt-get install -y mariadb-server) and then prepare a database and credentials. After the server is running I can run SQL queries locally.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and, if Option A, give the connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database). If Option B, confirm you want me to install/start a server and any preferences for root password or database names.\n",
