  "analysis": "So far I inspected the environment. I'm root in /app. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf is absent. That means there is currently no MySQL server or client obvious on this container and no standard Debian maintenance credentials. To proceed to run SQL I need either a MySQL/MariaDB client available to connect to a server, or a local server running. Right now nothing has been accomplished towards connecting to a database.",
  "plan": "Search the system for any MySQL/MariaDB binaries, sockets, config directories, or environment variables that might indicate where a database is or how to connect. If I find a client (mysql, mariadb) I'll use it; if I find a socket or service I'll try to connect; if none exist I'll report that the MySQL client/server is not present and request either credentials/host info or permission to install a client. Commands to run:\n1) type -a mysql mariadb mysqladmin mysqld -- to see if any client/server binaries exist in PATH.\n2) ls /etc and /var/run to look for mysql/mariadb config or sockets.\n3) find at limited depth for files/dirs with \"mysql\" or \"mariadb\" in their names to locate any installations (limit depth to avoid long searches).\n4) print environment variables that might hint at DB connection info.\nThese will help determine next steps (connect, install client, or ask for more info).",
