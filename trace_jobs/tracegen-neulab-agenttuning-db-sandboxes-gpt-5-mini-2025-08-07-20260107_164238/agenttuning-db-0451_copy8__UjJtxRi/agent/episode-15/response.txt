  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed and there is no reachable database from this container. To proceed I need either remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or explicit confirmation to install and start a local server here (and any preferences such as MySQL vs MariaDB and root password / initial DB/user).",
  "plan": "Wait for you to choose one of two options and provide required details. Option A: provide remote connection parameters and the desired query/goal; I will then explain the SQL I intend to run and supply exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block for you to execute. Option B: confirm installation of a local DB server and give preferences (MySQL or MariaDB, root password or socket auth, initial DB/user); I will install and initialize the server and then produce/explain the SQL to run. I will not run further system commands without your explicit choice.",
