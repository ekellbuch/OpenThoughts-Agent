  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client has been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running or present locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket. Therefore no SQL has been executed against any database. To proceed I need either (A) connection details for an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server, or (B) permission to install and start a local database server in this container so we can create and query databases locally.",
  "plan": "I will not run further system commands until you choose how to proceed. Two supported paths (pick one):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if your data already exists remotely):\n- Provide these details: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate if password omitted / socket / SSL / other auth), and the database name (or say \"list databases\"). Also tell me the exact goal (e.g., list tables in db, count rows in table X, select rows with condition Y).\n- Once you provide those, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and then (2) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a fenced SQL code block as required. You will run only that SQL (with the mysql client and the provided connection details) and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and continue.\n- Example client usage you would run to execute my SQL: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL from my first SQL block>\".\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (if no remote DB available):\n- Confirm you want installation and state preference (MySQL vs MariaDB). Provide a root password (or say use socket auth). Optionally provide an initial database name and a username/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run the necessary apt-get install commands, initialize and start the server, create any requested DB/user, and then (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a fenced SQL code block for you to execute locally with the mysql client.\n- Typical install steps I would run (if you choose B):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-server    (or mysql-server if you prefer)\n  3) start the server (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb depending on package)\n  4) secure setup / create DB and user via mysql -u root -e \"...\" commands\n\nImportant: Per your rules, every SQL I provide will be exactly one statement, on one line, inside a single fenced SQL code block. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (connection parameters for A, or installation preferences and credentials for B). After that I will (1) explain the single-line SQL I will run and why, and then (2) provide that SQL in the required single fenced SQL block for you to execute.",
