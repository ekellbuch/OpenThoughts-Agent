  "analysis": "From previous inspection: there is no MySQL/MariaDB client or server installed on this container (mysql command not found, no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql). I am root in /app. At this point there is no local MySQL instance to query. To run SQL you need either (A) a MySQL client to connect to a remote or local server, or (B) a local server installed and started. Since no client exists, the immediate step is to install a MySQL-compatible client so we can connect to a database (local or remote) and then run the single-line SQL statements you require.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package so we can run mysql commands. I will update apt and install the default-mysql-client package. This gives the mysql client binary.\n2) Verify the client installation by printing mysql --version.\n3) After the client is available, I'll ask you for the database host, port (if not default 3306), username, password (or socket), and database name, or whether there is a local server to start. Once I have connection details I will craft the one-line SQL query you request in the required markdown format and you will execute it.\n\nCommands to run now: apt-get update, apt-get install default-mysql-client -y, then mysql --version to confirm.",
