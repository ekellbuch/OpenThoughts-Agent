  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Because there is no reachable database yet, I have not executed any SQL statements. To proceed I need either remote connection parameters for an existing MySQL server or confirmation to install and start a local server in this container.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two options. I will describe exactly what I will do for each, what information I need from you, and what the next command(s) or SQL will be.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- What I need from you: host (IP or DNS), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate if passwordless / socket / SSL auth), and the database name (or tell me to list databases).\n- Once you provide those, I will explain the single-line SQL I plan to run (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM db; or a specific SELECT you request). I will then provide exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line) as required. You will run that SQL with the mysql client (using the connection details you provided) and return the raw MySQL output. After you return the output I will analyze it and either produce the next SQL or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- What I need from you: confirm you want me to install a server, choose MySQL vs MariaDB (if you have a preference), provide a root password (or tell me to use socket auth), and optionally give a database name and a user/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run apt-get install for the chosen server, initialize and start it, create any requested DB/user, and then I will either (1) run queries locally or (2) provide the single-line SQL for you to execute locally. I will explain each SQL before giving it, and I will only provide one SQL code block at a time as required.\n\nNotes about the SQL/operation workflow (requirements you stated):\n- Every time I produce SQL it will be in a single fenced SQL code block and contain exactly one statement on one line. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. I will base next steps on that output.\n- If you want me to proceed now, reply with either:\n  - Option A and the connection details, e.g. { \"host\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"port\": 3306, \"user\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"s3cr3t\", \"database\": \"prod\" }\n  - or Option B and installation details, e.g. \"Install MariaDB, root password: <pw>, create DB: <name>, create user: <user>/<pw>\".\n\nIf you are unsure which to choose: tell me the goal/query you want answered (for example: \"List all users with last_login before 2024-01-01\" or \"Count rows in table X in db Y\"). If a remote DB exists I can craft the appropriate SQL; if not, we can install a local server and load/simulate data as needed.",
