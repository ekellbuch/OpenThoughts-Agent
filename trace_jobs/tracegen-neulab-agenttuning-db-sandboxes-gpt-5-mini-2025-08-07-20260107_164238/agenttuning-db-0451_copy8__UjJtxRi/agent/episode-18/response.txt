  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database from this container. To proceed I either need (A) remote database connection parameters so I can connect with the installed mysql client, or (B) explicit confirmation to install and start a local DB server here and any preferences/credentials for that installation. You have not yet provided either.",
  "plan": "I will not perform any more system changes without your confirmation. Please choose one of the two clearly described options and provide the requested details. Once you choose, I will (1) explain the exact single-line SQL I will run and why, and then (2) present exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line) as you required. You will run only the SQL inside that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server (recommended if your data exists remotely):\n- Provide these connection details and the query goal:\n  { \"option\": \"A\", \"host\": \"<host_or_ip>\", \"port\": <port_or_omit_for_3306>, \"user\": \"<username>\", \"password\": \"<password>\", \"database\": \"<dbname>\", \"goal\": \"<what you want, e.g. list tables or count rows>\" }\n- After you supply that I will explain the SQL I will run and then give the single-line SQL in a SQL code block for you to execute via the mysql client (example execution: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nOption B — Install and run a local DB server in this container (if no remote DB exists):\n- Confirm with preferences and credentials, for example:\n  { \"option\": \"B\", \"server\": \"mariadb\" | \"mysql\", \"root_password\": \"<pw_or_null_for_socket_auth>\", \"create_db\": \"<optional_db_name>\", \"create_user\": { \"name\": \"<user>\", \"password\": \"<pw>\" } }\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested DB/user, then explain and present the single-line SQL to run next.\n\nIf you are unsure, say whether you want me to: (1) attempt to connect to a remote DB and give the connection details, or (2) install a local DB server here with reasonable defaults. Example reasonable-default install I can run if you approve: install MariaDB, use socket auth for root (no root password), create database 'testdb' and user 'tester'@'localhost' with password 'testerpass'.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required parameters. After you do, I will describe the SQL I will execute and then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block for you to run.",
