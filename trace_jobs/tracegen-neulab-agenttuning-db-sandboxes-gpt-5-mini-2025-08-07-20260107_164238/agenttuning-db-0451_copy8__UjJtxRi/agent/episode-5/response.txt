  "analysis": "You have a shell with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). I attempted to detect any local server or socket and found none. To run SQL I need either: (A) credentials and access to a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database), or (B) permission to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container so we can create/use databases locally. No SQL has been executed yet because there is no target database to query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote/external MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide connection info: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate if passwordless/SSL/socket auth), and the database name (or tell me to list databases).\n- Once you provide that, I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (one line) per your rules. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (if no remote DB is available):\n- Confirm you want me to install a server here. If yes, tell me any preference: MySQL vs MariaDB, desired root password (or allow socket auth), and any initial database/user to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run apt-get install for the chosen server, initialize/start it, and create any requested DB/user. After that I will craft the SQL you request and present it as described.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any needed connection details or installation preferences. I will then (1) detail the exact single-line SQL I will run and why, and (2) include the SQL in a single fenced SQL code block per your rules for you to execute.",
