  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app. I installed the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) in this container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server available locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, and no socket. Because there is no reachable database, no SQL has been executed. To proceed I need either: (A) connection details for an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server so I can craft a query for you to run with the mysql client, or (B) explicit confirmation to install and start a local DB server in this container (and any preferences/credentials) so we can run queries locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required details. After you choose I will (1) explain the single-line SQL I plan to run and why, then (2) present exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line) per your workflow rules. Options and required info:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server (recommended if your data already exists remotely):\n- Provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate alternative auth), database name (or ask to list databases), and the goal (e.g., \"list tables\", \"count rows in table X\", \"select rows with condition Y\").\n- Example payload you can paste: { \"option\":\"A\", \"host\":\"1.2.3.4\", \"port\":3306, \"user\":\"alice\", \"password\":\"s3cr3t\", \"database\":\"prod\", \"goal\":\"list tables\" }.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container (if no remote DB exists):\n- Confirm that I should install and state preference (mysql or mariadb). Provide a root password (or say use socket auth) and optionally an initial DB name and a username/password to create.\n- Example payload: { \"option\":\"B\", \"server\":\"mariadb\", \"root_password\":null, \"create_db\":\"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"tester\",\"password\":\"testerpass\"} }.\n\nWhen you reply with Option A and connection details or Option B with installation preferences, I will: a) explain the SQL I will run and why, and b) output exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL block (one line). You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output, after which I will continue.",
