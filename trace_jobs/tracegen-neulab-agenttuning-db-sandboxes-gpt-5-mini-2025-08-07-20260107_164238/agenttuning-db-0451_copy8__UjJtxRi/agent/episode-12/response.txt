  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Because there is no reachable database from this container, no SQL has been executed. To proceed I need either remote connection details for an existing MySQL server or your confirmation to install and start a local server here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options. Provide one of the following and I will proceed as described:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if your data already exists remotely):\n- Provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless/SSL/socket auth), and database name (or request listing databases).\n- Also tell me the goal (e.g., list tables, count rows in table X, select rows matching condition). Once you give these, I will (1) explain the exact single-line SQL I will run and why, and then (2) output exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line) for you to execute with the mysql client using the provided connection details.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want installation and specify preference (MySQL or MariaDB). Provide a root password (or say to use socket auth) and optionally an initial DB name and user/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create any requested DB/user, verify the server is running, and then (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL code block for you to execute locally.\n\nIf unsure, state the exact question you want answered about the database (for example: \"Count users with status='active' in database appdb\"). If a remote DB exists, include its connection parameters. If you want a local DB here, confirm installation preferences.\n\nWhen you reply, include either:\n- Option A and the connection details plus the query goal (e.g. { \"option\":\"A\", \"host\":\"1.2.3.4\", \"port\":3306, \"user\":\"alice\", \"password\":\"s3cr3t\", \"database\":\"prod\", \"goal\":\"list tables\" })\n- OR Option B with installation preferences (e.g. { \"option\":\"B\", \"server\":\"mariadb\", \"root_password\":\"pw123\", \"create_db\":\"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"bob\",\"password\":\"pw456\"} })\n\nAfter you provide one of those, I will explain the exact SQL to run and then provide the single-line SQL block per your rules.",
