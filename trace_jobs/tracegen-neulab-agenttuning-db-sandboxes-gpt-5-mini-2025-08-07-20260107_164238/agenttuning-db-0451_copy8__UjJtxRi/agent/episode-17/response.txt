  "analysis": "You are root in /app. The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database. To proceed I need either (A) connection details for an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server or (B) explicit confirmation to install and start a local DB server in this container (and any preferences/passwords).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required details. I will not run any further system commands until you pick one.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if your data already exists remotely):\n- Provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless/SSL/socket auth), and database name (or indicate you want to list databases).\n- Also tell me the goal (e.g., \"list tables\", \"count rows in table X\", \"select rows matching condition Y\").\n- Once you provide those, I will explain the single-line SQL I will run and why, then output exactly one single-line SQL statement (inside a fenced SQL block) for you to execute. Example client usage to run my SQL (you would run locally): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\".\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want installation and state preference (MySQL or MariaDB). Provide a root password (or say to use socket auth). Optionally give an initial database name and a username/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run commands to install and start the server, initialize the data directory (if needed), create the requested DB/user, and then explain the SQL I will run and produce the single-line SQL statement (inside a fenced SQL block) for you to execute locally.\n\nIf you want a recommended default for Option B I can proceed with: install MariaDB, use socket authentication for root (no password), create database 'testdb', create user 'tester'@'localhost' with password 'testerpass' and grant privileges. If you approve that default, I will run the apt-get install and initialization commands and then proceed.\n\nPlease reply with one clear choice and the required parameters, for example:\n- Option A: { \"option\":\"A\", \"host\":\"1.2.3.4\", \"port\":3306, \"user\":\"alice\", \"password\":\"s3cr3t\", \"database\":\"prod\", \"goal\":\"list tables\" }\n- Option B: { \"option\":\"B\", \"server\":\"mariadb\", \"root_password\":null, \"create_db\":\"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"tester\",\"password\":\"testerpass\"} }\n\nAfter you provide that I will (1) explain the exact SQL I will execute and why, then (2) provide exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a fenced SQL code block for you to run (per your rules).",
