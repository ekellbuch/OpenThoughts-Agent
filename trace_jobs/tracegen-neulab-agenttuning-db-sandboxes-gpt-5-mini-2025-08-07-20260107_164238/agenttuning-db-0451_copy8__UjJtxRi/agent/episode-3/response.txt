  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client (mysql) successfully. Previously there was no MySQL server or client on the system; now the client exists (mysql Ver 8.0.44). No database connection has been made yet. To run SQL I still need a reachable MySQL server (local or remote) and credentials. Right now I have not identified any running mysqld instance or socket to connect to.",
  "plan": "Check for any local MySQL server or socket so we can attempt a local connection if one exists. Specifically:\n- Check listening TCP ports for 3306 (default MySQL) to see if any server is listening.\n- List /var/run/mysqld (common socket location) to see if a UNIX socket exists.\n- Search for any mysql-related .sock files in the filesystem (limited depth) in case the server created a socket elsewhere.\nBased on results, I'll either attempt a local connection or ask you for host/port/username/password/database details so I can craft the single-line SQL you want executed.",
