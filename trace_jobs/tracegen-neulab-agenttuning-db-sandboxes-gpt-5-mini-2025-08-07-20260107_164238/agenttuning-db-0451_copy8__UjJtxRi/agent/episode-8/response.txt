  "analysis": "You are root in /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully, but there is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed against any database yet. To proceed I must either connect to an existing remote MySQL server (requires connection details) or install and start a local server in this container (requires permission and installation choices).",
  "plan": "I will not run further system commands until you choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the following options and provide the requested information.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless/SSL/other auth), and database name (or say \"list databases\").\n- After you provide connection details and the query you want, I will explain the SQL I will run and present exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a fenced SQL block as required. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here:\n- Confirm installation and specify preference (MySQL or MariaDB), provide a root password or say to use socket auth, and optionally name any initial database and user to create.\n- If confirmed I will install and initialize the server, start it, create requested DB/user, then explain the SQL to run and provide the single-line SQL block for you to execute.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- Option A and connection details, for example: { \"option\": \"A\", \"host\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"port\": 3306, \"user\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"s3cr3t\", \"database\": \"prod\" }\n- OR Option B and installation preferences, for example: { \"option\": \"B\", \"server\": \"mariadb\", \"root_password\": \"pw123\", \"create_db\": \"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"bob\",\"password\":\"pw456\"} }\n\nOnce you provide that, I will (1) explain the single-line SQL I will run and why, and then (2) output exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block for you to execute.",
