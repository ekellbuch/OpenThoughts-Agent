  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working, but there is no MySQL server present or running locally (no mysqld, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed and there is no reachable database from this container yet. To proceed I must either connect to an existing remote MySQL server (you provide host/port/user/password/database) or install and start a local server in this container (you must confirm and give any preferences/passwords).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options. After you choose I will explain the exact single-line SQL I will run and why, then provide exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block for you to execute (per your rules).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have the DB):\n- You must provide: host (IP or DNS), port (omit for 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless/auth method), and database name (or say \"list databases\").\n- Once you provide these, I will: (1) explain the SQL to run, and (2) output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block for you to execute with the mysql client using the connection info you supplied (example client usage I would run locally: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD -D DATABASE).\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server here:\n- Confirm you want installation and give preferences: choose \"mysql\" or \"mariadb\", provide a root password (or say use socket auth), and optionally a database name and a user/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run these commands to set up a local server and create the requested DB/user:\n  - apt-get update\n  - apt-get install -y mariadb-server   (or mysql-server if you prefer)\n  - systemctl start mariadb  (or start the service appropriate to the package)\n  - mysql -u root -p<rootpw> -e \"CREATE DATABASE ...; CREATE USER ...; GRANT ...;\"\n- After the server is running I will explain the SQL to run and then provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block for you to execute locally.\n\nPlease reply with one of the following so I can proceed:\n- Option A with connection details, e.g. { \"option\": \"A\", \"host\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"port\": 3306, \"user\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"s3cr3t\", \"database\": \"prod\", \"goal\": \"list tables\" }\n- OR Option B with installation preferences, e.g. { \"option\": \"B\", \"server\": \"mariadb\", \"root_password\": \"pw123\", \"create_db\": \"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"bob\",\"password\":\"pw456\"} }\n\nAfter you provide that I will (1) describe the exact SQL I will execute and why, then (2) produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to run and return the raw MySQL output.",
