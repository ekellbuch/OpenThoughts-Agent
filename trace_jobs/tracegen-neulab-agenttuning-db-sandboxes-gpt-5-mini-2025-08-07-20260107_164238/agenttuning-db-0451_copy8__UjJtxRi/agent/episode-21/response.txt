  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed successfully in this container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed and there is no reachable database from this container. To proceed I need either remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) so I can connect with the installed mysql client, or explicit confirmation to install and start a local DB server in this container (and any preferences/credentials for that installation).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required details. After you provide them I will: (1) explain the exact single-line SQL I intend to run and why, and then (2) present exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line) per your rules. Options:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server: provide host, port (omit for 3306), user, password (or auth method), database name, and the goal/query (e.g., list tables, count rows, select rows matching a condition). Example payload: { \"option\":\"A\", \"host\":\"1.2.3.4\", \"port\":3306, \"user\":\"alice\", \"password\":\"s3cr3t\", \"database\":\"prod\", \"goal\":\"list tables\" }.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local DB server in this container: confirm installation and specify preference (mysql or mariadb), root password (or socket auth), and optionally an initial DB name and user/password to create. Example payload: { \"option\":\"B\", \"server\":\"mariadb\", \"root_password\":null, \"create_db\":\"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"tester\",\"password\":\"testerpass\"} }.\n\nI will not make further system changes or run SQL until you select one option and provide the required parameters. Once you do, I will (before issuing any SQL) explain the SQL and its purpose, then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required fenced SQL block format for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
