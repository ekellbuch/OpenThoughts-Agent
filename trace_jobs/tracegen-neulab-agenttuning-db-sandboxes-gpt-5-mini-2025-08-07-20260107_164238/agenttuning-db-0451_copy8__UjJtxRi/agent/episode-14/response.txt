  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database to query from this container. I cannot perform any SQL operations until you either provide remote DB connection details or permit me to install and start a local DB server here.",
  "plan": "I will not perform destructive or unrequested actions without your confirmation. Choose one of the two options below and give the requested details; after you do I will (1) explain the exact single-line SQL I will run and why, then (2) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a single fenced SQL code block for you to execute (per your rules).\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server (recommended if your data already exists):\n- Provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate alternative auth), and the database name (or ask to list databases). Also state the goal/query (e.g., list tables, count rows, select rows matching condition).\n- After you provide these, I will explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block for you to execute with the mysql client using the provided connection details.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want installation and state preference (MySQL or MariaDB). Provide a root password (or say use socket auth). Optionally provide an initial database name and a username/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I'll run commands to install and start the server, initialize the data directory, and create any requested DB/user. After the server is up I will explain the SQL I will run and then provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block for you to execute locally.\n\nIf you want me to proceed immediately with Option B using reasonable defaults, say so (for example: \"Install MariaDB, use socket auth for root, create DB 'testdb' and user 'tester' with password 'pw'\"), and I will run the installation steps and continue. If you prefer Option A, provide the connection parameters and the query goal.",
