  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running or present locally (no mysqld process, /var/lib/mysql, or socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed and there is no reachable database from this container. To proceed I need either remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or explicit confirmation to install and start a local server (and any preferences such as MySQL vs MariaDB and root password / initial DB/user).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of two options and provide the requested details. After you provide them I will (1) explain the single-line SQL I will run and why, and (2) output exactly one single-line SQL statement inside a single fenced SQL code block (per your stated rules).\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (do this if your data already exists remotely):\n- Provide: host (IP or hostname), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate alternative auth), and database name (or say \"list databases\").\n- Also tell me the goal/query (e.g., list tables, count rows in table X, select rows with condition Y).\n- After you provide these, I'll explain the SQL I will run and then provide the single-line SQL in the required format for you to execute with the mysql client using the given connection parameters.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (do this if no remote DB exists):\n- Confirm you want installation and specify preference (MySQL or MariaDB). Provide a root password (or say use socket auth). Optionally provide an initial database name and a username/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create any requested DB/user, verify the server is running, then explain and provide the single-line SQL for you to execute locally.\n\nWhen you reply, include either:\n- Option A with connection details and the query goal, e.g. { \"option\":\"A\", \"host\":\"1.2.3.4\", \"port\":3306, \"user\":\"alice\", \"password\":\"s3cr3t\", \"database\":\"prod\", \"goal\":\"list tables\" }\n- OR Option B with installation preferences, e.g. { \"option\":\"B\", \"server\":\"mariadb\", \"root_password\":\"pw123\", \"create_db\":\"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"bob\",\"password\":\"pw456\"} }\n\nI will not run further commands until you choose one of these options. If you want me to proceed with installing a local server using reasonable defaults now, say so and I will run the necessary apt-get commands and continue.",
