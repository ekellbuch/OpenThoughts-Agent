  "analysis": "Current state: the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server available or running in the container (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Therefore no SQL could be executed against a database yet. To proceed we need either remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or to install and start a local DB server in this container. You have not provided connection details, so I'll proceed to install and start a local MariaDB server with a small test database and user so we can run SQL locally. After installation I'll create a database named testdb and a user tester with password testerpass (you can change these later).",
  "plan": "1) Install MariaDB server (apt-get install -y mariadb-server). 2) Start the MariaDB/MySQL service. 3) Use the mysql client (socket auth as root) to create a database testdb and a user tester@localhost with password 'testerpass' and grant privileges on testdb. 4) Verify by listing databases. Expected outcome: a running local MariaDB server, a database testdb, and a user tester with privileges, plus ability to run SQL locally with the mysql client (or I can craft SQL for you to run remotely if you provide connection details).",
