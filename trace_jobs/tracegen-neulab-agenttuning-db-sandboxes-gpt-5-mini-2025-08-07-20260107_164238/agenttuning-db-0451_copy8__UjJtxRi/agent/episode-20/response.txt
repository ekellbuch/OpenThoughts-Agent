  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully in this container, but there is no MySQL/MariaDB server running or present locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed and there is no reachable database from this container. I cannot run any SQL until you either provide connection details for a remote MySQL server or explicitly allow installing and starting a local server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will not change the system or install a server without your explicit choice. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested details. After you respond I will (1) explain the exact single-line SQL I will run and why, and then (2) present exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line) as required by your workflow. You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL/MariaDB server (recommended if your data already exists remotely):\n- Provide a JSON-like set of connection parameters and the goal, for example:\n  { \"option\": \"A\", \"host\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"port\": 3306, \"user\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"s3cr3t\", \"database\": \"prod\", \"goal\": \"list tables\" }\n- After you provide this I will explain the SQL to run (what it does and why) and then output exactly one single-line SQL statement in a fenced SQL block (the statement will be the first code block and you will run it). Example client execution you would run locally: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\".\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want installation and provide preferences, for example:\n  { \"option\": \"B\", \"server\": \"mariadb\" | \"mysql\", \"root_password\": \"<pw_or_null_for_socket_auth>\", \"create_db\": \"<optional_db_name>\", \"create_user\": { \"name\": \"<user>\", \"password\": \"<pw>\" } }\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the chosen server, start it, create any requested DB/user, and then explain and provide the single-line SQL block for you to run locally. (I will run apt-get install only after your confirmation.)\n\nImportant reminders about the SQL workflow you requested:\n- Every operation (when I choose to run SQL) must be presented as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <ONE SQL STATEMENT ON A SINGLE LINE>;\n  ```\n  and I will provide only one SQL statement in the first SQL code block. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output. If you want the final answer (after operations), I will then provide:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A and the connection parameters + goal, or Option B confirming installation preferences. I will then prepare and explain the single-line SQL statement to execute next.",
