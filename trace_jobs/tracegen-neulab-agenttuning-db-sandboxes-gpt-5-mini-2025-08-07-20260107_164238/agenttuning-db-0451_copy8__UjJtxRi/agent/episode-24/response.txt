  "analysis": "The mariadb-server installation started in the last step (apt-get install -y mariadb-server) and the terminal captured package selection and download progress. The system has not yet shown completion of the install in the provided output. My goal after installation is to start the database service, create a database named testdb, create a user tester with password testerpass, grant privileges, and verify by listing databases. None of those database-side steps have been completed yet according to the latest output.",
  "plan": "1) Start the MariaDB/MySQL service (try both service mysql and service mariadb). 2) As root (socket auth), run a single-line SQL statement that creates database testdb, creates user 'tester'@'localhost' with password 'testerpass' if not exists, grants all privileges on testdb to that user, and flushes privileges. 3) Verify by listing databases. I will run three shell commands in order: start service, run the mysql -e creation statement, then run mysql -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to confirm testdb exists. Each command is short so I'll use small durations.",
