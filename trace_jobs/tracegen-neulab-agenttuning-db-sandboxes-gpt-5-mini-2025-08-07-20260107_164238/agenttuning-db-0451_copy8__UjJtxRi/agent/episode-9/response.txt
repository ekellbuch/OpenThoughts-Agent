  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL server running locally: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database to query. I previously requested whether you want to (A) connect to a remote MySQL server (requiring host/port/user/password/database) or (B) install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (requiring confirmation and any desired root password or initial DB/user). You have not provided further input.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Provide one of the following:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate if passwordless/SSL/socket auth), and the database name (or say \"list databases\").\n- Also tell me the exact query or the goal (e.g., list tables, count rows, select specific data). I will then (1) explain the single-line SQL I will run and why, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line fenced SQL code block for you to execute with the mysql client using the provided connection details.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want installation, choose MySQL or MariaDB (if you have no preference I'll install MariaDB by default), and provide a root password or say to use socket auth. Optionally give a DB name and a user/password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run apt-get install for the chosen server, initialize/start it, create the requested DB/user, then explain the SQL and provide a single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute locally.\n\nIf you are unsure, tell me the exact question you want answered about the database (for example: \"List all users with last_login before 2024-01-01\" or \"Count rows in table X\"). If a remote DB exists I will craft the SQL for that; otherwise I will guide installing a local server.\n\nWhen you respond, include either the remote connection parameters or confirm installation and preferences. After that I will prepare the one-line SQL statement and explanation as required.",
