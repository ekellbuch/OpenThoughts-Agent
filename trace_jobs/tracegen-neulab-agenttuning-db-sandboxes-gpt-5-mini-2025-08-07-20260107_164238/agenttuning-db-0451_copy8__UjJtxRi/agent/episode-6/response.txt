  "analysis": "You're in a root shell in /app. The MySQL client has been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL server running on this container: no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket. I cannot run any SQL locally until I either connect to a remote MySQL server or install and start a local server here. No SQL has been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Two clear options:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote/external MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate passwordless/SSL/socket auth), and database name (or tell me to list available databases).\n- Optionally indicate which query you want run or ask me to list tables/describe schema. Once you give connection info and the desired action, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, then (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line fenced SQL code block as required. You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server installed. Tell me which server you prefer (MySQL or MariaDB), a root password (or say you prefer socket auth), and any initial database or user to create.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create any requested database/user, and then we can run SQL locally. After initialization I will explain the SQL and provide the single-line SQL to execute.\n\nPlease reply with one of the options and the necessary details. Examples of the information I need for Option A: { \"host\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"port\": 3306, \"user\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"s3cr3t\", \"database\": \"prod\" }. For Option B reply: \"Install MySQL, root password: <pw>, create DB: <name>, create user: <user>/<pw>\" or similar.\n\nNotes about execution policy: when I send a SQL operation it will be exactly one statement in a single fenced SQL code block (one line). You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. If you want me to proceed now, state the option and provide the details and I will prepare the SQL statement and explain it before producing it.",
