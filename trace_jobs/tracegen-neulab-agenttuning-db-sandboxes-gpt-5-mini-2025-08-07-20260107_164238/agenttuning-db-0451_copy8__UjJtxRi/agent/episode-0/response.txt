  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app with no commands run yet (prompt shows root@eeb160092b05:/app#). No MySQL interaction has been attempted. To answer database questions I need to discover whether the mysql client and server are present, whether the server is running, and what credentials (if any) are available. Once I identify a working client and credentials (or the debian-sys-maint credentials), I can connect and run the single-line SQL statements you require. Currently nothing has been accomplished beyond arriving at the shell prompt.",
  "plan": "1) Verify current user and working directory to confirm environment.\n2) List files in the current directory to see any project or credential files.\n3) Check for the mysql client binary and its version.\n4) Look for running mysqld processes to see if a server is running.\n5) Inspect /var/lib/mysql to see if there are database files.\n6) If present, display /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (common place for automated credentials) to find usable credentials.\n7) Report findings so you can ask the specific DB question; after that I will form the single-line SQL to run.\n\nI will run a series of inspection commands to gather this information. Each command is intended to quickly reveal the environment state so we can safely connect to MySQL.",
