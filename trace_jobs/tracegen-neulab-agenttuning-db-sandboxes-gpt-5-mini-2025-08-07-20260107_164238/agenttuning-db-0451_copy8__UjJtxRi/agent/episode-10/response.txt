  "analysis": "You are root in /app. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no socket). Therefore no SQL has been executed yet and there is no reachable database to query from this container without either (A) remote connection details or (B) installing and starting a local database server here.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Provide one of the two options below with the requested details; after you provide them I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, then (2) present exactly one single-line SQL statement in a single fenced SQL code block for you to execute (per your rules).\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide a JSON-like set of connection parameters, for example:\n  { \"option\": \"A\", \"host\": \"1.2.3.4\", \"port\": 3306, \"user\": \"alice\", \"password\": \"s3cr3t\", \"database\": \"prod\" }\n- Also tell me the goal (e.g., \"list tables\", \"count rows in schema.table\", \"select rows matching condition\").\n\nOption B — Install and run a local DB server in this container:\n- Confirm installation and give preferences, for example:\n  { \"option\": \"B\", \"server\": \"mariadb\", \"root_password\": \"pw123\", \"create_db\": \"testdb\", \"create_user\": {\"name\":\"bob\",\"password\":\"pw456\"} }\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create any requested DB/user, and then proceed to run queries locally.\n\nIf you are unsure, tell me the exact question you want answered about the database (for example: \"Count users with status='active' in database appdb\") and whether a remote DB exists. Once you provide either remote connection details or confirm local installation preferences, I will prepare the single-line SQL (with an explanation) for you to run.",
