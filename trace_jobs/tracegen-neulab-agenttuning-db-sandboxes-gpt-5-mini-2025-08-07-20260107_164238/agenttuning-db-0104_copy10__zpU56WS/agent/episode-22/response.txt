  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is running in the container (mysqld started manually, socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) and the mysql client can connect. We inspected the server: SHOW DATABASES returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). SHOW TABLES FROM mysql listed system tables. DESCRIBE mysql.user showed the schema. SELECT from mysql.user revealed three accounts (mariadb.sys@localhost, root@localhost, mysql@localhost). SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost' shows root has ALL PRIVILEGES and can authenticate via unix_socket or mysql_native_password (the stored password appears as 'invalid'). No user-created databases or application data exist yet. All actions so far were read-only inspections; no modifications have been made.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want next. Options you can ask for (each corresponds to a single SQL statement I can run):\n- List databases again: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT ... FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ... LIMIT ...;\n- Show grants for another user: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host';\n- Create a database/table or modify data: provide the exact SQL change you want.\n\nWhen you pick one, I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) if you want me to operate, I will output exactly the required pattern (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by the single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iterating until we reach a final answer. If you are ready to finish and want a final result without further SQL, say so and I will produce 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array.",
