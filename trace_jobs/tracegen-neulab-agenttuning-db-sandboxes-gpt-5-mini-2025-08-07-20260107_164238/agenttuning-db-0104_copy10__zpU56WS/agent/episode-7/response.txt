If you want me to inspect the server first, I can run a single SQL statement such as SHOW DATABASES; to list available databases, or you can tell me which database/table/operation you want. Once you give the question or permit an inspection query, I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, (2) output 'Action: Operation' followed by exactly one SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block for you to execute, (3) parse the returned raw MySQL output you provide and iterate until the final answer is ready, and then (4) output 'Action: Answer' with Final Answer array when sure.",
