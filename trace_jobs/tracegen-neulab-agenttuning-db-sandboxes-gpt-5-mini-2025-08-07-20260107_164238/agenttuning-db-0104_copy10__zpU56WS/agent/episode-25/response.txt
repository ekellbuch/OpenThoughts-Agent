  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container (mysqld was started manually and is reachable at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). We have inspected the server: SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; listed system tables. DESCRIBE mysql.user; showed the user table schema. SELECT from mysql.user; revealed three accounts: mariadb.sys@localhost (password_expired=Y), root@localhost (authentication_string='invalid', plugin=mysql_native_password, password_expired=N), and mysql@localhost (authentication_string='invalid'). SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; showed GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO `root`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING 'invalid' OR unix_socket WITH GRANT OPTION, so the root OS user can manage the server via unix_socket. No user databases or application data exist yet. All actions so far were read-only inspections.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or the single SQL statement you want executed next. Examples of common next steps (each is a single SQL statement I can run):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES; (already done)\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;\n- List user accounts: SELECT User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, password_expired FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for a user: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host';\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table>;\n- Query application data: SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT N;\n- Make changes: CREATE DATABASE ..., CREATE TABLE ..., INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ... (provide exact SQL)\n\nWhen you specify which single SQL statement to run next, I will: 1) explain my understanding and what I expect to get, and 2) output the required operation format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by one SQL statement in a single-line Markdown code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach a final answer. If you are ready to finish without further SQL, say 'done' and I will provide a final answer summary.",
