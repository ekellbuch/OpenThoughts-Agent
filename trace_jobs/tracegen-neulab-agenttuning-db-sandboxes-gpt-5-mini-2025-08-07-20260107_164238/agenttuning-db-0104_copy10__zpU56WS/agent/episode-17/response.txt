  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is running in the container and the mysql client can connect via /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. We previously listed databases (only system schemas) and listed tables in the mysql schema (including the 'user' table). To answer most questions about accounts or privileges we first need the schema of mysql.user so we know which columns are available to query (for example User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, etc.). Nothing has been changed in the database; this will be an inspection-only operation.",
  "plan": "I will run a single inspection SQL statement to show the column definitions of the mysql.user table. This will return rows with columns like Field, Type, Null, Key, Default, Extra which tell us what properties we can query about users (e.g., User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, account_locked, etc.). Per the operation rules, I will run exactly one SQL statement: DESCRIBE mysql.user;. I expect to receive the table schema which I'll parse and then propose the next SQL operation based on your question.",
