  "analysis": "The MariaDB server in the container is running and reachable via the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (mysqld was started manually). We have already performed read-only inspections: SHOW DATABASES; (returned only system schemas), SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; (listed system tables), DESCRIBE mysql.user; (showed the schema), SELECT ... FROM mysql.user; (listed three accounts: mariadb.sys@localhost, root@localhost, mysql@localhost), COUNT(*) on mysql.user (3 rows), and SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; (root has ALL PRIVILEGES and can authenticate via unix_socket or mysql_native_password). There are no user-created databases or application tables visible yet. No destructive changes have been made; all actions were inspections. Currently I do not have a specific question from you to answer with SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or the single SQL inspection/operation you want performed next. To help you choose, common next steps (each is a single SQL statement I can run) are listed below. When you pick one, I will: (1) explain my understanding of the request and the SQL approach, and (2) output exactly the required 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output for). Possible next statements you can request now:\n- SHOW DATABASES; — list databases (already done)\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; — list tables in a database\n- DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; — show a table schema (e.g., DESCRIBE mysql.user; already done)\n- SELECT User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, password_expired FROM mysql.user; — list user accounts and auth info (already done)\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host'; — see privileges for a specific user (we ran for root)\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table>; — row count for a table\n- SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT N; — inspect application data (you must specify db, table, columns/conditions)\n- CREATE DATABASE <name>; or CREATE TABLE ...; or INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ... — make changes (provide exact SQL if you want modifications)\n\nTell me the single SQL statement you want run next (or say 'done' if you want a final answer now).",
