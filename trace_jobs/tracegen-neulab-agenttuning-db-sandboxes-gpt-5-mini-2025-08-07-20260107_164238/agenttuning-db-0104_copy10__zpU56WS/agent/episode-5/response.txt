If you want me to inspect the server first, say so (I can run SHOW DATABASES; or any other single SQL statement). Once you give the question or permit an inspection query, I will explain my approach and either (a) output an 'Action: Operation' with one SQL statement in a single-line Markdown code block for you to execute, or (b) output the final answer if no further SQL is needed.",
