  "analysis": "MariaDB was installed and a mysqld server was started manually in this container. /var/lib/mysql contains a initialized data directory, /run/mysqld was created and owned by mysql, and mysqld is running as PID 1514. A verification query (SELECT VERSION()) returned 10.11.13-MariaDB..., confirming we can connect via the mysql client through /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. Nothing else has been changed in the database yet; no user-supplied question has been received to run further SQL against the server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, query rows from a table, aggregate data, or modify data). When you ask the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and the approach I will take, including what table(s) and columns I expect to use. 2) Decide whether to 'Operate' (run a single SQL statement) or to 'Answer' (commit a final answer if no more SQL is needed). 3) If operating, I will output exactly the required pattern: first a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL statement in a Markdown code block on one line. That SQL will be the only statement executed and I will await the raw MySQL output you return. 4) I will iterate as needed until the question is fully answered, and when finished I will output 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array as specified.",
