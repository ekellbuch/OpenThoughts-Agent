  "analysis": "MariaDB is running and reachable in the container (mysqld started, socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). We ran SHOW DATABASES; and saw only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). We then listed tables in the 'mysql' schema and received a full list including 'user', 'db', 'tables_priv', etc. No user databases or user data have been inspected yet beyond these system tables.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific question you want answered or which inspection/query to run next. Possible next actions (pick one or provide your own):\n- Inspect databases: SHOW DATABASES; (already done)\n- List tables in a specific database (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;)\n- Describe a specific table (e.g., DESCRIBE mysql.user;)\n- Query rows from a table (e.g., SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;)\n- Run an aggregate or filter (e.g., SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user WHERE ...)\n\nWhen you choose, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and 2) either output 'Action: Operation' plus a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block (for you to execute) or, if no further SQL is needed, output 'Action: Answer' with the final answer array.",
