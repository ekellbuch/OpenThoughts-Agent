  "analysis": "The mariadb packages were installed successfully and the mysql client is available (mysql --version shows MariaDB). However, the MariaDB service could not be started by the system init scripts (policy-rc.d denied execution in this container), so there is currently no running mysqld and no socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The next steps are to start a mysqld process manually in this container (create the runtime directory, ensure ownership, then start mysqld in the foreground/background). After the server is running I will verify by running a simple SELECT VERSION() query. Once the server is up I can accept your database question and run SQL statements as you instruct.",
  "plan": "1) Find where the mysqld binary is (or confirm it's in PATH). 2) Inspect /var/lib/mysql to see if the datadir exists and has files. 3) Create the runtime socket directory /run/mysqld and chown it to mysql:mysql so mysqld can create its socket. 4) Start mysqld manually with a specified socket and run it in the background. 5) Wait a short moment for startup, verify the mysqld process is running, then run mysql -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" to confirm connectivity. If the server starts and the version query succeeds, I'll report back and await your SQL question.",
