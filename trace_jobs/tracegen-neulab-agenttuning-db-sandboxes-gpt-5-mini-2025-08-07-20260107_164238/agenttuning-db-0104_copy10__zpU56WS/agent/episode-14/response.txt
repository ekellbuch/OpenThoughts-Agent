The mysql client works and we've already run inspections: SHOW DATABASES; returned system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; returned system tables including the 'user' table. No user-provided question has been given yet, and no further SQL has been executed beyond those inspections.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or which single inspection/query you want me to run next. Pick one of these common next steps (or provide your own):\n- Show databases (already done)\n- List tables in a specific database (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;)\n- Describe a specific table schema (e.g., DESCRIBE mysql.user;)\n- Inspect rows in a table (e.g., SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;)\n- Show grants for a user (e.g., SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';)\n- Create/modify data (please provide the exact desired change)\n\nWhen you choose, I will:\n1) Explain my understanding and the SQL approach I will take.\n2) If you want me to operate, I will output exactly the required pattern: a line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will then parse it and continue iterating until we reach the final answer.  \n3) If we finish and no further SQL is needed, I will output \"Action: Answer\" with Final Answer array as specified.\n\nPlease tell me which of the above (or provide your own) single SQL statement you'd like me to run next.",
