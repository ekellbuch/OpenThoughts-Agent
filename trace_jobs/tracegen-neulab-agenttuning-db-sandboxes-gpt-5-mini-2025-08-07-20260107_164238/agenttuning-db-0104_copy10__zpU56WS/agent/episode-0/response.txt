There is no question from you yet about the database, and I have no view into any MySQL server or database contents. Before I can run SQL statements on a MySQL server I need to confirm MySQL is installed/running and get connection details (user/password or socket). What has been accomplished: nothing yet. What still needs to be done: check MySQL availability on this host, then wait for your specific question about what SQL to run against the database (or connection credentials).",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is available (mysql --version). 2) Check whether a MySQL server process is running (ps aux | grep mysqld). 3) Check whether any MySQL config directory exists (/etc/mysql) to help find socket or defaults. After these checks I'll report results and ask you to provide the question you want answered and any connection credentials (or confirm I should try connecting as root without password).",
