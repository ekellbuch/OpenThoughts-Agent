  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container (mysqld started manually, socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). We have performed read-only inspections: SHOW DATABASES; (only system schemas), SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; (system tables listed), DESCRIBE mysql.user; (user table schema), SELECT from mysql.user (three accounts: mariadb.sys, root, mysql), COUNT(*) on mysql.user (3 rows), and SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost' (root has ALL PRIVILEGES and can auth via unix_socket or mysql_native_password). There are no user-created databases or application tables visible. No data-modifying operations have been performed. I am waiting for the specific database question or the next single SQL statement you want executed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you specify the exact database question or the single inspection/operation you want next. To proceed, tell me one of the following (or provide your own single SQL statement):\n- SHOW DATABASES; — list databases\n- SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; — list tables in a database\n- DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; — show a table schema (e.g., DESCRIBE mysql.user;)\n- SELECT User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, password_expired FROM mysql.user; — list user accounts (we already ran this)\n- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host'; — show privileges for a user (we ran for root)\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table>; — get row count\n- SELECT * FROM <db>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT N; — inspect application data (specify db/table/conditions)\n- CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ... — make changes (provide exact SQL you want executed)\n\nWhen you specify the single SQL statement to run, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and 2) output exactly the required pattern 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block (you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output). I will then parse the output and continue iterating until we reach a final answer, at which point I will output 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array.",
