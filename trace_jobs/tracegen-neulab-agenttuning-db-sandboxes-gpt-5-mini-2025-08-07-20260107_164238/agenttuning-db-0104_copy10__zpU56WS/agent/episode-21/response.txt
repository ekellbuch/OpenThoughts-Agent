  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container (mysqld running, socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). We inspected the server: SHOW DATABASES returned only system schemas, SHOW TABLES FROM mysql listed system tables, DESCRIBE mysql.user returned the user table schema, and SELECT from mysql.user showed three accounts: mariadb.sys@localhost, root@localhost, and mysql@localhost. COUNT(*) confirmed 3 users. SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost' returned: \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO `root`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING 'invalid' OR unix_socket WITH GRANT OPTION\" and a PROXY grant. That means the root account has full privileges and can authenticate via unix_socket (which is why connecting as the OS root user works), or via mysql_native_password using the stored value (which here appears as 'invalid' and may not be usable as a password). No user-created databases or application data exist yet (only system schemas). No data modifications were made; all operations so far were read-only inspections.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your explicit question about the database. Possible next actions you can ask me to perform (each will be a single SQL statement I will return in the required 'Action: Operation' format):\n- List databases again: SHOW DATABASES;\n- Create a new database: CREATE DATABASE dbname; (if you want to add data)\n- List tables in a (new or target) database: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- Describe a table: DESCRIBE dbname.table;\n- List users (already done) or show their grants (we ran for root); to inspect another user run: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host';\n- Query rows from a table: SELECT ... FROM db.table WHERE ... LIMIT ...;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE): provide exact desired change.\n\nWhen you tell me which single SQL statement to run next, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL I will run, and 2) output exactly the required pattern: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, which I will parse and then either continue or, when finished, output 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. If you prefer, I can also perform administrative actions (create users, set passwords, create databases) now that root has full privileges — tell me the exact changes you want.\n\nTell me exactly which single SQL statement to execute next (or say 'done' if you want to finish), and I will prepare the 'Action: Operation' output accordingly.",
