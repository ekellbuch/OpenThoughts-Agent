The MariaDB data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is present. No database-specific queries have been run yet and you have not yet provided the question you want answered or any target table/database names.",
  "plan": "I'll wait for you to state the specific database question or the operation you want performed. When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and the SQL approach. 2) Choose to either 'Operate' (run a single SQL statement) or 'Answer' (return final results). If operating, I will output exactly the required pattern (Action: Operation and a single SQL statement in a Markdown code block on one line). After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse it, explain, and continue iterating until the question is fully answered. If you want me to first inspect the server (for example SHOW DATABASES, SHOW TABLES in a database, or describe a table), tell me which inspection query to run.",
