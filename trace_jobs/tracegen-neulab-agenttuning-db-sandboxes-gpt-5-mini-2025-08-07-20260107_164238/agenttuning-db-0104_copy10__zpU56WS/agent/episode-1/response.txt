  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client or server installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, and no /etc/mysql directory. Nothing has been done to set up a MySQL-compatible server yet. To proceed with SQL operations you'll need a running MySQL/MariaDB server and client available in this environment. I will attempt to install a lightweight MariaDB server and client, start the service, and verify we can connect. If installation fails (network or permission issues), I'll report that so we can choose another approach.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install mariadb-server and mariadb-client (provides mysql client and mysqld server). 3) Start the MariaDB service. 4) Verify the mysql client is available and able to connect by checking version and running a simple SELECT VERSION() query. 5) List the mysqld socket directory to confirm runtime files. If all steps succeed, I'll report back and await your database question so I can run SQL operations. (All commands are run as root in the container.)",
