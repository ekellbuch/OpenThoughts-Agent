We successfully ran inspections: SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; returned many system tables including 'user'. No user-specified question or further SQL has been provided yet, so no application data or user queries have been executed beyond those inspections.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered or which single inspection/query to run next. Common next steps you can ask me to run (each is one SQL statement):\n- Show tables in a particular database: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE mysql.user;\n- Inspect rows in a table: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- Show grants for a user: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Create or modify data: provide the exact SQL change you want.\n\nWhen you pick one, I will (1) explain my understanding of the task and SQL approach, and (2) either output 'Action: Operation' with exactly one SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output for), or, if no SQL is needed, output 'Action: Answer' with the final answer array. Tell me which single SQL statement you'd like me to run next.",
