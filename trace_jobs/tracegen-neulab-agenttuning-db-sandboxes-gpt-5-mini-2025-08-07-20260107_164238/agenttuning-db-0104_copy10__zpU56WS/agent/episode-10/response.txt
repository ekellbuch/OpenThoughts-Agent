There are no user-created databases visible yet. The MariaDB server is running and reachable, and we can run further SQL. Nothing else has been changed in the database beyond the inspection.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction about what to do next. Possible next actions you can ask for (pick one):\n- Inspect a specific database: e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; (to see system tables) or SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema;\n- Query table contents: e.g., SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; (to inspect users) or any other table you name;\n- Create a new database/table and populate it;\n- Run an aggregate or other specific query if you provide the target database/table and the desired condition.\nIf you want me to proceed now to list tables in a specific database, tell me which database (suggestion: mysql). If you want me to inspect available tables across schemas, say so. Once you choose, I will: 1) explain the approach, and 2) output an Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block (per your rules).",
