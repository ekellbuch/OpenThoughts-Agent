No further user-specific queries or modifications have been made because you have not yet specified the database question or which inspection/query to run next.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered or which single inspection/query you'd like me to run next. Pick one of the following (or provide your own); after you pick, I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) either produce an 'Action: Operation' followed by one SQL statement in a single-line Markdown code block (for you to execute and return the raw mysql output), or produce 'Action: Answer' when no SQL is required.\n\nSuggested next actions (each is a single SQL statement I can run):\n- List databases (done): SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE mysql.user;\n- Inspect rows in a table (example): SELECT User, Host, authentication_string FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10;\n- Show grants for a user: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- If you want to query application data, tell me the database and table and the columns/conditions you want.\n\nTell me which single SQL statement above (or your own) you want me to run next. If you want me to proceed now to inspect the mysql.user schema, say \"DESCRIBE mysql.user\" and I will (per your rules) produce the required Action/SQL block for you to execute.",
