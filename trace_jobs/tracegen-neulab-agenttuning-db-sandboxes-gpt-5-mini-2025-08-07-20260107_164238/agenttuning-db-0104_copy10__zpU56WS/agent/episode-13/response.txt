  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is running in the container and the mysql client can connect via socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default/system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; returned many system tables including the 'user' table. No user-created databases or application data have been inspected yet. I currently do not know what question you want answered about the database (e.g., list users, inspect privileges, query a specific table, create or modify data, etc.).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or which inspection/query you want next. To help you decide, here are common next steps you can ask me to run (each is a single SQL statement):\n- Show databases (already done): SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database (already done for mysql): SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE mysql.user; (shows columns in the mysql.user table)\n- Inspect rows in a table: SELECT User, Host, authentication_string FROM mysql.user LIMIT 10; (see user accounts)\n- Show grants for a user: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- If you want to query application data, tell me the target database and table.\n\nWhen you tell me which of the above (or provide your own) to run, I will: (1) explain my understanding of the requested operation and the SQL I'll use, and (2) either produce an 'Action: Operation' with exactly one SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block (for you to execute) or, if no further SQL is needed, produce 'Action: Answer' with the final answer array. Please pick one inspection or query for me to run now.",
