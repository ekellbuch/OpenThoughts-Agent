DESCRIBE mysql.user; returned the schema, which shows columns such as User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, password_expired, etc. No user accounts have been listed yet; to answer common questions about accounts or authentication we should query the mysql.user table for relevant columns (User, Host, authentication_string, plugin, password_expired).",

This helps determine accessible accounts and auth methods. Per your required format, below is the operation and the single-line SQL statement to execute.
