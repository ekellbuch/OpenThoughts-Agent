No database-specific inspection or query has been performed yet; I don't know which databases or tables exist. To proceed I need to inspect the server to see what databases are available before running further queries toward your eventual question.",
  "plan": "I will run a single inspection SQL statement to list all databases so we can decide the next step (which database/table to query). I expect the command to return rows like 'information_schema', 'mysql', 'performance_schema', 'sys' plus any user databases. Following your rules, I will indicate the operation and include the SQL in the required format below, then run it.",
