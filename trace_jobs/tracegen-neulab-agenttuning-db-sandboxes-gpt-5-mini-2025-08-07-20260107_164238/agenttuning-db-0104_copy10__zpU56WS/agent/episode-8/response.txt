  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is installed and running in the container (mysqld started manually, socket at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). The mysql client works (SELECT VERSION() succeeded). The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) exists and contains system schemas. No database-specific queries have been executed because you haven't provided a question or authorized any inspection query yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered (examples: \"list databases\", \"show tables in database X\", \"select rows from table Y where ...\", or a data-modification request). If you want me to inspect the server first, permit one simple inspection query such as SHOW DATABASES;. Once you provide the question or allow an inspection query I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach I will take, (2) choose to 'Operate' or 'Answer', and (3) if operating, output exactly the required pattern: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line Markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iterating until we reach a final answer, at which point I will output 'Action: Answer' with Final Answer array.",
