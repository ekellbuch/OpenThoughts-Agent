If you want me to inspect the server first, tell me which single SQL statement to run (common starters: SHOW DATABASES; or SELECT DATABASE(); or SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;). Once you provide the question or permit an inspection query, I will: 1) Explain my understanding and approach. 2) Output either 'Action: Operation' plus one SQL statement in a single-line Markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output for), or 'Action: Answer' with the final answer array if no SQL is needed.",
