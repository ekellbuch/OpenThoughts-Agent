  "analysis": "We have a running MariaDB server and can run SQL. You previously asked me to inspect mysql.user; the query returned three accounts: 'mariadb.sys'@'localhost' (empty authentication_string, plugin mysql_native_password, password_expired = Y), 'root'@'localhost' (authentication_string = 'invalid', plugin mysql_native_password, password_expired = N), and 'mysql'@'localhost' (authentication_string = 'invalid', plugin mysql_native_password, password_expired = N). There are 3 user rows in mysql.user. To understand what privileges the root account has (so we can determine what operations are possible and whether root can perform administrative tasks), the next logical step is to check the grants for 'root'@'localhost'.",
  "plan": "Run a single SQL statement to show the privileges (grants) for the root@localhost account. I expect output like GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' ... or a more restricted set. Based on the grants we can decide further steps (e.g., list other accounts' grants, inspect specific databases/tables, or perform modifications). Per your rules, I'll execute exactly one SQL statement now to retrieve the grants for root.",
