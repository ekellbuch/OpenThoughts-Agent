  "analysis": "The shell prompt is a root shell in a container (/app). No MySQL-related commands have been run yet. To answer questions that require running SQL, I need to connect to a MySQL server. Common places to find connection info are: mysql client availability, running mysqld process, socket or TCP port (3306), MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql), and Debian's /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which sometimes contains administrative credentials. I will inspect these to determine how to connect. After that I will attempt a connection and run the SQL you request.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether a mysql client is installed and its version. 2) Check for running mysqld processes and listening TCP sockets (port 3306). 3) List MySQL data and config directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql). 4) If present, show /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which may contain administrative credentials we can use to connect. 5) Based on results, attempt to connect with mysql client (I will wait for your next prompt to run the actual SQL). Each command is short and non-blocking.",
