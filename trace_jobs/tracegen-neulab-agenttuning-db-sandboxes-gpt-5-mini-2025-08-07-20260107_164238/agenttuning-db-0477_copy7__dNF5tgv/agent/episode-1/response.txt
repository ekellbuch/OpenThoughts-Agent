  "analysis": "Current container has no MySQL client or server installed. mysql command is not found, there is no /var/lib/mysql or /etc/mysql, and ss and mysqld processes are absent. Therefore we cannot run any SQL yet from this environment. To be able to execute SQL statements you will provide later, I need to install a MySQL-compatible client in this container so I can connect to a MySQL server (local or remote) when you give connection details or when one becomes available.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL-compatible client (default-mysql-client) so the mysql command is available. 3) Verify installation by checking mysql --version and which mysql. After this, I'll be ready to connect to a MySQL server and run the SQL statement you provide. If a server is required locally, we can install mariadb-server or mysql-server later, but first I'll just install the client.",
