  "analysis": "You're in a minimal container at /app. I've already searched the filesystem and runtime for any MySQL resources and found none: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, or /run/mysqld, no my.cnf/debian.cnf, no mysqld process, no MYSQL_* env vars, and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files in common locations. Therefore there is currently no local MySQL server, no client to talk to a remote server, and no database dump/file to operate on inside this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you choose one of the following and provide the requested info or permission. Pick exactly one option and reply; after you confirm I will run the precise commands or produce the single SQL statement per your protocol.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details now (best if you have an external DB):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password (or client certificate details). After you supply credentials I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run and return the output.\n\nOption B — Place a database/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and type:\n  - e.g., /app/dump.sql (MySQL dump) or /app/db.sqlite (SQLite). If it's SQLite I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported/queried, the mysql client will be needed (see Option C).\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in the container (recommended if you have remote DB credentials):\n  - If you allow, I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then verify with mysql --version. After installation you provide connection details and I will produce the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (more invasive):\n  - If you allow, I'll outline exact install/start steps (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to run mariadbd without systemd) before proceeding. This requires additional initialization and password setup.\n\nIf you choose Option A, include the credentials now and I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the exact format you required. If you pick Option B, place the file and tell me its path and type. If you pick Option C or D, explicitly permit package installation and I will run the install commands and continue.\n\nWhich single option do you choose? Provide any necessary credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages.",
