  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app and I have already searched for any MySQL-related resources. Findings: no mysql client installed, no /etc/mysql, no /var/lib/mysql, no /run/mysqld, no my.cnf/debian.cnf, no mysqld process, no MYSQL_* environment variables, and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files in common locations. In short, there is currently no MySQL server or client available inside this environment and no database dump/file to operate on.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until one of the following is provided or permitted. Please choose exactly one option and confirm; I will then execute the corresponding commands and continue the SQL interaction according to your rules.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client certs). After you give credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the output back; I will analyze it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Place a database/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type\n- Example: /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite. If it's SQLite I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried I will need the mysql client installed (see Option C). After you provide the file path I will give the next inspection or import command (one SQL per round as required).\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container (recommended if you have remote DB credentials)\n- If you allow installation I will run these commands in order:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation, provide the connection info and I will produce the first SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL) for you to run.\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container\n- This requires explicit permission. If you allow, I will outline and then run the install/start commands (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to initialize and run mariadbd without systemd). Note this is more invasive and may require additional steps to set a root password and initialize databases.\n\nPlease reply with which single option you choose and provide any required credentials, file paths, or explicit permission to install packages. I will not change the environment or install packages without your explicit approval.",
