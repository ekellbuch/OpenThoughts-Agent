  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app. Previous checks show there is no MySQL server or client present: /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf was found; no mysqld process is running; no MYSQL_* environment variables; no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were discovered in common locations; and the mysql client is not installed. Therefore there is currently no database to run SQL against from within this container and I cannot produce or run SQL operations until a database or client is available or you provide remote connection details.",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state without your explicit permission. Please choose one of the following options so I can continue. For each option I list exactly the commands I will run once you confirm:\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details\n- Provide host (or socket), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client certs). After you give credentials I will output exactly one SQL statement per your required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the mysql output, and I will continue.\n\nOption B — Place a DB/dump file in the container\n- Put the file under /app (for example /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite) and tell me the exact path and file type. If it's sqlite I can query it (may request installing sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried, I will need the mysql client installed (see Option C).\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client here (recommended if you have remote DB credentials)\n- If you allow installation I will run these commands in order:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n  After installation, provide the connection info and I will produce the first SQL statement (Action: Operation and one-line SQL in a code block) for you to run.\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server\n- This requires explicit permission. If you allow, I will outline the exact commands to install mariadb-server and start it without systemd (we'll need to handle initialization and root password). I will not run these until you approve.\n\nPlease reply with the option you choose and supply any necessary credentials or file paths and explicit permission to install packages if needed. I will then proceed and either (A) output the single SQL statement you must run (if you provided credentials or a database file and the client is available), or (B) run the installation commands you authorize and then request the connection info.",
