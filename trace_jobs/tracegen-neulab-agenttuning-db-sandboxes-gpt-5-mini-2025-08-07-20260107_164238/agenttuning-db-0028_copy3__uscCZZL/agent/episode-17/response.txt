  "analysis": "You are in a minimal container at /app. I have already searched for any MySQL resources and found none: mysql client is not installed; /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf found; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were discovered in common locations. Therefore there is currently no MySQL server or client available inside this environment and no database dump/file to operate on.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide one of the following or give explicit permission to install software. Pick exactly one option and reply; I will then proceed and (when appropriate) produce the single SQL statement per your protocol.\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client certs). After you provide credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run. You will paste back the mysql output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Place a database/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type\n- Example: /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite. If it's SQLite I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried, the mysql client will be needed (see Option 3). After you provide the file path I will give the next inspection or query step.\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install the mysql client in this container\n- If you allow installation I will run these commands to install the client and then request connection details:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation, provide connection info and I will produce the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption 4 — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container\n- This requires explicit permission. If allowed I will outline exact install/start commands (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to run mariadbd without systemd) before proceeding. Note: initialization and password setup will be required.\n\nTell me which single option you choose and provide any required credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages. If you choose Option 1 and provide credentials now, I will immediately output the first SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
