  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app. Prior checks found no MySQL server, no mysql client, no MySQL config or socket files, and no database dumps or DB files in usual locations. No mysqld process is running and no MYSQL-related environment variables exist. Nothing new has changed since the last inspection.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until there is a database to connect to or a client to use. Please choose one of these options so I can proceed:\n\n1) Provide remote MySQL connection details (host, port if non-default, username, password or client cert info). If you provide credentials I will produce a single SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and paste the output back for me to analyze and continue.\n\n2) Upload or place a database/dump file into the container and tell me the path (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite). Tell me the file type. If needed I will request permission to install a small client (mysql-client or sqlite3) to query it.\n\n3) Permit me to install the mysql client in the container so I can connect to a remote DB or import a local dump. If you allow installation I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then request connection details and produce the first SQL operation. Confirm if you allow this.\n\n4) Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (requires explicit permission). If you choose this I will outline the exact install/start commands before running them.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option and any required credentials, file paths, or explicit permission to install packages. Once you respond I will either (A) produce the first SQL statement for you to run (if you provided credentials or a database file and the client is available), or (B) run the install commands you authorized and then proceed.",
