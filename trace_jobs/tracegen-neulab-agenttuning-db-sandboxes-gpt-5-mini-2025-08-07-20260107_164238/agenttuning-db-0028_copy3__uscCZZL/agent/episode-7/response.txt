  "analysis": "Container is idle at /app. I previously checked for any MySQL server, client, sockets, configuration files, or database dumps and found none: mysql client is not installed, no /etc/mysql, no /var/lib/mysql, no /run/mysqld, no my.cnf, no mysqld process, and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files in common locations. Therefore there is currently no database to run SQL against from within this container.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick exactly one of these options and reply so I can act accordingly.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details:\n- Provide host (or socket path), port (optional if not 3306), username, and password (or client certs). After you supply credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and paste the MySQL output here; I will then analyze and produce the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Place a database/dump file into the container:\n- Upload or put the file under /app (for example /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite) and tell me the exact path and file type. If it is a SQLite file I can query it (may need to install sqlite3). If it is a MySQL dump (.sql) and you want it queried/imported, I will need the mysql client installed (see Option C). After you provide the file I will produce the next command to inspect or query it.\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container:\n- If you allow installation I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n- Then I will confirm mysql --version and, after you provide connection credentials, produce the first SQL operation (one statement) for you to execute.\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container:\n- This requires explicit permission. If you allow it I will outline the exact install/start commands (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to start it without systemd) before running them.\n\nWhat I will not do without explicit permission: install packages or start services. Once you pick an option and provide any required credentials or file paths and installation permission if needed, I will proceed. If you choose Option A and provide credentials now, I will immediately output the first SQL statement in the exact format you requested (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block).",
