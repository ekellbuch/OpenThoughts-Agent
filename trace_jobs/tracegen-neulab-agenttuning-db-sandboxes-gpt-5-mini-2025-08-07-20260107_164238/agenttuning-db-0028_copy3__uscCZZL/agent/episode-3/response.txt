  "analysis": "We are in a minimal container at /app. There is no MySQL server, no mysql client, no MySQL config files, no database files or SQL dumps found in common locations, and no running mysqld process. Nothing has been executed since the last checks. To run SQL against a database we need either connection credentials to a remote MySQL instance, a database/dump file present in the container, or permission to install and run a client (or server) here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice of how to proceed. Pick one of the following and I will act accordingly:\n\n1) Provide remote MySQL connection details (host, port, username, password, or socket). If you provide credentials I will produce a single SQL statement per your rules (Action: Operation with one SQL code block) for you to run and return the output. \n\n2) Place an existing DB/dump file inside the container and tell me the path (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite). If it's a sqlite file I can query it with sqlite3 (if present) or I can install sqlite3. If it's a .sql and you want me to import it I can install the mysql client (with your permission) and proceed.\n\n3) Allow me to install the mysql client in this container so I can connect to a remote DB you provide, or to import a local dump. If you approve, I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then verify mysql --version. After that I will request the connection info and then produce the first SQL operation (single statement) for you to execute.\n\n4) Allow me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (requires more setup and permission). If you choose this I will outline the exact install and startup commands before running them.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any needed credentials or file paths, and whether I have permission to install packages here. Once you confirm, I will proceed and produce the first SQL statement or run the agreed install commands.",
