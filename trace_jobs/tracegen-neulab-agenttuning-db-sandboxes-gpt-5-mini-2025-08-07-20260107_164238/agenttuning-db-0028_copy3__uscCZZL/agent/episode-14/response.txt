  "analysis": "Container /app is empty and idle. I previously searched the filesystem and runtime and found no MySQL server, no mysql client, no MySQL config or socket files, no db dumps (.sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz), and no running mysqld process. The mysql client binary is not installed. Therefore there is currently no accessible MySQL instance or SQL files to operate on from inside this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until one of the following is provided or permitted: (A) remote MySQL connection details (host, port, username, password or client certs), (B) a database/dump file placed into the container with its path and type, or (C) explicit permission to install the mysql client (or to install & start a local MariaDB server). Please choose exactly one option. If you permit installation of the mysql client I will run the commands listed below. If you provide remote credentials I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the required format for you to execute and return the output.\n\nIf you choose installation (Option C), I will run these commands in order to install the client and confirm it is available:\n1) apt-get update\n2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n3) mysql --version\n\nIf you choose to provide remote credentials (Option A), please supply: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or client cert info). After you provide credentials I will output exactly one SQL statement per your protocol (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block).\n\nIf you place a DB/dump file in the container (Option B), tell me the exact path and file type (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite). I will then request permission to install a relevant client if needed or proceed to inspect/query the file.",
