  "analysis": "You are in a minimal container at /app. I have already searched the filesystem and runtime for any MySQL resources and found none: mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found); /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf/debian.cnf; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were discovered in common locations. In short, there is currently no MySQL server, no mysql client, and no database dump/file inside this container to operate on. Nothing new has changed since the last checks.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose exactly one option. Please reply with ONE of these options (A, B, C, or D) and any required data or explicit permission; after you reply I will run the precise commands and continue.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- Provide host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client cert info). After you provide credentials I will output exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run and return the output.\n\nOption B — Place a DB/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and type\n- Example: /app/dump.sql (MySQL dump) or /app/db.sqlite (SQLite). Tell me the path and file type. If SQLite I may request permission to install sqlite3; if MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried I will need the mysql client (Option C).\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container\n- If you explicitly allow package installation I will run these commands:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n  After installation you provide connection credentials and I will produce the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block).\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container\n- This is more invasive and requires explicit permission. If allowed I will outline steps (apt-get install mariadb-server, initialize DB, and run mariadbd manually) before proceeding.\n\nTell me which single option you choose and include any required credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages. I will not modify the environment or install packages without your explicit approval.",
