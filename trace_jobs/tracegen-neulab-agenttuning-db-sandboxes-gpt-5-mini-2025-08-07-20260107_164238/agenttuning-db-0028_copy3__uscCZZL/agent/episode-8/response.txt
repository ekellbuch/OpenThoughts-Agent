  "analysis": "You are in a minimal container at /app. I have already checked for MySQL server/client/config/dumps and found none: /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; mysql client is not installed; no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were found in common locations. The environment currently has no accessible MySQL instance or SQL files to operate on.",
  "plan": "I cannot execute SQL until there is a database to connect to or a client to run against a local dump. Choose one of the following options and I will proceed exactly as described:\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote MySQL connection details (host, port if not 3306, username, password or client certs):\n- After you provide credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block) for you to run. You will paste the MySQL output back and I will analyze it and produce the next statement or the final answer.\n\nOption 2 — Place a DB/dump file into the container and tell me its path (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite):\n- If it's SQLite I can query it (may require installing sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump (.sql) and you want me to query/import it, I will need the mysql client installed (see Option 3). After you provide the file path I will give the single SQL or inspection command required.\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install the mysql client in this container (I will not install without permission):\n- If allowed I will run these commands to install the client and then request connection details:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation you provide connection credentials, and I will produce the first SQL statement in the required format.\n\nOption 4 — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server (requires explicit permission):\n- If allowed I will outline the exact install/start steps (apt-get install mariadb-server, then start mariadbd/mysqld manually) before running them.\n\nNotes about the interaction flow:\n- When performing an Operation, I will output exactly: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in one SQL code block. You will run only the first SQL code block I give and return the output. I will then analyze and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n- When you want me to finish and return the final result, I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]. I will only output that when I am sure of the result.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary credentials, file paths, or explicit permission to install packages. Once you reply I will proceed accordingly and, if appropriate, produce the single SQL statement you must run.",
