  "analysis": "Current container state: /app is empty and idle. I have already searched for MySQL server/client/config/dumps and found none: mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found); /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf found; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* env vars; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files located in common places. Therefore there is currently no MySQL server, no client, and no database dump/file inside this container to operate on. Nothing new has changed since the last checks.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed with SQL operations until you choose exactly one of these mutually exclusive options. Please reply with ONE option (A, B, C, or D) and include any required data or explicit permission as described. After you reply I will perform the specified actions and produce the single SQL statement(s) per your execution protocol.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client cert details).\n- After you provide credentials I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the mysql output back; I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption B — Place a database/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type\n- Example: /app/dump.sql (MySQL dump) or /app/db.sqlite (SQLite).\n- Tell me the path and file type. If SQLite, I may ask permission to install sqlite3; if MySQL dump, importing/querying requires the mysql client (see Option C).\n- After you provide the file I will give the next inspection/query command.\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container\n- If you explicitly allow package installation I will run:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation you provide connection credentials and I will produce the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block).\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container\n- This is more invasive and requires explicit permission. If allowed, I will outline exact install/start steps (apt-get install mariadb-server, initialization, and how to run mariadbd without systemd) before proceeding. After the server is running I can create/inspect databases per your requests.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option and supply any required credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages. If you choose Option A, include credentials now and I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
