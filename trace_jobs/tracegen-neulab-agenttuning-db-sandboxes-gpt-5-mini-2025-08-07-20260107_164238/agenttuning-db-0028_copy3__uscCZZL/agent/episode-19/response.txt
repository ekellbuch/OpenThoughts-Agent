  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app. Previous checks show no MySQL client or server and no database files: mysql client is not installed; /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf; no mysqld process; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were found in common locations. Therefore there is currently no local MySQL instance or client available to run SQL from inside this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you (choose exactly one):\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details (host, port if non-default, username, password or client certs).\n- If you provide credentials now I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute and return the output.\n\nOption B — Upload/place a database or SQL dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite).\n- If it's a SQLite file I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried I will need the mysql client installed (see Option C).\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in the container so I can connect to a remote DB or import a dump.\n- If you allow installation I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then mysql --version. After that you provide connection credentials and I will output the first SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block).\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (requires explicit permission and is more invasive).\n- If you allow I will outline the exact install and startup commands before running them.\n\nTell me which single option you choose and provide any required credentials or file paths and explicit permission to install packages if needed. If you choose Option A and provide credentials now I will immediately output the first SQL statement in the exact format you specified.",
