  "analysis": "You are in a minimal container at /app. I have already searched for any MySQL-related resources and found none: mysql client is not installed; /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf/debian.cnf found; no running mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files in common locations. Therefore there is currently no local MySQL server, no mysql client, and no database dump or file to operate on from inside this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until one of these is provided or permitted. Please choose exactly one option and confirm; I will then perform the precise commands listed for that option.\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or client certs).\n- Once you provide credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement per your interaction rules in the form: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block. You will run that SQL and paste the mysql output here; I will analyze it and produce the next single-line SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption 2 — Place a database/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type\n- Example: /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite. If it's SQLite I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried I will need the mysql client installed (see Option 3).\n- After you provide the file path I will give the next inspection or query command (one SQL per round as required by your protocol).\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container (recommended if you have remote DB credentials)\n- If you allow installation I will run these commands to install the client and then request connection details:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation you provide connection info and I will produce the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with one-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption 4 — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (more invasive)\n- This requires explicit permission. If you allow, I will outline exact install/start steps before proceeding (apt-get install mariadb-server, initialization, and how to run mariadbd without systemd). Note this requires additional setup for root password and DB initialization.\n\nReply with one chosen option and any required data (credentials, file path) or explicit permission to install packages. If you choose Option 1 and provide credentials now, I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the exact format you requested. If you permit installation (Option 3 or 4), say so and I will run the install commands.",
