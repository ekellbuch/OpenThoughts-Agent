  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app. I have already searched for MySQL server/client/config/dumps and found none: mysql client is not installed; /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf found; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were discovered in common locations. Therefore there is currently no MySQL server, no mysql client, and no database dump/file inside this container to operate on from here.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you either (A) provide remote MySQL connection details, (B) place a database/dump file into the container and tell me its path/type, (C) explicitly permit me to install the mysql client here, or (D) explicitly permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server. Please choose exactly one option and reply. For convenience, here are the exact commands I will run for each option once you confirm:\n\n- Option A (you provide remote credentials): I will not run any local commands. You supply host (or socket), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client cert info). After that I will produce one SQL statement per your protocol (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\n- Option B (you place a DB/dump file in container): After you put the file (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite) and tell me the path/type, I'll inspect it. Example commands I would run to inspect:\n  - ls -la /app/yourfile\n  - file /app/yourfile\n  - If SQLite and sqlite3 present: sqlite3 /app/yourfile \".tables\"\n  If sqlite3 is not present I will request permission to install it.\n\n- Option C (permit installing mysql client): With your explicit permission I will run these commands to install the client and then ask for connection info:\n  - apt-get update\n  - apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  - mysql --version\n  After installation you supply credentials and I will output the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block).\n\n- Option D (permit installing & starting a local server): This is more invasive and requires explicit permission. If approved I will outline steps (apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server; initialize and start mariadbd manually) before running them.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (A, B, C, or D). If you choose A, include credentials now and I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the required format. If you choose B, place the file and tell me the exact path and type. If you choose C or D, explicitly permit package installation and I will run the install commands described above.",
