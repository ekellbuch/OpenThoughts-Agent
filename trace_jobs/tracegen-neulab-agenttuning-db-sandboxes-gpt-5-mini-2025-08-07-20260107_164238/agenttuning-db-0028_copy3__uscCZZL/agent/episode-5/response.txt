  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app. I previously checked for a MySQL server, client, sockets, config files, and database dumps and found none: /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf found; no mysqld process; mysql client is not installed; no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files discovered in common locations. Nothing further has been executed since those checks.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested data or permission; I will then act accordingly and—when necessary—produce the single SQL statement per your rules for you to run:\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote MySQL connection details: host (or socket path), port (optional), username, and password (or path to client certs). If you give credentials, I will produce the first SQL operation formatted exactly as you required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and paste the output back.\n\nOption 2 — Place a database/dump file in the container and tell me its path (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite). Tell me the file type. If needed I will request permission to install a small client (mysql-client or sqlite3) and then proceed to query the file.\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install a MySQL client in the container (I will not install without explicit permission). If allowed, I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then request connection info and produce the first SQL operation.\n\nOption 4 — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server (requires explicit permission). If you choose this I will outline the exact install/start steps for approval before running them.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide any needed credentials or file path and explicit permission for installation if required. If you provide remote credentials, include them now and I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the exact format you specified.",
