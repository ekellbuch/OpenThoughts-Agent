  "analysis": "The container is minimal and idle at /app. There is no MySQL server, no mysql client, no MySQL config or socket files, no database dumps (.sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz) in common locations, and no running mysqld process. Nothing new has been done since the last checks. To run SQL I need either remote connection credentials, a database/dump file present in the container, or permission to install a client (or a server) here.",
  "plan": "I will not run any changes without your instruction. Choose one of these options and I will proceed exactly as described:\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details (host, port, username, password or socket):\n- After you provide credentials I will produce one SQL statement per your rules in the form: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block. You will run that statement and paste the MySQL output back; I will then interpret it and provide the next single SQL statement or final answer.\n\nOption B — Place a DB/dump file in the container and tell me the path (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite):\n- If it's a sqlite file I can query it (I may need to install sqlite3 if absent, with your permission). If it's a MySQL dump (.sql) and you want me to query or import it, I will need the mysql client installed (ask below).\n\nOption C — Allow me to install the MySQL client here so I can connect to a remote DB or import a local dump (I will not install without permission). If you approve, I will run:\n- apt-get update\n- apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\nThen I'll confirm mysql --version and request connection details, then produce the first SQL operation (one statement) for you to run.\n\nOption D — Allow me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in this container (requires more setup and explicit permission). If you choose this I will outline exact install/start commands before running them.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide any needed credentials/file paths and whether I have permission to install packages. If you provide remote credentials, include them now and I will produce the first SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.",
