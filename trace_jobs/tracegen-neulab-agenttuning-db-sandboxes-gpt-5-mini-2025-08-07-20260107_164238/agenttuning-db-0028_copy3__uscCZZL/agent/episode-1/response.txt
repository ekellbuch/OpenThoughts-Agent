  "analysis": "From the previous commands: current working directory is /app (almost empty). There is no /etc/mysql, no /var/lib/mysql, no /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, no mysqld process running, no MYSQL-related environment variables, and the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). In short: there is no MySQL server or client visible in the usual locations, and no credentials/config files were found so far. To proceed I need either (A) a mysql client and connection info (host, port, user, password) to connect to a remote server, (B) a local MySQL server/socket to connect to, or (C) a SQL dump / database file present on disk that I can query with a local client. None of those have been found yet.",
  "plan": "Search the filesystem for any MySQL-related sockets, config files, database files, or SQL dumps and check common runtime locations. Specifically: 1) check /run and /var/run for a mysqld socket directory; 2) list /tmp in case someone placed a socket or dump there; 3) search common locations (/app, /home, /tmp, /var, /opt) for files with extensions .sql, .db, .sqlite, .sql.gz; 4) search for directories named mysql or mysqld within a limited depth to avoid a long full-system scan; 5) check whether mysqld binary exists in PATH; 6) search common locations for my.cnf or .my.cnf files that could contain connection info. If we find a dump or config with credentials, we'll use that info for the next step (connect or run SQL). If nothing is found, I'll ask you to provide connection details or permission to install a client.",
