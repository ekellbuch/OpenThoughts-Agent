  "analysis": "The container is at /app and idle. I searched the filesystem and runtime for MySQL resources and found none: mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found); /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files in common locations. Therefore there is currently no local MySQL server, no client, and no database dump/file to operate on from inside this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose exactly one of these options and (when required) provide credentials, a file path, or explicit permission to install packages. Please reply with one option and any required data:\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote MySQL connection details now: supply host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client cert info). If you provide credentials I will output one SQL statement in the required format for you to run and return the output.\n\nOption 2 — Place a DB/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and type (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite). I will then request permission to install a client if needed and proceed.\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container: I will run apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then mysql --version. After that provide connection details and I will produce the first SQL statement.\n\nOption 4 — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container: I will outline the install/start steps and require explicit approval before proceeding.\n\nTell me which single option you choose and include any needed credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages. Once you reply I will proceed accordingly and (when applicable) produce the single SQL statement you must run.",
