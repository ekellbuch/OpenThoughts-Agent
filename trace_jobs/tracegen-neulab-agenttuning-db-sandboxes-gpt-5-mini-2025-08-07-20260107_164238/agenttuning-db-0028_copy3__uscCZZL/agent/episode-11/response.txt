  "analysis": "You're in a minimal container at /app. I have already checked for a MySQL server, client, sockets, configuration files, and database dumps and found none: /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf found; no mysqld process running; no MYSQL_* environment variables; mysql client is not installed; no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were found in common locations. Therefore there is currently no accessible MySQL instance or SQL files to operate on from inside this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until one of the following is provided or permitted. Pick exactly one option and reply; after you confirm I will run the specific commands listed for that option and continue the SQL interaction according to your rules.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- You provide: host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, and password (or client certs). After you provide credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the form you required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the output; I will analyze it and produce the next SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Place a DB/dump file in the container and tell me the path and type\n- If you put a file (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite) tell me the exact path and file type. If it's SQLite I can query it (may need to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried, the mysql client will be needed (see Option C). After you tell me the path I will provide the next inspection or query step.\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container (recommended if you have remote DB credentials)\n- If you allow installation I will run these commands in order to install the client and then request connection details:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation, provide the connection info and I will output the first SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run.\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container\n- This requires explicit permission. If allowed I will first outline the exact install/start commands (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to run mariadbd without systemd) before proceeding. Note: initialization and root password handling will be required.\n\nFor each option above I will not proceed until you explicitly choose and (when required) grant permission to install packages or provide credentials/file paths. After you choose and I perform the agreed preparatory steps, I will follow your interaction protocol: produce exactly one SQL statement per round (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block). You will run only the first SQL code block I provide and paste the output back for me to analyze and continue.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and include any required credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages. If you choose Option A and provide credentials now, I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the required format.",
