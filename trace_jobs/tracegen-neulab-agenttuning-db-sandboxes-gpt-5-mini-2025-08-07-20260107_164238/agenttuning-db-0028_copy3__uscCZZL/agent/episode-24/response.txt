  "analysis": "You're in a minimal container at /app. I've already searched for MySQL resources and found none: mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found); /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, and /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files were found in common locations. In short, there is currently no MySQL server, no mysql client, and no database dump/file inside this container to operate on.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you choose one of these mutually exclusive options. Pick exactly one and reply; after you confirm I will run the precise commands described below.\n\nOption 1 — Provide remote MySQL connection details now (recommended if you have an external DB):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or client cert info).\n  - After you provide credentials I will produce exactly one SQL statement per your protocol (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run and return the output.\n\nOption 2 — Place a DB/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type:\n  - Example: /app/dump.sql (MySQL dump) or /app/db.sqlite (SQLite).\n  - If it's SQLite I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried, the mysql client will be needed (see Option 3).\n\nOption 3 — Permit me to install the mysql client in this container (required to connect to remote MySQL or import a MySQL dump):\n  - If you allow installation I will run these commands (I will not run them without your explicit permission):\n    1) apt-get update\n    2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n    3) mysql --version\n  - After installation you provide connection credentials and I will produce the first SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption 4 — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container (more invasive):\n  - If you allow, I will outline exact install/start commands before running them (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to initialize and run mariadbd without systemd). This requires additional initialization and password setup.\n\nIf you choose Option 1, include credentials now and I will immediately output the first SQL statement in the exact format you requested. If you choose Option 2, put the file in the container and tell me its path and type. If you choose Option 3 or 4, explicitly permit package installation and I will run the install steps and continue. I will perform no installs or changes without your explicit instruction.",
