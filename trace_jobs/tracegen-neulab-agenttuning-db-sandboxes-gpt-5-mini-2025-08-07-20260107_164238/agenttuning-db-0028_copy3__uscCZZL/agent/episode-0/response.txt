  "analysis": "We are at a root shell in /app with no job control messages. No commands have been run yet in this session. To operate a MySQL database I need to find whether a MySQL server is present, where its socket/data/configuration files are, and any usable credentials (for example in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf or environment variables). Currently nothing has been accomplished toward locating the MySQL server or credentials.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect current directory and top-level filesystem locations for MySQL config and data. 2) Check common MySQL configuration files for credentials (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf). 3) Check running processes to see if mysqld is active and identify its socket. 4) Check environment variables for any MYSQL_* settings. 5) Check whether the mysql client is available. Based on the outputs I'll choose the appropriate connect command or extract credentials. I will run one command at a time and inspect results.",
