  "analysis": "The container is idle at /app. Previous checks found no MySQL server, no mysql client, no MySQL configuration files, no sockets, and no database dumps or DB files in common locations. Specifically: mysql client is not installed; /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf/debian.cnf found; no mysqld process running; and no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files discovered. Therefore there is currently no local database to query from inside this container and no client to connect with.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide one of the following or explicitly permit installing software. Pick exactly one option and reply; I will then run the precise commands listed below for that option and continue the SQL interaction per your protocol.\n\nOption A — Provide remote MySQL connection details now\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or client cert info). After you supply credentials I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and paste the MySQL output back; I will analyze it and produce the next one-line SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Place a DB/dump file into the container and tell me the exact path and file type\n- Example: /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite. If it's SQLite I can query it (may request permission to install sqlite3). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried, I will need the mysql client installed (see Option C). After you provide the file path I will give the next inspection or import command.\n\nOption C — Permit me to install the MySQL client in this container (recommended if you have remote DB credentials)\n- If you allow installation I will run these commands to install the client and then request connection details:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  3) mysql --version\n- After installation you provide connection credentials and I will produce the first SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL) for you to execute.\n\nOption D — Permit me to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server in the container\n- This requires explicit permission. If you allow, I will outline exact install/start commands (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to run mariadbd without systemd) before proceeding. Note: initialization and root password handling will be required.\n\nWhen you choose an option, please also indicate whether you permit installing packages. If you choose Option A, provide credentials now and I will immediately produce the first SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
