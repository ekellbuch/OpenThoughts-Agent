  "analysis": "You're in a minimal container at /app. I have already checked for a MySQL server, client, sockets, config files, and database dumps and found none: /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql, /run/mysqld do not exist; no my.cnf or debian.cnf found; no mysqld process; no MYSQL_* environment variables; mysql client not installed; no .sql/.db/.sqlite/.sql.gz files found in common locations. Therefore there is currently no database available here to run SQL against and no client to connect with.",
  "plan": "I cannot execute SQL until one of these is provided: (A) remote MySQL connection details (host, port if non-default, username, password or client certs), (B) a database/dump file placed into the container with its path and type (e.g., /app/dump.sql or /app/db.sqlite), or (C) explicit permission to install a MySQL client (or to install and start a local MariaDB/MySQL server). Please choose exactly one option and provide any required data or permission. What I'll do for each option once you confirm:\n\nOption A — You provide remote credentials:\n- You must supply host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or client certs). After you supply them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to run. You will paste the resulting output back, and I will analyze it and provide the next one-line SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption B — You place a DB/dump file in the container and tell me the path/type:\n- If it's SQLite I can query it (may ask to install sqlite3 with permission). If it's a MySQL dump and you want it imported or queried I will need the mysql client installed (see Option C). After you provide the file path I will give the next command or produce the first SQL operation according to your rules.\n\nOption C — You permit installation of a MySQL client here:\n- With permission I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then confirm mysql --version. After that, provide connection credentials and I will produce the first SQL operation (Action: Operation with one-line SQL) for you to execute.\n\nOption D — You permit installation and start of a local MariaDB/MySQL server:\n- This requires explicit permission. If allowed I will outline exact install and startup commands (apt-get install mariadb-server and how to run it without systemd) before proceeding.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide any required credentials, file path, or explicit permission to install packages. Once you respond I will proceed and (when applicable) output the single SQL statement in the exact format you specified for you to execute.",
