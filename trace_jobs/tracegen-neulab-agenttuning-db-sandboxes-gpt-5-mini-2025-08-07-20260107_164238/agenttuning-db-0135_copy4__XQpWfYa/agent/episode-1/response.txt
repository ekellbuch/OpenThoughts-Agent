  "analysis": "So far I've checked for a MySQL client and server: mysql command is not found, no mysqld process is running, and common config/data dirs (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) are absent. That means there's currently no MySQL server or client available in this container, or they are installed in nonstandard locations. To proceed we must either locate an existing MySQL installation/socket/credentials elsewhere in the filesystem or install a MySQL/MariaDB client here and connect to a remote MySQL server (if you provide connection info).",
  "plan": "1) Search the environment for hints of MySQL-related settings (env vars). 2) Inspect the working directory /app to see if any DB-related files or connection info exist. 3) Look for any MySQL sockets or runtime dirs (/var/run/mysqld, /tmp). 4) Try to locate any mysql/mariadb binaries in common system paths. 5) Check package manager and installed packages to see if a client/server package is present but not on PATH. Based on findings, next steps will be either to install a client or to use found credentials/socket to connect. Expected outcomes: find credentials or binaries, or conclude that installation is required.",
