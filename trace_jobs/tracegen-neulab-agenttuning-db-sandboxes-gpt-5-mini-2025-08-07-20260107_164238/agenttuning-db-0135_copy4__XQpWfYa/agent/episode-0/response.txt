  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside a container. No commands have been run yet in this session (prompt shown). The task context says you'll ask a question about a MySQL database and I should help operate it with SQL. Before I can run SQL statements against MySQL I need to find a MySQL client and/or server, locate the socket or credentials (root password or debian-sys-maint credentials), and confirm the database files or running mysqld process. Currently nothing has been inspected, so we must examine the container for MySQL binaries, config, running process, and possible credentials files (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf or environment variables).",
  "plan": "1) Check if a MySQL/MariaDB client is available (mysql --version). 2) Check for a running mysqld process to see if the server is running. 3) List common MySQL data and config directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql). 4) If present, display /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which often contains admin credentials in Debian-based images. 5) If we find credentials or a socket, next step would be to connect with the mysql client and then run the SQL you ask for. I will run a sequence of quick inspection commands to discover the MySQL environment.",
