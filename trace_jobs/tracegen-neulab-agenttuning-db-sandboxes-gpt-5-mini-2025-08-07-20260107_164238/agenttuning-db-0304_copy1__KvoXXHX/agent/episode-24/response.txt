  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running inside the container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is currently no pending SQL operation because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact question or operation you want performed against the MySQL instance. After you state the question I will: 1) Briefly explain the problem and the SQL approach I will use (my thoughts). 2) If an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) in the required format: preceded by 'Action: Operation' and the SQL in a single markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse the output and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples you can request now (tell me which one or give a custom question): - Show databases: SHOW DATABASES; - Show tables in a DB: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - Show table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - Read sample rows: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide table and conditions).",
