  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. You (or I) installed default-mysql-server and default-mysql-client, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe so the server is running and accessible as root with no password via the local socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement has been executed in this round because you have not yet provided the specific question or operation to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact question you want answered against the MySQL instance (for example: list databases, list tables in a specific database, show schema for a table, run a SELECT query, or perform a modification). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If an operation is required, output a single SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL in a single markdown code block as you specified. You will execute that SQL and return the output; I will parse the output and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format when complete.",
