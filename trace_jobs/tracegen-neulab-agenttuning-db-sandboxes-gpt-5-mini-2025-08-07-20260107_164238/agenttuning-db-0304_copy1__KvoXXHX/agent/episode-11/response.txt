  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so the root account currently has no password and the socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found in /app or /etc. No SQL statement is currently pending—I'm waiting for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact question or database operation. When you provide it I will: (1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (and no other SQL blocks). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples of operations you can request (I will produce the single-line SQL to run): - List databases: SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; - Show table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table; - View rows from a table: SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10; - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table; - Find rows with condition: SELECT * FROM dbname.table WHERE column='value' LIMIT 100; If you want me to inspect the server (e.g., list databases or tables) now, tell me which inspection to run and I will provide the single SQL statement in the required format.",
