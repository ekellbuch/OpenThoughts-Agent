  "analysis": "The MySQL client and server are now installed and running in the container. You previously installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server. The mysqld process was started (via mysqld_safe) and a test SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so the root account currently has no password and local socket access works (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). No other application-specific databases or credentials were discovered in /app or /etc.",
  "plan": "I will wait for the question you want answered against this MySQL instance. When you provide a question, I will: 1) Explain the problem and the SQL approach I will use. 2) Decide whether I need to run SQL operations (if so, I will provide exactly one SQL statement in a single markdown code block as required). 3) You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either continue with additional operations or produce the final answer. If you want me to run a SQL query now (e.g., list tables in a database, query a particular table, or modify data), tell me the exact question/goal and I will produce the single-line SQL statement to execute. Example operations I can run next include: SHOW TABLES IN dbname; SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...; or SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; — I will format the SQL according to the required rules when you ask me to operate.",
