  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is reachable as root with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending because you have not yet specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact question or operation you want performed against this MySQL instance. After you provide the question I will: 1) Briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If you want an operation, I will respond with Action: Operation and provide exactly one SQL statement (one line) inside a single markdown SQL code block as you required. You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the exact Action: Answer format. To help you choose, here are common immediate requests I can run for inspection (I will convert your choice into one SQL statement when you ask): - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Or any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (specify the table and conditions).",
