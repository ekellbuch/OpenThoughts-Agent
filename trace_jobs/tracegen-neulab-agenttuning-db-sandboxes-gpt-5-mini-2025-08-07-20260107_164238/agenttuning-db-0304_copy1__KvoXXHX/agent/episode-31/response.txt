You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is running and root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior check returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. Currently you have not provided a specific question or operation to run against the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts briefly, and 2) either (a) produce Action: Operation followed by exactly one SQL statement (one line) inside a single markdown code block for you to execute, or (b) if no further DB operations are needed, produce Action: Answer with the final answer array. If you prefer, you can ask me to run an initial inspection; pick one of these and I will return the single SQL to execute: - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; Or provide a custom query or modification (specify database/table/conditions).",
