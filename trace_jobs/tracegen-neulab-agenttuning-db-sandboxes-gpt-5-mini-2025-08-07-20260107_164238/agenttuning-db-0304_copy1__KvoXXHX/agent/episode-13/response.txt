  "analysis": "The container now has a working MySQL server and client. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root can connect with no password via the local socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is no pending SQL operation — I am waiting for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact question or database operation to perform. When you provide it I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, output a single SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). Examples of possible next operations I can produce when asked: - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE ... LIMIT 100; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; If you want me to run an immediate inspection now, tell me which of those operations to execute and I will provide the single-line SQL statement.",
