  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is running and root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is currently no pending SQL operation because you have not specified the database question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question or operation you want performed against the MySQL instance. Once you provide it I will (1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) either produce a single SQL statement (one line) inside a single markdown SQL code block preceded by 'Action: Operation' for you to execute, or, if no further DB operations are needed, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want a quick inspection to start, choose one of these and I will emit the corresponding single SQL: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table. If you want a different query or a data modification, specify the target database/table and conditions.",
