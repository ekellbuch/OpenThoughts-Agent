  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in this container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root has no password and the socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is currently pending — I'm waiting for you to specify the exact database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact question or database operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: (1) explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you prefer, tell me a specific inspection to run now (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10;).",
