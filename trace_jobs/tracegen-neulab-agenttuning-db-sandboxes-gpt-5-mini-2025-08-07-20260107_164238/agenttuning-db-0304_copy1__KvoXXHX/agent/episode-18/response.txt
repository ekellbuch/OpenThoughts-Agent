  "analysis": "Current state: A MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container (mysqld was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started via mysqld_safe). The root user has no password and the server socket is at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending because you haven't specified the question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Once you provide it, I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, produce a single SQL statement (one line) in a single markdown SQL code block and prefix it with 'Action: Operation' as you requested. You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue (either issuing another single SQL operation or producing the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format). Examples of operations you can request now (I'll convert your choice into one SQL statement when you ask): - List databases: SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - Show a table's schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - Read rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Find rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE column='value' LIMIT 100; If you prefer, tell me a custom question and I will craft the single SQL to run.",
