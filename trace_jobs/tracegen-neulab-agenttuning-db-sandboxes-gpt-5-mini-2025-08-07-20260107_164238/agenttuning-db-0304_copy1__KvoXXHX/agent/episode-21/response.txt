  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is reachable as root with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is currently no SQL pending and you have not yet specified the specific database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). Possible immediate inspections you can ask me to run (I'll provide the single-line SQL when you request one): - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (specify table and conditions). Tell me which operation you want and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
