  "analysis": "We installed the MySQL client successfully but there was no MySQL server running (socket missing). No environment variables or config files with credentials were found. To run SQL queries we need a running server; since no remote connection info was provided, the next step is to install a local MySQL server, initialize it (with an empty root password so we can connect), and start the server in this container. After the server is running I'll connect with the mysql client and run SHOW DATABASES to confirm. The container may not have an init system, so I'll start the mysqld process directly (initializing the data directory insecurely so root has no password).",
  "plan": "1) Install the default MySQL server package so we have a mysqld binary. 2) Ensure /var/run/mysqld exists and is owned by the mysql user. 3) Initialize the data directory with --initialize-insecure (this sets an empty root password). 4) Start mysqld in the background (skip networking for safety; we'll use the local socket). 5) Wait a moment for the server to come up, then run: SHOW DATABASES; to confirm server availability and list databases.",
