  "analysis": "A MySQL server and client are installed and running in this container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to run an immediate inspection now, tell me which operation (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;).",
