A previous SHOW DATABASES returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. Everything is ready to run SQL against the local MySQL instance as root (no password) via the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact question or operation you want performed on the database. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) in a single code block preceded by 'Action: Operation' as you requested. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either request another single SQL operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to run an immediate inspection (e.g., list databases, list tables in a specific database, or show table schema), tell me which operation and I will produce the single-line SQL statement to execute.",
