  "analysis": "You have a running MySQL server and client inside the container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous check returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending because you haven't specified a question or operation to run against the database.",
  "plan": "I am waiting for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) Briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If an operation is required, I will output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either issue another single SQL operation or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. To help you decide, here are common requests you can ask me to run now (I'll convert your choice into the single-line SQL): - List databases: SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - Show a table's schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - Inspect rows: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Find rows by condition: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE column='value' LIMIT 100; If you want a modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), specify the target table and the exact changes you want. If you prefer, tell me to run a quick inspection (for example, list databases or list tables from a particular DB) and I will produce the single SQL statement.",
