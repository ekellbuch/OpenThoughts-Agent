  "analysis": "The container currently does not have a MySQL client installed: attempts to run `mysql` returned \"command not found\". There are no obvious MySQL-related environment variables, and no mysqld/mariadbd processes were found in the process list. The common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql) either don't contain accessible files or are empty. To run SQL against a MySQL server we need a client. It's possible a remote DB is intended, but no connection info was provided. The immediate next step is to install a MySQL client (or MariaDB client) in this container and then attempt a connection (e.g., try SHOW DATABASES as root with no password).",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) non-interactively. 3) Use the mysql client to attempt a connection as root with no password and run: SHOW DATABASES; — this will reveal available databases and confirm connectivity. If the install or connection fails, we'll inspect error output and adapt (e.g., provide credentials or look for a socket).",
