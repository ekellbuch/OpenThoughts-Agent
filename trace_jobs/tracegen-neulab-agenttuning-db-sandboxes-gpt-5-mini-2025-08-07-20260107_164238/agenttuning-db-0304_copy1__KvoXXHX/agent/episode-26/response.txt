  "analysis": "The container now has a working local MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is running and root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is currently no pending SQL operation because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: (1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by the text 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (as you requested). You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either issue another single SQL operation or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. To help choose an operation, you can ask me to run one of these inspections (I will provide the single-line SQL when you request it): - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - A custom SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (specify table and conditions).",
