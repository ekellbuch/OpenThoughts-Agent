The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so the root account currently has no password and the socket is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior check returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending — I'm waiting for the exact question or operation you want performed against this MySQL instance.",
  "plan": "Tell me the exact database question or operation you want (examples: list databases, list tables in a database, show schema for a table, run a SELECT query, or modify data). When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format when complete. If you want me to run an immediate inspection, pick one: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10;",
