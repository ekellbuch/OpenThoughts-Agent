  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root can connect with no password via the local socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending — you have not yet specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question or operation you want performed against this MySQL instance. Possible requests include: - Inspect the server: SHOW DATABASES; - Inspect a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - Inspect a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - Query rows: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE ... LIMIT 100; - Aggregate/count: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Modify data: UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE (specify details). When you specify the desired operation, I will: 1) explain the problem and the SQL approach, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement (one line) inside a single markdown SQL code block preceded by 'Action: Operation' as you required. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format.",
