  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in this container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so the root user currently has no password and the server socket is at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is currently pending because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) Briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by the text 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (no other SQL blocks). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples of things you can ask me to run now: - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Any specific SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT you need (specify the table and condition).",
