  "analysis": "We successfully installed the MySQL client, but there is no local MySQL server running: mysql client returned ERROR 2002 because /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock does not exist. No MySQL-related environment variables were found earlier. To proceed with SQL queries we need a reachable MySQL server — either a local server (which we can try to start/install) or remote connection details (host, port, user, password). Right now the environment has the client but no server, and no obvious credentials/config in the environment yet. Next steps are to search the filesystem for any existing MySQL socket files or configuration/credential files, check /etc/mysql, and attempt to start a local server only if no external DB info is found or provided.",
  "plan": "1) Search the filesystem for any MySQL socket files (this will reveal if a server is running under a different socket path). 2) Search /app and /etc for common DB config or environment files that might contain DB connection info (look for strings like mysql, mariadb, DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DATABASE_URL). 3) Inspect /etc/mysql for configs. 4) Check service status for mysql and attempt to start the service if no external DB info is found. If we find connection info we will use it to run SQL queries; otherwise, if we successfully start a local server we'll run SHOW DATABASES to confirm. I will run these checks and then either request DB credentials or proceed to operate against the discovered server.",
