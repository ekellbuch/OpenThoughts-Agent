  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container (mysqld started via mysqld_safe). The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure so root currently has no password and is reachable via the local socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending: you have not yet provided the specific database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: (1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block, per your rules. Examples you can request now: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table; or specify any custom query or modification. After you execute the single SQL I provide and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue (either issuing another single SQL or giving the final answer in 'Action: Answer' format).",
