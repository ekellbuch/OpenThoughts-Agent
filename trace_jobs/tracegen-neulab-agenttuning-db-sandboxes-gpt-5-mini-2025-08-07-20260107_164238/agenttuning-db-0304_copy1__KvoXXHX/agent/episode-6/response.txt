  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in this container. You previously installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server; mysqld was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started via mysqld_safe. A SHOW DATABASES check returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. What has been accomplished: environment inspected, MySQL client/server installed, server initialized and started, basic connectivity verified. What still needs to be done: you must provide the specific question (what data or modification you want done against the database). Once you provide that, I will explain my approach and either (a) run one SQL statement (Action: Operation) formatted exactly as you specified, or (b) commit the final answer (Action: Answer) when finished.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain the problem and my plan (what SQL will achieve and why). 2) If an operation is required, produce a single SQL statement (one line) inside the required SQL code block preceded by 'Action: Operation'. That SQL will be the only SQL code in the first code block and I will only expect you to execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output. 3) Based on the output you return, I'll parse results and either issue another single SQL operation or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Example SQLs I may run when asked: - To list databases: SHOW DATABASES; - To list tables in a DB: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; - To inspect table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table; - To query rows: SELECT * FROM dbname.table WHERE condition; Each SQL will be one line and only one statement per operation, as you required.",
