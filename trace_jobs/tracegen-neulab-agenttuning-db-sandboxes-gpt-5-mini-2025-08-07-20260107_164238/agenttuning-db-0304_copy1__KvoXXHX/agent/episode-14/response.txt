  "analysis": "The container has a working local MySQL server and client. Steps already completed: installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is reachable as root with no password via the local socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or credentials were discovered under /app or /etc. What remains: you have not yet specified the database question or operation you want performed against this MySQL instance.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me the exact question or operation you want against the database. When you provide that, I will: 1) explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts briefly, and 2) produce exactly one SQL statement (one line) prefixed by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL in a single markdown code block, per your instructions. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse it, possibly request another single SQL statement, or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples of operations you can request (I will convert your choice into a single-line SQL when you ask): - List databases: SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - Show a table's schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - Read rows: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Find rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE column='value' LIMIT 100; Tell me which of these (or another specific question) you want me to run.",
