  "analysis": "The MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so the root account currently has no password and is reachable via the local socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). A previous check returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is currently pending because you have not specified the database question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (as you requested). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples of operations you can request now (I will produce the corresponding single-line SQL when you ask): - List databases: SHOW DATABASES; - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - Show a table's schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - Read rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Find rows by condition: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE column='value' LIMIT 100; If you want me to run a specific inspection now, tell me which one and I will produce the required single SQL statement.",
