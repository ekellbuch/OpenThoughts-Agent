  "analysis": "Current state: A MySQL server and client have been installed and the server is running in this container (mysqld started via mysqld_safe). The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure, so root has no password and socket path is /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A quick check returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or credentials were found in /app or /etc during earlier searches. What has been accomplished: environment inspected, mysql client installed, mysql server installed and started, and basic connectivity confirmed with SHOW DATABASES. What still needs to be done: you must provide the specific question you want answered against the database (e.g., list tables, query a particular table, aggregate data, or modify data). Once you provide the question, I will (1) explain the problem and my planned SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) either produce one SQL statement to run (Action: Operation) or, if finished, produce the Action: Answer final response as specified. Note: when I provide SQL to be executed, I will include exactly one SQL statement in the first markdown SQL code block and nothing else in that code block, per your rules.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the question you want answered from the MySQL instance. After you provide the question I will: - Explain the problem and my approach (brief reasoning/thoughts). - If an operation is required, I will output Action: Operation and a single SQL statement (one line) in a markdown code block; you will run it and return the raw MySQL output. - I will then parse that output, possibly request further operations, or produce the final answer in the exact Action: Answer format when ready. If you want me to inspect the server now (for example, list databases or tables), tell me which operation you want and I will produce the single SQL statement accordingly.",
