  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root has no password and the socket is at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or credentials were found under /app or /etc. Currently there is no pending SQL to execute — I'm waiting for you to specify the exact question or operation you want performed against this MySQL instance.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact database question or operation. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts. 2) If an operation is needed, produce exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (no other SQL blocks). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either issue another single SQL operation or produce the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format. If you prefer, you can ask me to run a quick inspection first (examples: SHOW DATABASES;, SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;, SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table;, SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10;).",
