  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is running and root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is pending because you have not provided a specific question or requested operation to run against the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). Examples of immediate operations you can ask me to run (I will produce the single-line SQL when asked): - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (provide table and conditions). Please tell me which operation or question you want me to perform.",
