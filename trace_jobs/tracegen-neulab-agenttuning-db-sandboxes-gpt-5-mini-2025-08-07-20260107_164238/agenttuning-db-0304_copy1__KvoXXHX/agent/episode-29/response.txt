  "analysis": "The container now has a working MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is running and root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is no pending SQL operation because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I am waiting for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) if an operation is required, output exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want an initial inspection, tell me which of these to run and I will produce the single-line SQL: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table.",
