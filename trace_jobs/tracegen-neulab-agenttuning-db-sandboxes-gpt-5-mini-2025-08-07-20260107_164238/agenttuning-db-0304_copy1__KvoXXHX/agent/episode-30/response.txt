  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. You installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory with --initialize-insecure, and started mysqld_safe. The server is running and root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were found under /app or /etc. There is currently no pending SQL operation because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. After you specify the question I will: 1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and 2) either (a) produce exactly one SQL statement (one line) in the required 'Action: Operation' format (you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output) or (b) if no further DB operations are needed, produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to run an initial inspection first, choose one of these and I will output the single SQL to execute: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; or provide a custom question (specify database/table/conditions).",
