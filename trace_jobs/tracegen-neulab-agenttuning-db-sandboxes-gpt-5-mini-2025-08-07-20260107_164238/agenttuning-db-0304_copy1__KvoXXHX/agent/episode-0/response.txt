  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in a container (bash warnings about job control are normal here). No commands have been run yet in this session. The task requires interacting with a MySQL database via SQL; before issuing SQL statements I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is present, whether the mysql client is available, and what credentials (if any) are usable. I will probe the environment, check for running mysqld processes and MySQL data/socket files, and then attempt a simple mysql client connection (SHOW DATABASES) as root with no password. The outputs of these probes will tell us the next steps (e.g., use a password, use a socket, or operate on a different server).",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client program is installed (mysql --version). 2) Inspect environment variables for any MYSQL_* credentials or connection info. 3) See whether a mysqld/mariadbd process is running. 4) List common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld and /var/lib/mysql) to find sockets or data. 5) Try a simple connection as root without a password to get a list of databases (this executes a single SQL statement). Based on results, I'll report what I find and either request the question you want answered or proceed with further SQL operations. Each command is designed to be quick; if a step shows that a password or different connection method is required, I'll adapt.",
