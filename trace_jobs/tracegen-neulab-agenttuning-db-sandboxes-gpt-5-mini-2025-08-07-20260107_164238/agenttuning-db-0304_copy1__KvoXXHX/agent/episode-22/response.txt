  "analysis": "A local MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The server was initialized with --initialize-insecure and started (mysqld_safe), so root can connect with no password via the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or DB credentials were discovered under /app or /etc. No SQL statement is currently pending because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. Once you provide it, I will: (1) briefly explain the problem and my SQL approach/thoughts, and (2) if an operation is required, produce exactly one SQL statement (one line) preceded by 'Action: Operation' with the SQL inside a single markdown code block (per your rules). You will run only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and either request/run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples you can request now: - SHOW DATABASES; - SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; - SHOW CREATE TABLE your_db.your_table; - SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10; - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; - Any specific SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (specify table and conditions).",
