  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and a MySQL server (8.0) was installed and manually started with --skip-networking; it is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root with no password. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you specify what you want, I will (1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). Examples of actions you can request now: - \"List all databases\" (SHOW DATABASES;) - \"List tables in database <db>\" (SHOW TABLES FROM db;) - \"Describe a table <db>.<table>\" (DESCRIBE db.table;) - \"Show rows from <db>.<table> where <condition>\" (SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...;) - \"Count rows in <db>.<table>\" (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;) - \"Insert/Update/Delete rows\" (provide exact change). Tell me which of these (or another SQL task) you want, and I will provide the single SQL statement to run.",
