There's no information about a running MySQL server, available clients, or database credentials. To proceed with helping you operate a MySQL database I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, where its socket is, and whether a client is available and usable without a password. Nothing has been queried from MySQL yet.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current working directory and basic environment (confirm root and present files). 2) Check for a running mysqld process. 3) Look for common MySQL directories and socket path. 4) Check whether the mysql client is installed and its version. 5) Attempt a non-interactive query (SHOW DATABASES) as root without a password; if that fails, the output will guide next steps (e.g., using a socket or credentials). Each command is intended to reveal information needed to connect to and operate the database.",
