  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running (started manually with --skip-networking) and the mysql client is available (mysql 8.0). The server is reachable via the Unix socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) and the client can connect as root with no password. Current databases are only the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet specified a question or requested any particular SQL operation.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the specific database question or operation you want performed. When you provide that question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block (no other comments). You will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either provide another operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. If you prefer, you can ask me to explore the server (examples: list all databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, etc.).",
