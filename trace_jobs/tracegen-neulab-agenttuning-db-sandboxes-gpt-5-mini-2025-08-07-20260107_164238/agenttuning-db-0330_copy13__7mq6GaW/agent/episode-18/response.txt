  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and a MySQL server (8.0) was installed and started manually with --skip-networking; it is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root with no password. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not asked a specific database question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run to answer it, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format starting with 'Action: Operation' and including a single SQL code block. You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either request another operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you prefer exploratory actions now, you can ask one of: list databases, list tables in a given database (SHOW TABLES FROM db;), describe a table (DESCRIBE db.table;), select rows with a condition (SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...;), or count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;).",
