  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and a MySQL server (8.0) was installed and manually started with --skip-networking; it's reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root with no password (mysql -uroot works). The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not specified any particular question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run to answer it, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start the response with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will interpret it and either provide another operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Examples of actions you can request now: - List all databases (SHOW DATABASES;) - List tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;) - Describe a table structure (DESCRIBE dbname.tablename;) - Show rows from a table with a condition (SELECT * FROM dbname.tablename WHERE ...;) - Count rows in a table (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.tablename;) - Insert/Update/Delete rows (specify exact change). Please tell me which action or question you want to run next.",
