  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app. A MySQL server was installed and started manually with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and can connect as root without a password. Current databases are only the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't requested a specific query or operation yet.",
  "plan": "Wait for your specific database question or the operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain what I'll do and why. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include the SQL in a single code block). You will run that SQL and return the output; I will interpret the output and either provide a next operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want to explore the server now, tell me one of: list databases, list tables in a database (specify database), describe a table (specify database.table), select rows with a condition (specify database/table and condition), or perform a modification (state the change).",
