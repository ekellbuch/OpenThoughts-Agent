  "analysis": "MySQL server is now running (started manually) and the mysql client is installed. A previous mysql client command successfully connected and returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The server process was started with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. We have root access to the server without a password (mysql -uroot works). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet.",
  "plan": "I'll gather a bit more metadata so we're ready to answer questions about users, databases, and tables. Specifically: 1) List MySQL users to see available accounts and hosts. 2) List databases (repeat to be explicit). 3) If you request a particular database or question next, I'll run the single SQL you ask for (I will format that as required). The commands below are non-interactive mysql client invocations that return the server metadata.",
