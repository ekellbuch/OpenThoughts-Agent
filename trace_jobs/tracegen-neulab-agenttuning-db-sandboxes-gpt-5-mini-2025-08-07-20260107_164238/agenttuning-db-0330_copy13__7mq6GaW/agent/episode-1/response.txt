  "analysis": "We are at a root shell in /app. The system is minimal: there are no files in /app aside from . and .., and no mysqld process is running. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). We haven't yet determined the OS/distribution. To operate a MySQL server via SQL we first need a MySQL client available in this environment. Even if the client is installed, there may be no local server running; attempting a query will reveal connection details or errors which will guide next steps.",
  "plan": "1) Detect the OS/distribution to choose the correct package manager. 2) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so we can run SQL commands from this shell. 3) Verify the client is installed. 4) Attempt a basic non-interactive query (SHOW DATABASES;) as root to see if a local server is reachable or to capture the error message (e.g., connection refused, no socket, or access denied). If the query fails we will inspect the error to decide whether to start a server, connect via socket, or use credentials. Commands below follow that sequence.",
