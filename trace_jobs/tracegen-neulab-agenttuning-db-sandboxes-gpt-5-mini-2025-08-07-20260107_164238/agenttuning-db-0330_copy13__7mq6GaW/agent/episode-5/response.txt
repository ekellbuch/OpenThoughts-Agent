  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in this container (mysqld started with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and connecting as root with no password. Current databases are the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table shows only system users plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or data have been inspected yet because you haven't asked a specific query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for the specific question you want answered about the database. Tell me what you want to do (examples: list all databases, list tables in a given database, show rows from a specific table with conditions, count rows, find top values, modify data, etc.). After you state the question, I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run. 2) Provide the SQL in the exact required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I'll interpret it and either run another operation or, if finished, provide the final answer in the exact format you requested.",
