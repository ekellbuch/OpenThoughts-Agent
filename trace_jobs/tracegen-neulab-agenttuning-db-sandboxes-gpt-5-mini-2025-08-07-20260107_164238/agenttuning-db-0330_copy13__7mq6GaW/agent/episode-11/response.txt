  "analysis": "Current environment summary: you are root in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (8.0) was installed, and a MySQL server (8.0) was installed and manually started in this container using mysqld --skip-networking. The server is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root without a password (mysql -uroot works). The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root (debian-sys-maint, mysql.infoschema, mysql.session, mysql.sys, root). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected yet because you haven't specified a question or requested any specific SQL to run. The server was not started via systemctl (policy-rc.d prevented the packaged init script from running), so it was launched manually; that is fine but means service management via systemctl isn't available in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. Possible requests include: - list databases, - list tables in a specific database (I will run SHOW TABLES FROM db;), - describe a table structure (DESCRIBE db.table;), - select rows with particular conditions (SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...;), - count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;), or - modify data (UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE). When you give the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I plan to run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and then either provide another operation or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. Tell me which database/table or the question you want answered now.",
