  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and a MySQL server (8.0) was installed and started manually with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root with no password. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run to answer it, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will interpret it and either request another operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. To proceed now, please tell me one specific action to run (examples):\n- \"List all databases\"\n- \"Show tables in database <db>\"\n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\"\n- \"Select rows from <db>.<table> where <condition>\"\n- \"Count rows in <db>.<table>\"\n- \"Insert/Update/Delete rows in <db>.<table>\"\nI will then provide the single SQL statement to execute.",
