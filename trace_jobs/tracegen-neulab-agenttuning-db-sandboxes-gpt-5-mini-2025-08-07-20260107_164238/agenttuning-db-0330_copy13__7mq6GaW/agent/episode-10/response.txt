  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app. A MySQL server was installed and manually started with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and can connect as root without a password. The only databases present are the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested a SQL operation yet.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the specific database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and what SQL I plan to run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format: start with 'Action: Operation' and include the SQL in a single markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either provide another operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. If you prefer, you can ask me to explore the server now (examples: list all databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, etc.).",
