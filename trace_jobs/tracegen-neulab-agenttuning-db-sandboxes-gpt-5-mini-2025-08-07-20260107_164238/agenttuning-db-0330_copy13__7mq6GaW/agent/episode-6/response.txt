  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in this container (mysqld started with --skip-networking). The mysql client is available and can connect as root without a password. Current databases are only the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table shows only system users plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't given a database question or requested any specific SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the specific database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain what I plan to do and why. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single line) in the required format: start the response with 'Action: Operation', then include a single SQL statement in a markdown code block. You will run only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; after that I will interpret the output and either provide another operation or, if finished, produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. If you want to explore the server first, you can ask me to list databases, list tables in a particular database, describe a table, or select rows with conditions. If you want me to modify data, state the change you want.",
