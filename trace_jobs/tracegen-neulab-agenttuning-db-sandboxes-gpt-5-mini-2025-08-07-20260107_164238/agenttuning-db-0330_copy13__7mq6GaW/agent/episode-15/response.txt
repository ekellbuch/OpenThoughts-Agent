  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. A MySQL server (8.0) was installed and manually started with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client is installed and can connect as root with no password. The only databases currently present are the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or the operation you want performed. To help you decide, here are common options you can request now (pick one):\n- List all databases\n- List tables in a specific database (tell me the database name)\n- Describe a table structure (tell me database.table)\n- Show rows from a table with a condition (tell me database, table, and condition)\n- Count rows in a table (tell me database.table)\n- Insert/Update/Delete rows (specify exact change)\nWhen you tell me which action you want, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and continue or produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format.",
