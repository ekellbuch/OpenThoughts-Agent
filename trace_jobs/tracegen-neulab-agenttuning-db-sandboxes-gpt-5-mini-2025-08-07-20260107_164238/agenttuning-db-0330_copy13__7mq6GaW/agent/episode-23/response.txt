  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. MySQL server (8.0) is installed and running (started manually with --skip-networking) and the mysql client is available and can connect as root with no password via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet because you haven't requested a specific question. To proceed I should inspect the server metadata (tables) so I can answer or craft further queries.",
  "plan": "List the tables in the 'mysql' system database to see what system tables exist (this will show user, db, and other system tables). That will help determine what data is available and guide any subsequent queries you request. I'll run a single non-interactive mysql client command to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; and review the output.",
