  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0) is installed and the MySQL server (mysqld) was installed and started manually with --skip-networking; it is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root with no password. Present databases are only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not yet specified a particular question or SQL operation to perform.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run to answer it, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either provide another operation or, if finished, deliver the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified.",
