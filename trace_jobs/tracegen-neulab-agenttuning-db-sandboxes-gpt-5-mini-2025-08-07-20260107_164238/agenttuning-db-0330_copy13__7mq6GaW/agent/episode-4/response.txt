  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running on this container. The server was started manually with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client can connect as root without a password (mysql -uroot works). Current databases are the default ones: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. Current MySQL users (from mysql.user) are: debian-sys-maint, mysql.infoschema, mysql.session, mysql.sys, and root — all with Host = localhost. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet.",
  "plan": "I'll wait for the specific question you want answered about the database. When you give a question, I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the SQL I intend to run. 2) If you approve, I will provide a single SQL statement in the required format (one-line, in an SQL code block) as the \"Action: Operation\". You will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output; then I will interpret the output and either run another operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact format you requested. If you want me to list databases/tables/rows now, tell me which database/table or ask a specific question (e.g., \"list all tables in database X\", \"show rows from table Y where ...\", or a business question that requires SQL).",
