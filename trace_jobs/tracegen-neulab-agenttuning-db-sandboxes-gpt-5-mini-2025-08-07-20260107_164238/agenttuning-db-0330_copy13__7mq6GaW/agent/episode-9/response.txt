  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. A MySQL server was installed and started manually (mysqld running with --skip-networking and using /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). The mysql client (8.0) is installed and can connect as root without a password. Current databases are the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts and root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't requested any specific query or operation.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to specify the database question or operation. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format: begin with 'Action: Operation' and include the SQL in a single markdown code block. You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either give another operation or, if finished, return the final answer using 'Action: Answer' with the exact expected format. If you want exploratory commands now, suggest one of: list databases, list tables in a database (specify database), describe a table (specify database.table), or select rows with a condition (specify database/table and condition).",
