  "analysis": "The MySQL server that I started earlier has been killed (the shell shows the background mysqld was Killed and subsequent connection returned Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket ... (111)). Likely the server process was terminated (OOM or similar). No application databases were present earlier; only system DBs existed. To continue, we need to inspect the MySQL error log to learn why it was killed (if available) and then attempt to restart the mysqld process, re-check that it's running, and then re-run the requested metadata query (SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;).",
  "plan": "1) List and tail the MySQL error log to see why mysqld exited. 2) Ensure the socket/run directory exists and has correct ownership. 3) Start mysqld again in the background (with --skip-networking as before). 4) Confirm mysqld is running. 5) Re-run the SQL: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; to list system tables. Each step is a single shell command; if mysqld fails to start the error log will guide the next action.",
