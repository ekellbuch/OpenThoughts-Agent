  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. A MySQL server (8.0) was installed and manually started with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client is installed and can connect as root with no password. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run to answer it, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format beginning with 'Action: Operation' and a single SQL code block. You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either provide another operation or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format.",
