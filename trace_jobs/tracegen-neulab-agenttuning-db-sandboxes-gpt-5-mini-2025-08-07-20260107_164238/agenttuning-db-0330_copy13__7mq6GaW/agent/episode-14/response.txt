  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. A MySQL server (8.0) was installed and started manually with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client is installed and can connect as root without a password. The only databases currently present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. Possible requests you can make now: (a) list all databases, (b) list tables in a specific database, (c) describe a specific table, (d) SELECT rows from a table with conditions, (e) COUNT rows in a table, or (f) perform data modifications (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). When you give the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). You will run only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and either provide another operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to explore the server now, tell me which exploratory action to run and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
