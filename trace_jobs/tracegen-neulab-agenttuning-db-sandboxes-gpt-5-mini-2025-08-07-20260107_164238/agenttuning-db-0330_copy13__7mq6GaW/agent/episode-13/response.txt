  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and the server is running (started manually with --skip-networking). The mysql client can connect as root without a password via the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. Present databases are only the defaults: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not specified any particular question or SQL to run yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can ask: - \"List all databases\" - \"Show tables in database <db>\" - \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" - \"Select rows from <db>.<table> where <condition>\" - \"Count rows in <db>.<table>\" - \"Insert/Update/Delete rows in <db>.<table>\" When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and continue until we can produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format.",
