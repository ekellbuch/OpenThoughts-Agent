  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in this container (started manually with --skip-networking) and the mysql client (8.0) is available. The server is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and the mysql client can connect as root without a password. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you have not given a specific question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run to answer it. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format starting with 'Action: Operation' and a single SQL code block. You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and then either provide another operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you'd like exploratory queries now, possible requests include: - list databases (SHOW DATABASES;), - list tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM db;), - describe a table (DESCRIBE db.table;), - show rows with a condition (SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...;), or - count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;). Tell me which specific question or operation to run.",
