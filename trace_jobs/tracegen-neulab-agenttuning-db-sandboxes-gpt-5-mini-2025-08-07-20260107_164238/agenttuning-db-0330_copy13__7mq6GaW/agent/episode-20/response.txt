  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app on Ubuntu 24.04. A MySQL server (8.0) was installed and manually started with --skip-networking and is reachable via the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client (8.0) is installed and can connect as root without a password. The only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The mysql.user table contains only system accounts plus root. No application-specific databases, tables, or rows have been inspected because you haven't asked a specific question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the single SQL statement I intend to run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL code block). After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output I will interpret it and either request another operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. If you prefer exploratory actions now, tell me one of: list databases, list tables in a database (specify database), describe a table (specify database.table), select rows with a condition (specify database/table and condition), or count rows.",
