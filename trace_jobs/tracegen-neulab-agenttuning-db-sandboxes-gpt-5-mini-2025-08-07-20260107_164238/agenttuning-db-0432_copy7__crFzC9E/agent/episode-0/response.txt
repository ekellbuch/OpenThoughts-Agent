  "analysis": "We're at a root shell in /app inside a container. No commands have been run yet. There's no visibility into a MySQL server or client from the prompt. To proceed with operating a MySQL database we need to discover whether a MySQL server is running in this environment, locate the socket or port, and check whether a mysql client is available and any relevant environment variables (like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD or connection info). Once we find the server and connection details, we can run the requested SQL statements. Right now nothing has been accomplished; discovery is needed.",
  "plan": "I will inspect the filesystem and processes to find MySQL server or client and any connection info. Steps: 1) Print working directory and list files in /app to see project files. 2) Check for MySQL configuration directories (/etc/mysql) and database files (/var/lib/mysql) and runtime socket (/var/run/mysqld). 3) Look for a running mysqld process. 4) Check listening ports for 3306. 5) Check if the mysql client is installed and any environment variables starting with MYSQL. These commands will help me determine how to connect to the database and what credentials or socket to use next.",
