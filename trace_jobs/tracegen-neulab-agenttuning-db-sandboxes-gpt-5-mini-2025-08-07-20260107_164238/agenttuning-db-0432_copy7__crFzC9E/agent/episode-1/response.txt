  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL server or client installed. /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist, there is no /etc/mysql, no mysqld process is running, and the mysql client binary is not present. There are also no MYSQL_* environment variables. In short, there is no local MySQL instance to operate on right now and no client to connect with. To run SQL statements we need a mysql client (or access to a remote MySQL server with credentials).",
  "plan": "I'll try to install a MySQL client in this container so we can connect to a database if one becomes available. Steps: 1) Check whether apt-get is present. 2) Run apt-get update to refresh package lists. 3) Install the default-mysql-client package (fallbacks may be attempted if needed). 4) Verify the mysql client is installed by printing its version. If installation fails (no network or missing package manager), I'll report that and ask for connection details for a remote server or for a database dump to be provided.",
