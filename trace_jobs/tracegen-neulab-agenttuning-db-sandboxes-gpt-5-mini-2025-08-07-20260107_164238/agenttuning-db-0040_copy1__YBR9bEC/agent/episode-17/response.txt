  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed successfully in this container. There is no local MySQL server running, no credential files (.my.cnf or similar) were found, and there are no environment variables exposing DB connection details. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or any connection details/outputs to target a database.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you provide either connection details for a target MySQL server or the raw outputs of introspection commands you run on your DB. Choose one of the two options below and supply the requested information.\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (you provide credentials + question):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the precise question you want answered (example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").\n  - I will then: 1) explain the SQL I will run to answer the question, and 2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start the line \"Action: Operation\" then a single SQL code block in markdown containing the one-line SQL). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. After you supply that output I will parse it and either produce another single SQL statement or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n  - Example mysql client invocation from this container (replace placeholders):\n    - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n    - Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n  - Security note: supplying password on the command line can be visible to other users; if you prefer, omit password and use interactive prompt.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection yourself (then paste outputs + question):\n  - Run on your MySQL server and paste the raw outputs here:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any tables relevant to your question)\n  - Also state the precise question you want answered. Based on those outputs I will craft and provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single one-line SQL code block) for you to run. After you return the raw output, I will continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer.\n\nWhen you provide either the connection details + question (Option A) or the introspection outputs + question (Option B), I will: (1) explain my approach and the SQL I will run, and (2) provide the single-line SQL in the exact format you required. Please reply with which option you choose and supply the requested information so I can continue.",
