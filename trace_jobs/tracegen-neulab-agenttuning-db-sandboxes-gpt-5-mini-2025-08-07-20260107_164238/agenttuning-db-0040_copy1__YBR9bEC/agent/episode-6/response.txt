You have not provided a database question nor any connection details (host, port, user, password, database). No SQL has been executed because there's no target to connect to.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL without a target database. Please provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n1) Connection details for the MySQL server you want me to query: host, port (optional, default 3306), username, password, and database name. Once you provide those, I will explain my approach and produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block) for you to execute; after you return the output I will parse it and continue as needed.\n\nOR\n\n2) If you prefer to run commands yourself, run and paste here the outputs of any introspection commands (for example: SHOW DATABASES; USE your_db; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE your_table; or SELECT samples). Also tell me the specific question you want answered about the data (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").\n\nWhen you provide the question and either connection info or the introspection outputs, I will:\n- Explain the SQL I will run and why.\n- Provide a single-line SQL statement inside a single SQL code block prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" (per your required format). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n- Continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer, at which point I will return \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nIf you want me to attempt to connect from this container, tell me the connection details and whether to include the password on the command line or prompt interactively.",
