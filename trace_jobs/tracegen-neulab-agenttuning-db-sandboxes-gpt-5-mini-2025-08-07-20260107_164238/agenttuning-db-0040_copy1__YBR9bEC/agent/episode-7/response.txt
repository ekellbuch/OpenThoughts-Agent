Once you provide the question and one of the above, I will:\n- Explain the approach and the exact SQL I will run.\n- Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block on one line). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n- Parse the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement if needed or finish with Action: Answer and the Final Answer array.\n\nIf you want me to run the query from this container, please provide the connection details and the precise question. If you prefer to run introspection yourself, run the commands below on your MySQL server and paste their outputs here: 1) SHOW DATABASES; 2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES; 3) DESCRIBE your_table (for any relevant table). Then tell me the exact question (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").",
