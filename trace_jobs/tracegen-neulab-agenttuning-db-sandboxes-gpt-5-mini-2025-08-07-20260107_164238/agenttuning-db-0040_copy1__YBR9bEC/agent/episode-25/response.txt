  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. I previously checked for a local server, sockets, credential files and environment variables and found none. No database question, connection details, or introspection outputs have been provided, so I cannot run any SQL against a target database yet. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server from this container, but I need either connection credentials or database introspection output plus the exact question to continue.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you supply one of the two options below. After you provide it and the exact question you want answered, I will (1) explain the approach and the SQL I will run, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me; I will parse it and iterate until I can produce the final answer.\n\nPlease choose one option and supply the requested items:\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (preferred)\n  - Provide: host (hostname or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), database name.\n  - Provide the precise question you want answered (be specific about tables/columns, filters, ordering, limits, date ranges, etc.).\n  - Example client command I would use from this container (replace placeholders):\n    - Non-interactive: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DBNAME -e \"SQL\"\n    - Interactive prompt: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p -D DBNAME\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection locally\n  - Run and paste the raw outputs (exact terminal output) of these commands from your MySQL server and tell me the precise question:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n\nWhen you provide either Option A (credentials + question) or Option B (introspection outputs + question), I will:\n  1) Explain the approach for answering your question and what SQL I will run.\n  2) Provide one SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation followed by a single markdown SQL code block with a one-line SQL statement). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n  3) I will parse the output and either request/produce another single SQL statement, or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer when certain.\n\nReply with which option you choose and supply the required information so I can proceed.",
