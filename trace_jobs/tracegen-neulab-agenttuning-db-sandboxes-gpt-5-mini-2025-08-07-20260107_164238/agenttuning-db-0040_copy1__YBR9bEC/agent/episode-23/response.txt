  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside the container. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server process, no credential/config files (.my.cnf) or environment variables exposing DB connection info, and you have not provided any database question or connection details. Because there is no target database or introspection output, no SQL has been executed and I cannot proceed to query anything from here.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide one of the following. Pick Option A or B and supply the requested items, plus the exact question you want answered (be specific about tables/columns and expected output):\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (you provide credentials + question):\n  - Provide: host (hostname or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer interactive prompt), and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question to answer (for example: \"List the top 5 customers by total_orders from orders table for 2025\").\n  - If you supply credentials and permit connection, I will explain the SQL I will run and then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single one-line SQL block). You will run that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer.\n  - Example client invocations from this container (replace placeholders):\n    - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n    - Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n  - Security note: putting password on the command line can be visible to other users; omit the password to be prompted interactively if you prefer.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection locally (then paste outputs + question):\n  - Run and paste raw outputs (copy/paste the exact terminal output) of these commands on your MySQL server and tell me the precise question:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to the question)\n  - Based on those outputs and your question I will craft the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run and return the results; I will then parse the output and continue until I can produce the final answer.\n\nOnce you provide either (A) credentials + question or (B) introspection outputs + question, I will:\n  1) Explain the approach and what SQL I will run.\n  2) Provide one SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation + single SQL code block in markdown with one-line SQL). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n  3) Parse output and iterate until ready to output Action: Answer and the Final Answer array.\n\nPlease indicate which option you choose and supply the requested information and the exact question to proceed.",
