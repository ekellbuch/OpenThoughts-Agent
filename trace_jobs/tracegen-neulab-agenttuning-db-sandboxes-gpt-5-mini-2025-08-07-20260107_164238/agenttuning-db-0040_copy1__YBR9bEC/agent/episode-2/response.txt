  "analysis": "So far I inspected the container. You're root in /app. There is no MySQL server process running, no mysql client is present, no /var/lib/mysql visible, and no credential files or environment variables indicating connection details. In short: there is currently no local MySQL client/server or discovered credentials to run SQL against.",
  "plan": "To be able to run SQL I need a MySQL client in this environment or connection details for a remote server. I'll attempt to install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so we can connect to a remote MySQL/MariaDB server when you provide host, port, user, password and database or when you give me the SQL question to run. After installing the client I'll verify the client is available and then wait for you to provide the target DB connection details or the question. Commands to run:\n1) apt-get update — refresh package lists.\n2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client — install mysql client noninteractively.\n3) mysql --version — confirm installation.\nThese are nondestructive and prepare the environment to run your SQL.",
