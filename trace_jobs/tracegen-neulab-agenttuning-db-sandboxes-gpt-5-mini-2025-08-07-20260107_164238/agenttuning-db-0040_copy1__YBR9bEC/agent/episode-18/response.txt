  "analysis": "The mysql client was installed successfully in the container (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and I could not find any credential/config files or environment variables that would let me connect to a database. You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or any introspection outputs from your database. Therefore no SQL has been or can be executed yet.",
  "plan": "I need one of two things from you to proceed: Option A — credentials so I can run SQL from this container, or Option B — the raw outputs of introspection commands you run on your MySQL server (if you prefer not to share credentials). After you provide one of these and state the exact question you want answered, I will: 1) explain the approach and the SQL I will run, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me, and I will iterate until I can produce the final answer.\n\nPlease choose one option and provide the requested items:\n- Option A (I connect): supply host, port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the precise question about the data.\n- Option B (you run introspection): run and paste the raw outputs of:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any relevant table)\n  and tell me the precise question.\n\nIf you want an example of how I'll connect from this container when you give credentials, I would run either:\n- Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n- Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nOnce you provide the connection details or the introspection outputs plus the exact question, I will (a) explain the SQL I will use, and (b) produce the single-line SQL in the exact required format for you to execute.",
