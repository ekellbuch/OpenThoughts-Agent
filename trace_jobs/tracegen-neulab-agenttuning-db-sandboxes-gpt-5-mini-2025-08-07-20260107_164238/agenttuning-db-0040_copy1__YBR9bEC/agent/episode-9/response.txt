  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) and is ready to connect to a MySQL server. There is no local MySQL server process, no discovered credential files, and no environment variables exposing connection information. You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database) to target, so no SQL has been executed and I cannot proceed further without that information.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details so I can run queries from this container:\n  - host (or IP)\n  - port (optional, default 3306)\n  - username\n  - password (or indicate you prefer to be prompted)\n  - database name\n  - the precise question you want answered about the data (for example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\")\n\nIf you give credentials, I will:\n  1) Explain the SQL I intend to run to answer your question.\n  2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with the line \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL code block in markdown on one line). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n  3) Parse the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — You run introspection commands on your database and paste the outputs here (if you prefer not to share credentials). Useful commands to run on your MySQL server and paste their raw output here:\n  - SHOW DATABASES;\n  - USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n  - DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n\nAlso, tell me the exact question about the data. Based on that I will craft the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) you must run and return the result.\n\nIf you want an example client command to run from this container when you provide credentials, here are examples (replace placeholders):\n  - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n  - Prompt for password interactively: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nReply with your chosen option, the required connection details or pasted outputs, and the precise question. After that I will (1) explain the approach and (2) produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
