  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. I previously checked for a local MySQL server, sockets, credential files, and environment variables and found none. No database question, connection details, or introspection outputs have been provided, so there is no target to run SQL against and no SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide either Option A (credentials so I can connect from this container) or Option B (you run introspection on your DB and paste the raw outputs). Please choose one option and supply the requested information. After you provide it I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and iterate until I can return the final answer.\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (preferred):\n  - Provide these values: host (hostname or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), database name.\n  - Provide the precise question you want answered (specify tables/columns/filters/order/limit/date ranges etc.).\n  - Example client commands I would run from this container when credentials are provided (replace placeholders):\n    - Prompt for password (safer): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n    - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DBNAME -e \"SQL\"\n  - Security note: avoid pasting passwords in public channels. If you prefer, omit the password and I will use -p to prompt interactively.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection locally:\n  - Run these commands on your MySQL server and paste the exact raw outputs here, and also tell me the precise question:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Based on those outputs and your question I will craft the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) you must run and return results.\n\nNotes about the SQL exchange rules you requested: each operation I provide will follow exactly this pattern:\n  - A leading line: Action: Operation\n  - One SQL code block in markdown containing a single SQL statement on one line (no other SQL blocks or comments).\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. When we are finished I will use: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply either (A) the connection details and the precise question, or (B) the raw introspection outputs and the precise question. After that I will prepare the SQL operation.",
