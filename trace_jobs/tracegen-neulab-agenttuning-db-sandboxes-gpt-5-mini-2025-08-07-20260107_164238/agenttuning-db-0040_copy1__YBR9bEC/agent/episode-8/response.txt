  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client (8.0.44) is installed and ready to use. There is no local MySQL server process, no discovered credential files, and no environment variables exposing connection information. You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, user, password, database) to target, so no SQL has been or can be executed yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL without a target database. Please provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n1) Connection details for the MySQL server you want queried: host, port (if not 3306), username, password, and database name. Also tell me the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from table orders\"). Once you provide that I will:\n   - Explain the approach and the SQL I will run.\n   - Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block on one line). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n   - Parse the output and either produce another single SQL statement if more work is needed, or finish with Action: Answer and the Final Answer array.\n\nOR\n\n2) If you prefer to run commands yourself and paste outputs, run and paste these introspection commands from your MySQL server and tell me the question:\n   - SHOW DATABASES;\n   - USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n   - DESCRIBE your_table; (for any relevant table)\n\nIf you want me to connect from this container, indicate whether to pass the password on the command line or prompt interactively. Example client invocation I would use when credentials are provided:\n   mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n\nReply with the connection details and your precise question, or paste the introspection outputs and the question. After that I'll produce the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) per your rules.",
