  "analysis": "You're in a root shell at /app with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). I checked for a local server, sockets, credential files and environment variables and found none. No database question or connection details have been provided, so no SQL can be executed against any target. The environment is prepared to connect to a remote MySQL server from this container, but I need connection details or database introspection outputs to proceed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you choose one of the two options below and provide the requested information. After you provide it I will (1) explain my approach for answering your question and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a single SQL code block preceded by the line \"Action: Operation\"). You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and iterate until I can return \"Action: Answer\" with the Final Answer array.\n\nPlease choose one option and supply the required items:\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (preferred if you provide credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port if not 3306, username, password (or indicate you prefer interactive prompt), database name, and the precise question you want answered (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").\n  - If you allow me to connect from the container I will run the mysql client like:\n    - Non-interactive: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n    - Interactive prompt: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nOption B — You run introspection locally and paste raw outputs (if you prefer not to share credentials):\n  - Run and paste the raw outputs of these commands on your MySQL server, and tell me the precise question:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any relevant table)\n\nOnce you provide either (A) credentials + question or (B) introspection outputs + question I will:\n  1) Describe the SQL I will run and why.\n  2) Emit one SQL statement in the exact format you required (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one-line SQL). You will execute that and return the output for me to parse.\n\nIf you prefer, tell me which option you choose and provide the details now.",
