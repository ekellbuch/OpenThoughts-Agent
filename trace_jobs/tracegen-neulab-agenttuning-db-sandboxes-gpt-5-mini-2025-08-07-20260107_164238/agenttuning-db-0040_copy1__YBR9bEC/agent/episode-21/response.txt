  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) and is ready to connect to a MySQL server. There is no local MySQL server process, no credential files (.my.cnf) or environment variables exposing DB connection info, and you have not provided a database question or any connection details. No SQL has been executed because there is no target database or question to act on.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide either (A) connection details so I can connect from this container, or (B) the raw outputs of introspection commands you run on your MySQL server. Please choose one option and supply the requested information. Once you provide it I will: (1) explain the approach I will use to answer your question, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown with a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue iteratively until I can return the final answer.\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (provide credentials and the question):\n  - Required: host (or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name.\n  - Also provide the precise question to answer (for example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").\n  - Example mysql client invocations from this container (replace placeholders):\n    - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n    - Interactive password prompt: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection yourself (then paste outputs + question):\n  - Run these commands on your MySQL server and paste the raw outputs here:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Tell me the precise question you want answered.\n\nAfter you supply either the connection details + question (Option A) or the introspection outputs + question (Option B), I will (a) describe the SQL I will run and why, and (b) output exactly one SQL statement in the required \"Action: Operation\" format for you to execute. Please tell me which option you choose and provide the requested information so I can continue.",
