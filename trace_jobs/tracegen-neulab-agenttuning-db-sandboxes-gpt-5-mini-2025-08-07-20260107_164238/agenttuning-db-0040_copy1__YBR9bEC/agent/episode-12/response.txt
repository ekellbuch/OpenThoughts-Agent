You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database). Because there is no target database and no SQL question, I cannot run any SQL from here yet.",

After you provide one of these, I will explain the approach and produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute; you will return the raw MySQL output and I will continue iteratively until I can give the final answer.\n\nPlease choose one option and supply the requested info:\n\nOption A — Give connection details and question\n- host (or IP)\n- port (optional, default 3306)\n- username\n- password (or indicate you prefer to be prompted)\n- database name\n- the precise question you want answered (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\")\n\nIf you want me to connect from this container I'll run the mysql client like one of these (replace placeholders):\n- Non-interactive (password on cmdline): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n- Interactive prompt: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nOption B — You run introspection and paste outputs (no credentials shared)\nRun these on your MySQL server and paste the raw outputs here, then state the exact question:\n1) SHOW DATABASES;\n2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n\nOnce you provide either the connection details or the introspection outputs plus the precise question, I will:\n1) Explain my approach and the SQL I will run.\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required \"Action: Operation\" format (a single SQL code block, one-line SQL). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back.\n3) Parse the output and either produce another single SQL statement or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the requested information so I can continue.",
