  "analysis": "The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed successfully in the container and is available. There is no local MySQL server running, no credential/configuration files were found, and no environment variables expose database connection details. No database question or target connection details have been provided, so no SQL has been executed against any database. The environment is prepared to connect to a remote MySQL server from this container, but I cannot proceed without either connection details or introspection outputs from your database.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details so I can run queries from this container:\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the precise question you want answered about the data.\n  - If you provide credentials, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and paste the raw MySQL output here. I will parse it and iterate until I can produce the final answer, at which point I'll return \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — Keep credentials private and run introspection yourself, then paste outputs here:\n  - Run and paste the raw outputs of these commands on your MySQL server: 1) SHOW DATABASES; 2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES; 3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for relevant tables). Also tell me the precise question you want answered.\n  - Based on those outputs I will craft and provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single one-line SQL code block) for you to run and return the results. I will then parse and iterate as needed.\n\nNotes and examples:\n  - Example mysql client invocations I would use from this container when credentials are provided:\n    - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n    - Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n  - When I supply an SQL operation it will follow your required format exactly: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement. I will only produce one SQL statement per round.\n\nNext step: reply with which option you choose and supply either (A) the connection details + the exact question, or (B) the raw introspection outputs + the exact question. Once you do, I will explain the SQL I will run and provide the single-line SQL in the exact required format.",
