  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app and the mysql client (8.0.44) is installed. No local MySQL server is running, no credentials or config files were found, and you have not provided a database question or any connection details. Because there is no target database and no question, no SQL can be executed from this environment yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details (so I can run queries from this container):\n  - host (or IP)\n  - port (optional, default 3306)\n  - username\n  - password (or indicate that you prefer an interactive prompt)\n  - database name\n  - the precise question you want answered about the data (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\")\n\n  Once you provide those, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single one-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue iteratively until I can provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Keep credentials private and run introspection yourself, then paste outputs here:\n  - Run and paste the raw outputs of these commands on your MySQL server:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Tell me the precise question you want answered.\n\nNotes and examples for connecting from this container when you provide credentials:\n  - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n  - Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nIf you give connection details and the question, I will:\n  1) Explain my approach briefly.\n  2) Provide exactly one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute.\n  3) Parse the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the Final Answer array.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the requested information (credentials + question, or introspection outputs + question).",
