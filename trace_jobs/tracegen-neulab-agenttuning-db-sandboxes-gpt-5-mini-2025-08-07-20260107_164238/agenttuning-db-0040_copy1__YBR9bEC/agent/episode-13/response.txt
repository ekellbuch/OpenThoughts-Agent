  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app inside the container. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed and is available. There is no local MySQL server process, no credential files, and no environment variables exposing connection info. You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database) so no SQL can be executed against a target database yet. In short: environment ready for client connections, but no target or question provided.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide either (A) connection details for the target MySQL server plus the exact question you want answered, or (B) the raw outputs of introspection commands you run on your MySQL server. Please choose one of the options below and supply the requested information.\n\nOption A — Share connection details (so I can run queries from this container):\n  - host (or IP)\n  - port (optional, default 3306)\n  - username\n  - password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt)\n  - database name\n  - the precise question you want answered about the data (for example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\")\n\n  If you provide credentials I will:\n  1) Explain the SQL I will run to answer your question.\n  2) Provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (start with the line \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL code block in markdown containing the one-line SQL). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me.\n  3) Parse the output and either issue another single SQL statement if more work is needed or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection yourself; paste the raw outputs plus the question:\n  - Run and paste the outputs of:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Tell me the exact question you want answered.\n\nNotes and examples:\n  - Example mysql client invocations I would use from this container when credentials are provided:\n    - Non-interactive (password on cmdline): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n    - Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n  - When I provide an SQL operation it will follow your required format exactly: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown, and the SQL must be one line. I will only provide one SQL statement per round.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide the requested connection details or pasted introspection outputs plus the exact question. Once you do, I will explain the approach and emit the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run.",
