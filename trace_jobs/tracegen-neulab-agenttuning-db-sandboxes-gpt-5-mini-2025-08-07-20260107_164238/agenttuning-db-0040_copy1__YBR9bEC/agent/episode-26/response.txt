  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. I checked for a local server, sockets, credential files and environment variables and found none. No database question, connection details, or any database introspection output have been provided, so there is no target to run SQL against. Therefore no SQL has been executed and I cannot produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose one of two options. Tell me which you prefer and provide the requested information; I will then (1) explain the SQL I will run and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). Options:\n\nOption A — You provide connection details so I can connect from this container. Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you prefer an interactive prompt), database name, and the precise question you want answered (be specific about tables/columns/filters/ordering/limits). Example client invocations I will use if you supply credentials:\n  - Interactive prompt: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n  - Non-interactive (password on cmdline): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DBNAME -e \"SQL\"\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection locally, then paste the raw outputs here plus the precise question. Run these on your MySQL server and paste the exact terminal output:\n  1) SHOW DATABASES;\n  2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n  3) DESCRIBE your_table;  (for any table relevant to your question)\n\nOnce you provide either (A) credentials + question or (B) introspection outputs + question, I will explain the approach and produce the single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. I will wait for your choice and the required information.",
