  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app inside the container and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) has been installed. I checked for a local MySQL server, sockets, credential files, and relevant environment variables and found none. No database question, connection details, or introspection outputs have been provided, so there is currently no target database to query and no SQL has been executed. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server, but I need information from you to proceed.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of two options. Please provide one of the following so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container (preferred):\n  - Provide: host (hostname or IP), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), database name.\n  - Provide the precise question you want answered (be specific about tables, columns, filters, ordering, limits, date ranges, etc.).\n  - If you give credentials I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run to answer the question, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the leading line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing one-line SQL). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back to me; I will parse it and iterate until I can return the final answer.\n  - Example client invocations I would use from this container (replace placeholders):\n      mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DBNAME -e \"SQL\"\n      mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DBNAME   (prompts for password)\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection locally, then paste outputs here:\n  - Run and paste the exact raw outputs (copy/paste terminal text) of these commands on your MySQL server and tell me the precise question:\n      SHOW DATABASES;\n      USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n      DESCRIBE your_table;   (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Based on these outputs and your question I will craft and provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single one-line SQL code block) for you to run. After you paste the result I will parse it and continue iteratively until the final answer is ready.\n\nImportant: When I provide an operation it will follow your required format exactly: the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown with one-line SQL. I will only produce one SQL statement per round. When ready to finish I will provide:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply either (A) connection details + the exact question or (B) the raw introspection outputs + the exact question. After you do, I will explain the SQL I will run and emit the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to execute.",
