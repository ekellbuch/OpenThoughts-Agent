  "analysis": "I inspected the container and found no local MySQL server or credentials. I then installed the default MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) successfully. At this point the environment is prepared to connect to a MySQL server, but I do not have any connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor a question about the data to answer yet. No SQL has been executed against any database because there is nothing to connect to.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the database question and the connection details for the target MySQL server (at minimum: host, port (optional, default 3306), username, password, and database name). If you prefer to run locally against a socket, provide the socket path and user credentials. Once you provide the connection info and your question, I will:\n- Explain my approach to answer the question\n- Produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single SQL code block (Action: Operation with the SQL in markdown, one-line)\n- After you run that SQL and provide the MySQL output, I will parse the output and either (a) run another single SQL statement if more operations are needed, or (b) finalize with Action: Answer and the Final Answer array when confident\n\nIf you cannot or do not want to share credentials, you can paste the output of a SHOW TABLES or DESCRIBE result from your side and I will craft the next SQL. Tell me which database and table to target and the exact question (e.g., \"Give me the top 5 customers by revenue in 2025\").",
