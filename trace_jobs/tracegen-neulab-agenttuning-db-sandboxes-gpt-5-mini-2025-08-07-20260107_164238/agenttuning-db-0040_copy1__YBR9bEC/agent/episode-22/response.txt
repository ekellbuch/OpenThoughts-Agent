  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside the container. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running, there are no credential/config files or environment variables exposing connection details, and you have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database) or introspection outputs. No SQL has been executed because there is no target database or question to act on.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide either of the two options below. After you provide one of them and state the exact question you want answered, I will (1) explain my approach and the SQL I will run, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL in that first block and paste the raw MySQL output back to me; I will parse it and iterate until I can produce the final answer.\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (you provide credentials + question):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), database name.\n  - Provide the precise question to answer about the data (for example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").\n  - If you allow connection, I will connect using the mysql client and then produce the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection locally (then paste outputs + question):\n  - Run and paste raw outputs of these commands on your MySQL server: 1) SHOW DATABASES; 2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES; 3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question).\n  - Tell me the exact question you want answered. Based on those outputs I will craft the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run.\n\nSecurity note: If you provide credentials and prefer not to place the password on the command line, indicate that and I will use an interactive prompt (-p).",
