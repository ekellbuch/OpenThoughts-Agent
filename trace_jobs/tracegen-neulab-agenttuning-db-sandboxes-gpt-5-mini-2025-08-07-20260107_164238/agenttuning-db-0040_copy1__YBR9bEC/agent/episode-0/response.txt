  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt in a container/host (root@11a065181d07:/app#). No recent commands or MySQL queries have been run. There is no provided question yet about the database. To proceed we need to discover whether a MySQL server or client is present, whether a socket or network listener exists, and whether any local credentials or configuration files are available (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf or /var/lib/mysql). Once we locate the server and credentials (or confirm how to connect), we can run the SQL you request. Nothing has been accomplished yet toward connecting to MySQL.",
  "plan": "I will run a small set of commands to detect MySQL client/server presence and locate possible credentials or sockets so we can connect and execute SQL. Specifically:\n- whoami and pwd: confirm context and working directory.\n- ls -la: show files in current directory (/app) to see if any DB-related artifacts exist.\n- ps aux | grep -E 'mysql|mysqld' to check for running MySQL server processes.\n- ss -lntp to view listening TCP ports and associated processes (fallback to netstat if ss not available).\n- ls -la /var/lib/mysql to check for database files (if accessible).\n- cat /etc/mysql/debian.cnf to look for packaged maintenance user credentials (common in Debian-based images).\n- mysql --version to see if the mysql client is installed.\nThese commands will help determine how to connect. After that, I'll wait for your database question and/or the outputs, then prepare the single-line SQL statement (inside a single SQL code block) you want executed. Each command will be short and quick.",
