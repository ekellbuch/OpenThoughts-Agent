  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. I have checked for a local server, sockets, credential files (.my.cnf), and environment variables and found none. No database question, connection details, or any introspection outputs have been provided, so there is no target database to query. No SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you provide either Option A (credentials so I can connect from this container) or Option B (you run introspection on your DB and paste the raw outputs). Please choose one and provide the required items. Once provided I will (1) explain the approach for the requested question, and (2) supply exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). After you execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and either produce another single SQL statement or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and Final Answer.\n\nOption A — I connect from this container (preferred):\n- Provide: host (hostname or IP), port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the precise question to answer (be specific about tables/columns/filters/order/limit/date ranges). \n- Example one-shot client command I would use from this container (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DBNAME -e \"SQL\"\n  Or to be prompted for the password (safer):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p -D DBNAME\n- Security note: putting the password on the command line can be visible to other users; omit it to prompt interactively if preferred.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection yourself:\n- Run these commands on your MySQL server and paste the exact raw outputs here, plus the precise question you want answered:\n  1) SHOW DATABASES;\n  2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n  3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n\nOnce you provide Option A or Option B information and the exact question, I will (a) explain the SQL I'll run, and (b) produce the single-line SQL in the required \"Action: Operation\" format for you to execute.",
