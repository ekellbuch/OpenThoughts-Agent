  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. From the checks already run there is no MySQL server process running, no mysql client found, and no obvious /var/lib/mysql or Debian maintenance credentials. The environment currently lacks any discovered MySQL artifacts. Nothing has been accomplished toward executing SQL because I have not been given a database question yet and there is no obvious local MySQL server or client present to run queries against.",
  "plan": "I will look for any environment variables or local configuration files that could contain connection details (host, port, user, password, socket, .my.cnf, .cnf files). This will help determine whether a remote database is reachable or credentials exist in the container. If no credentials or client are present, we can either (a) install a mysql client here (if you permit) to connect to a remote MySQL server you provide, or (b) you can provide the database host, port, username, password, and database name so I can craft the SQL to run remotely. The next commands will: 1) print relevant environment variables, 2) check for a root .my.cnf file, 3) list /etc/mysql, and 4) search common paths for .cnf/.my.cnf files. These steps are quick and nondestructive and should reveal any stored credentials or socket paths.",
