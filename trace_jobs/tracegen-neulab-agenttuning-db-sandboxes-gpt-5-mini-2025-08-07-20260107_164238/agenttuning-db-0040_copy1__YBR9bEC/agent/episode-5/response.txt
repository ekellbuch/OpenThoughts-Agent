  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed and is ready to connect to a MySQL server, but no database question or connection details have been provided. I cannot run any SQL because there is no target server or credentials. Previously I checked for local MySQL artifacts (none found) and installed the mysql client successfully. No SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the database question you want answered and the connection details for the target MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, username, password, and database name), or alternatively paste outputs from any introspection commands you can run (for example: SHOW DATABASES; USE dbname; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE table; or SELECT samples). Once you provide the question and connection info (or introspection output) I will:\n\n1) Explain my approach to answering the question and what SQL I will run.\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown, the SQL must be one line). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) Parse the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement if further operations are necessary, or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and a Final Answer array when I'm certain.\n\nIf you want me to run the query from this container, give me the credentials. Example mysql client invocations you can run (replace placeholders):\n- Noninteractive (not recommended for passwords on command line): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n- Interactive password prompt: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nIf you prefer to run introspection yourself and paste results here, useful commands to run on your side are:\n- SHOW DATABASES;  (to list databases)\n- USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;  (to list tables in a DB)\n- DESCRIBE your_table;  (to show table columns)\n\nTell me the exact question (for example: \"Return the top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from table orders\"), and either provide credentials or paste the introspection outputs. Once you do that I'll prepare the single-line SQL statement exactly as required.",
