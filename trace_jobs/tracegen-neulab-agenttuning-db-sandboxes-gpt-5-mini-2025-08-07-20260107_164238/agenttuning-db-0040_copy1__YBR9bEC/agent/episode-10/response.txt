  "analysis": "The environment is a root shell in /app. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, no credential files, and no environment variables exposing connection information. You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database), so no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you either (A) provide connection details for the target MySQL server and the exact question you want answered, or (B) run introspection commands on your database and paste their outputs here. Choose one of the following options and respond:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details and question (I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format):\n  - host (or IP)\n  - port (optional, default 3306)\n  - username\n  - password (or indicate that you prefer an interactive prompt)\n  - database name\n  - the precise question (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\")\n\nIf you want me to connect from this container, I will run the mysql client like:\n  - Non-interactive (password on cmdline): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n  - Interactive prompt: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nOption B — You do not share credentials; instead run these commands on your MySQL server and paste raw outputs here, along with the precise question:\n  1) SHOW DATABASES;\n  2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n  3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any relevant table)\n\nAfter you provide either the connection details or the introspection outputs plus the exact question, I will:\n  1) Explain my approach and the SQL I will run.\n  2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block containing the one-line SQL). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return raw MySQL output.\n  3) Parse the output and either issue another single SQL statement if required or finish with Action: Answer and the Final Answer array.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the requested information so I can continue.",
