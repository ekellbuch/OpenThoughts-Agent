  "analysis": "The container now has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is still no local MySQL server or discovered credentials. I cannot run any SQL yet because you haven't provided a database question or connection details. The environment is ready to connect to a remote MySQL server if you supply host, port (optional), username, password, and database name, or you can run client commands locally and paste outputs for me to act on.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide: (1) the question you want answered about the database (be specific), and (2) connection details (host, port if not 3306, username, password, database name) OR paste the outputs from any database introspection commands you can run (for example: SHOW DATABASES; USE dbname; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE table; SELECT ...). Once you provide the question and credentials (or the introspection outputs), I will:\n- Explain how I'll solve the question and the SQL I will run.\n- Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block in markdown on one line). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n- Parse the output and either (a) produce another single SQL statement if more operations are needed, or (b) finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer when certain.\n\nIf you want to connect from this container yourself, an example mysql client command (fill in values) is:\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n\nIf you prefer to be prompted for a password instead of putting it on the command line, omit PASSWORD (use -p) and you'll be asked interactively:\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nAfter you provide the question and credentials (or paste database outputs), I will prepare the single-line SQL to run next.",
