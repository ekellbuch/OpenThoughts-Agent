  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside the container. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and available. There is no local MySQL server running and no credentials or config files were found. You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database), so no SQL can be executed against any target. Previously I inspected the environment and installed the mysql client; nothing further has been accomplished because there is no target database or question.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run SQL until you provide either:\n\nOption A — Connection details so I can run queries from this container:\n  - host (or IP)\n  - port (optional, default 3306)\n  - username\n  - password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt)\n  - database name\n  - the precise question you want answered about the data (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\")\n\nIf you provide credentials and permit me to connect, I will:\n  1) Explain the SQL I will run to answer your question.\n  2) Output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output here.\n  3) Parse the output and either provide another single SQL statement if needed or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection yourself; paste raw outputs and the question:\n  - Run and paste these raw outputs from your MySQL server:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Tell me the precise question you want answered.\n\nOnce you provide either the connection details + question (Option A) or the introspection outputs + question (Option B), I will (a) explain the approach, and (b) produce the single-line SQL statement in the required \"Action: Operation\" format for you to execute. Please indicate which option you choose and supply the requested information.",
