  "analysis": "The container is ready: you're at root@11a065181d07:/app# and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed. I previously checked and there is no local MySQL server process, no credential files (.my.cnf) or environment variables exposing connection info. No database question, connection details, or introspection outputs have been provided, so I cannot run any SQL against a target database yet. In short: environment prepared for client connections, but there is no target or query to execute.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide one of two things so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Give connection details so I can connect from this container (preferred):\n  - Supply: host (or IP), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), and database name.\n  - Also give the precise question you want answered (be specific about which tables/columns, expected output, ordering, limits, date ranges, etc.).\n  - If you provide credentials I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run to answer the question, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will parse it and iterate until I can return the final answer.\n\nOption B — Keep credentials private and run introspection yourself (then paste outputs here):\n  - Run and paste the raw outputs of these commands on your MySQL server and tell me the exact question:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Based on those outputs I will craft and provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single one-line SQL code block) for you to run and return results; I will continue iteratively until I can provide the final answer.\n\nHelpful example commands you can run here in the container when you provide credentials (replace placeholders):\n  - Interactive password prompt (safer): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p DBNAME\n  - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n  - Run a single statement from the shell and exit (change HOST/PORT/USER/PASS/DB): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DBNAME -e \"SHOW TABLES;\"\n\nIf you choose Option B and will run introspection on your side, here are exact commands to copy/paste on your MySQL server (replace DBNAME/TABLENAME):\n  - SHOW DATABASES;\n  - USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n  - DESCRIBE your_table;\n\nSecurity note: Avoid pasting passwords in public chat. If you provide credentials and want me to connect from this container, you can omit the password to be prompted interactively (-p) or provide it if you accept the risk.\n\nAlso remember the SQL exchange rules you requested: when I provide an operation it must follow the exact format \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block (in markdown) with one-line SQL; you will run only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output. When I'm ready to finalize the answer I will use \"Action: Answer\" and provide Final Answer: [ ... ].\n\nPlease reply with either Option A (connection details + precise question) or Option B (paste the raw outputs of the introspection commands above plus the precise question). Once you do, I will explain the approach and produce the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) to run.",
