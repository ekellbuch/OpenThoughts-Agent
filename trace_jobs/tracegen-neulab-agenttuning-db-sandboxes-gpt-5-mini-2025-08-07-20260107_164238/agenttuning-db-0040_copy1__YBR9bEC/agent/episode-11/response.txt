  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app. The mysql client (8.0.44) is installed in the container. There is no local MySQL server process running and no credential/configuration files were found. I have not been given a database question or any connection details (host, port, username, password, database), so no SQL has been executed and there is no target to query yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you provide either (A) connection details for the target MySQL server plus the exact question you want answered, or (B) the raw outputs of introspection commands you've run on your server (so I can craft SQL without direct access). Choose one of these options and supply the requested information:\n\nOption A — Provide credentials and question:\n  - host (or IP)\n  - port (optional, default 3306)\n  - username\n  - password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt)\n  - database name\n  - the precise question to answer about the data (e.g., \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from table orders\")\n\n  If you give credentials and permit me to run queries from this container, I will:\n  1) Explain the approach and the specific SQL I will run.\n  2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with the line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL code block in markdown with a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and paste the raw MySQL output here.\n  3) Parse the output and either provide another single SQL statement or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — You run introspection locally and paste outputs plus the question (if you do not want to share credentials):\n  - Run and paste the raw outputs of these commands on your MySQL server (no need to redact anything unless you want to):\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for any table relevant to your question)\n  - Tell me the precise question you want answered.\n\nNotes on how I will invoke the client from this container when credentials are provided:\n  - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n  - Interactive password prompt: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nSecurity note: putting passwords on the command line can be visible to other users on the system; if you prefer, omit the password to be prompted interactively.\n\nOnce you provide either credentials + question (Option A) or introspection outputs + question (Option B), I will (1) explain the SQL I'll use and why, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required \"Action: Operation\" single code block format for you to run. After you paste the mysql output back, I'll continue until I can produce the final answer.",
