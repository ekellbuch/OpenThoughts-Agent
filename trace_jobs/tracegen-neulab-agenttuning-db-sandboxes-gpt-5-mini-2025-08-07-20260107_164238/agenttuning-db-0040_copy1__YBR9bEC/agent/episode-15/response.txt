  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside the container. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) was installed successfully. There is no local MySQL server process running, no credential files (.my.cnf or /etc/mysql with creds) were found, and no environment variables exposing DB connection details are present. Because no target database, credentials, or question have been provided, no SQL has been or can be executed from this environment yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you provide either (A) connection details for the target MySQL server so I can connect from this container, or (B) the raw outputs of introspection commands you run on your MySQL server (if you prefer not to share credentials). After you supply one of these, I will explain the approach and produce exactly one SQL statement (per your rules) for you to execute. Details:\n\nOption A — You provide connection details and the question\n  - Required: host (IP or hostname), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name. Port if not 3306.\n  - Also tell me the precise question you want answered (for example: \"Top 5 customers by revenue in 2025 from orders table\").\n  - If you permit me to run queries from this container I will:\n    1) Connect with the mysql client (example non-interactive: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME; or interactive: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p DBNAME).\n    2) Explain the SQL I plan to run to answer your question.\n    3) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single markdown SQL code block with a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n    4) Parse the returned output and either issue another single SQL statement if more work is needed or finish with Action: Answer and Final Answer.\n\nOption B — You keep credentials private and run introspection yourself\n  - Run these commands on your MySQL server and paste the raw outputs here, along with the precise question:\n    1) SHOW DATABASES;\n    2) USE your_db; SHOW TABLES;\n    3) DESCRIBE your_table; (for tables relevant to the question)\n  - Based on those outputs and your question I will craft the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run and return results.\n\nExamples of the mysql client invocations I would use from this container when credentials are provided:\n  - Non-interactive (password on command line): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -pPASSWORD DBNAME\n  - Interactive prompt for password: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p DBNAME\n\nNext step (what I need from you): choose Option A or B and either supply connection details + the exact question, or paste the raw introspection outputs plus the exact question. Once you do, I will explain the SQL I will run and then provide the single-line SQL statement in the required \"Action: Operation\" format for you to execute.",
