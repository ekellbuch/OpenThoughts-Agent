To help you decide, here are common options you can request (pick one):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- List tables via information_schema: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db';\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n\nWhen you tell me which question to run, I will (1) explain my reasoning and (2) provide exactly one Action: Operation containing a single SQL statement (one line) in a code block for you to execute. If I can determine the final answer without running SQL, I will instead provide Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer array. Tell me which query or question you want me to run next (and the target database/table if applicable).",
