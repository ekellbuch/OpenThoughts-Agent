Per your rules I'll provide an Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block; that SQL will be executed via the mysql client. The SQL to run is:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT User,Host,authentication_string,plugin FROM mysql.user;\n```\nThis will return a list of user accounts, their hosts, and authentication details. After you run it and return the output I will analyze and explain the results and propose next steps (e.g., create/modify users or query application databases if present).",
