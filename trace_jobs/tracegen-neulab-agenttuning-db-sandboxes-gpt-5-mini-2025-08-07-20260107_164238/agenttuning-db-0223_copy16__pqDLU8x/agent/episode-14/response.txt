To help you choose, pick one of the following options (or provide a custom question):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- List tables via information_schema: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db';\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n\nWhen you tell me which one you want (and provide the target database/table if applicable), I will: 1) explain my reasoning, and 2) provide exactly one Action: Operation containing a single one-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute. If I can determine the final answer without running SQL I will instead provide Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer array.",
