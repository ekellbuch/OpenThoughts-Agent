  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running. We inspected mysql.user and saw root@localhost uses auth_socket, and earlier SHOW DATABASES returned only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). It's unclear whether any non-system (application) databases exist; SHOW DATABASES earlier didn't show any. To discover whether there are any application schemas and what tables they contain, we should query information_schema for tables outside the system schemas.",
  "plan": "I'll run a single discovery SQL statement that lists all tables in all schemas except the system schemas (mysql, information_schema, performance_schema, sys). This will show any application databases and their tables so we can decide the next targeted queries. Per your operation rules, this is an Action: Operation and the SQL is provided below.\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','information_schema','performance_schema','sys') ORDER BY table_schema,table_name;\n```\nI expect this to return zero rows if there are no application databases, or a list of schema.table pairs if application data exists. After you run it and return the output, I'll analyze and propose the next step.",
