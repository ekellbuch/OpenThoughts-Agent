No user/application databases or tables have been inspected yet. You have not provided a specific question to answer about the database.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific question you want answered about the database (examples: list tables in a database, show rows from a table matching a condition, count rows, join tables, etc.). If you don't know the database or table names I can run diagnostic SQL to discover them (e.g., list databases, list tables in a database). Per your rules, in each round I may either (A) operate by providing exactly one SQL statement in a code block (Action: Operation) which you will execute and return the output, or (B) if I can be certain of the final answer without running SQL, provide an Action: Answer with the final Answer array. Please tell me which question you want answered, or tell me which diagnostic SQL you'd like me to run next (for example: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; or SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='mysql';). I will then explain my reasoning and either provide the single SQL statement to execute or the final answer.",
