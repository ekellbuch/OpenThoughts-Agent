If you don't know what to ask, pick one of these diagnostic queries and tell me which one to run:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- List tables via information_schema: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db';\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n\nTell me which of the above (or a custom question) you want me to run next. I will then provide the single SQL statement to execute.",
