  "plan": "1) Check whether a mysqld process is already running and whether the socket directory exists. 2) If no server is running, install the default MySQL server package so the server is installed and (if possible) started/initialized by the package scripts. 3) Try to start the server via the service/init script if the package doesn't start it automatically. 4) After the server is up (socket exists), run a single SQL statement to list databases (SHOW DATABASES;) to confirm connectivity. The commands will: (a) inspect running processes and socket directory, (b) install default-mysql-server, (c) attempt to start the server, (d) run mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to verify.",
