  "plan": "I need you to tell me the specific question you want answered about the database (for example: list tables in a particular database, count rows in a table, find rows matching a condition, join tables, etc.). Once you give the question I will: 1) think through how to answer it and explain my reasoning; 2) either perform one SQL operation (Action: Operation) by providing exactly one SQL statement in a single markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output to me), or, if I can be certain of the final answer without running SQL, provide (Action: Answer) with the exact final Answer array. Please state the database and table names if known; if you don't know them I can start by listing databases or tables, but remember I may only request one SQL statement per round. Right now I will wait for your question or for permission to run a diagnostic SQL (e.g., list tables in a chosen database).",
