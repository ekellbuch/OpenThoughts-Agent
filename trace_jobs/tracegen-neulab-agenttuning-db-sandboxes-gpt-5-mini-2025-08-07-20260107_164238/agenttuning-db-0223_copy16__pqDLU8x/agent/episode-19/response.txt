The server is running and responsive (earlier SHOW TABLES worked). It's possible the previous query returned rows but the output wasn't visible in the terminal capture, or the authentication_string is empty causing confusion. To be certain of account entries and to show clearly when authentication_string is empty, I'll re-run a single SELECT that replaces empty authentication_string values with a visible marker.",
  "plan": "Run one SQL statement that lists mysql.user accounts, their hosts, plugin, and an explicit marker '(empty)' when authentication_string is empty. This will make it clear which users exist and which have no password set. Per the operation rules I will provide the Action: Operation block with exactly one SQL statement. After you execute it and supply the output, I'll analyze the accounts and recommend next steps (e.g., set root password, create users, or query other databases).",
