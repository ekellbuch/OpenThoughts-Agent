To proceed, tell me one clear request from the options below (or provide a custom question):\n- List databases (SHOW DATABASES;)\n- List tables in a particular database (SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;)\n- List tables via information_schema (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db';)\n- Describe a table's columns (DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;)\n- Show rows from a table (SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;)\n- Count rows in a table (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;)\n- Any other SQL you need (specify schema/table/condition)\n\nWhen you pick one, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the SQL I plan to run, and 2) provide exactly one Action: Operation containing a single SQL statement (one-line, in a markdown SQL code block) for you to execute. If I can determine the final answer without running SQL I will instead provide Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer array.",
