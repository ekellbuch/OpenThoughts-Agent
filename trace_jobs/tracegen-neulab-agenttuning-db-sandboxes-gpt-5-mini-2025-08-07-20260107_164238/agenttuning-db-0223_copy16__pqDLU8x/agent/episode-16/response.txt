  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). You have not specified a particular question about the database, so I'll perform a safe discovery step to inspect the tables in the 'mysql' system database (this often reveals user and privilege-related tables). No user/application databases have been inspected yet.",
  "plan": "I will run a single SQL statement to list tables in the mysql schema so we can see what system tables exist (and possibly user account information). According to your rules I'm providing an Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement (in the first SQL code block). The SQL to execute is:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n```\nThis will return the list of tables in the 'mysql' database. After you run it and return the output, I'll analyze those tables and propose the next query or final answer.",
