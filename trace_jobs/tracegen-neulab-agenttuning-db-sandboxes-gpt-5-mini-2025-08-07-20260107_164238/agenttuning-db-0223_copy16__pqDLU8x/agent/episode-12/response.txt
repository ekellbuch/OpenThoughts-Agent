I verified connectivity earlier with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned only the system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys.

  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me exactly what you want inspected or queried. Please choose one clear request (or provide a custom question). Examples:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- List tables via information_schema: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db';\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n\nOnce you pick one, I will (1) explain my reasoning and (2) provide exactly one Action: Operation containing a single SQL statement in a one-line SQL code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output). If I can determine the final answer without running SQL I will instead provide Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer array. Tell me which query or question to run next and the target database/table if applicable.",
