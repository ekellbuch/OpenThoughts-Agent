  "analysis": "The MySQL server has been installed and is currently running intermittently (logs show mysqld was killed and restarted several times). We previously listed system tables in the 'mysql' schema and inspected mysql.user (root uses auth_socket). A prior attempt to query information_schema for non-system tables failed due to a transient socket error; subsequent restarts appear to have restored the server. To determine whether any non-system (application) databases exist, we should list databases again now that the server is up.",
  "plan": "Run a single SQL discovery query to list all databases (SHOW DATABASES;) to confirm whether any user/application databases exist beyond the system schemas. This is an Action: Operation. The SQL to run is:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n```\nI expect this to return the list of databases (system schemas plus any application databases if present). Based on the result we can either list tables in a found database or conclude there are no application databases.",
