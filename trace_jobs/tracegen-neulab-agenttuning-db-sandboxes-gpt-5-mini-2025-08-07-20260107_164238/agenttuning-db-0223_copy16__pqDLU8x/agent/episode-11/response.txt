Pick one clear request (or provide a custom question):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a particular database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- List tables via information_schema: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db';\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n- Any other SQL you need (specify schema/table/condition)\n\nOnce you tell me which of the above (or provide a custom question), I will: 1) explain my reasoning and the exact SQL I will run, and 2) provide a single Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement (one-line) for you to execute. If I can deduce the final answer without running SQL I will instead provide Action: Answer with the exact Final Answer array.",
