  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question you want answered about the database (examples: list tables in a particular database, show rows from a table that match a condition, count rows in a table, run a join, etc.). If you don't know database/table names I can run a discovery query (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; or SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='<db>';). Per your rules, once you give the question I'll (1) explain my reasoning, then (2) either provide a single SQL statement in an Action: Operation block for you to execute, or (3) if I can be certain of the final answer without executing SQL, provide Action: Answer with the exact final Answer array. Tell me which question or which discovery query you'd like me to run next.",
