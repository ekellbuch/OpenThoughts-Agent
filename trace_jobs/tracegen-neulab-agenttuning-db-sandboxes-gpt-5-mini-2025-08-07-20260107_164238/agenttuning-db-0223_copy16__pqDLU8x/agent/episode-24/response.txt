  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running. I verified connectivity and listed databases: only system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). I inspected mysql.user and found root@localhost authenticates with auth_socket (no password), and several internal system accounts (debian-sys-maint, mysql.session, mysql.sys, mysql.infoschema) use caching_sha2_password. A discovery query for non-system tables returned no rows (no application databases detected). The server has been intermittently restarted in the logs but is currently up and responding to queries.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me precisely what you want to do next with the database. Possible next actions (pick one):\n- Inspect databases again: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- List all non-system tables: SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','information_schema','performance_schema','sys');\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Create user / change root auth (I will provide exact ALTER/CREATE SQL if you choose this).\n\nWhen you pick one action, I will: (1) explain my reasoning for that choice, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (a single SQL statement in a single SQL code block) for you to execute. If you prefer, I can also proceed with a shell-side diagnostic command before running SQL, but per your rule each SQL operation must be a single statement and will be executed by you and its raw output returned to me.",
