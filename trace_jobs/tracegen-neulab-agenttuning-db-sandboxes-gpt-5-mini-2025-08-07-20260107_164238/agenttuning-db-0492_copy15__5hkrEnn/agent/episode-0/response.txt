  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app and no MySQL-related actions have been taken yet. The environment shows a bare prompt with no job control messages; no databases or SQL have been queried. To answer future SQL questions I need to locate a MySQL/MariaDB server and client, determine accessible credentials (if any), and then run the user's requested SQL. Right now we don't know whether the mysql client is installed, whether a server is running, or if there are credentials stored (e.g., /root/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/debian.cnf).",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary is available (which mysql) and its version. 2) Check whether a MySQL/MariaDB server process is running. 3) Inspect common socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) to see if a server socket exists. 4) Look for stored credentials in /root/.my.cnf and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf so we can connect non-interactively if a password is required. After these checks, I'll know how to connect and will ask you (or proceed) to run the specific SQL you request.\n\nCommands to run and reasons:\n- which mysql -> quickly tell if mysql client exists.\n- mysql --version -> client version (useful to choose client flags).\n- ps aux | grep -E 'mysql|mariadb' | grep -v grep -> check for running server processes.\n- ls -la /var/run/mysqld -> look for mysqld.sock or socket files used to connect locally.\n- ls -la /root/.my.cnf -> check for per-root stored credentials.\n- cat /etc/mysql/debian.cnf -> Debian/Ubuntu packaged MySQL often stores maintenance credentials here; useful to connect if present.",
