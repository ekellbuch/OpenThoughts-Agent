  "analysis": "From the previous checks: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no MySQL/MariaDB server process is running, and there are no local socket or credential files (/var/run/mysqld, /root/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/debian.cnf do not exist). In short: there is currently no local MySQL client or server available to run SQL. To proceed I need a MySQL client installed (or access to a remote server), and connection credentials (host, port, user, password or socket).",
  "plan": "1) Detect the OS / package manager so we can install a MySQL client package. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client or the distro equivalent) so we can run SQL. 3) Verify the client was installed successfully. After that, I will ask you for the database connection details (host, port/socket, user, password, database) or proceed to run SQL you provide.\n\nCommands to be run:\n- Inspect /etc/os-release to detect distribution.\n- Check availability of common package managers (apt-get, apk, yum).\n- If apt-get exists, run apt-get update and install default-mysql-client.\n- Verify mysql client is present and print its version.",
