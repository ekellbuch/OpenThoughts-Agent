  "analysis": "From the diagnostics you ran: the container is a minimal environment (/app is empty). There is no MySQL server process running, no MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql doesn't exist), and the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). There is no MySQL configuration file at /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and no environment variables referencing MySQL. In short: there is currently no local MySQL client/server available to run SQL against inside this container.",
  "plan": "To be able to run SQL statements from this shell I will install a MySQL client. I will: 1) update apt package lists, 2) install the default MySQL client package, 3) verify the 'mysql' client is available and show its version. Once the client is available I can connect to a MySQL server if you provide connection credentials (host, port, user, password, database) or if a local server is started. If apt is unavailable or the install fails, I'll report the error and propose alternatives (install mariadb-client or ask you to provide connection details to an external DB).",
