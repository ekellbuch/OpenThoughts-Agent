  "analysis": "You are in a shell at root@b6b1de0722f2:/app#. No previous MySQL commands have been run. The terminal shows a normal container shell with no job control messages. There is no information yet about whether MySQL server or client is installed, which databases exist, or connection parameters. Before executing any SQL, I need to discover if a MySQL server is running in the container, whether the mysql client is available, and where database files or configuration live. That will let me form the correct SQL connection and queries when you ask your specific question.",
  "plan": "I'll run a sequence of lightweight diagnostic commands to determine: current user and directory, files in the current directory, running processes (to see if mysqld is running), whether the mysql client is installed and its version, presence of MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql), whether port 3306 is listening, environment variables that mention MySQL, and the MySQL config if present. Based on the outputs you return, I'll proceed to connect or ask you for connection details. The commands are ordered from cheap to slightly more detailed checks.",
