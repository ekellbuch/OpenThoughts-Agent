  "analysis": "MariaDB 10.11.13 is installed and running in this container (started via mysqld_safe). The mysql client is present and root@localhost can connect without a password. Only system databases exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The mysql.user table shows accounts mariadb.sys, mysql, and root (all@localhost) and root has ALL PRIVILEGES with GRANT OPTION. No non-system/application databases or tables are present. I have not executed any application-specific SQL because you have not asked a specific question or requested a particular SQL operation yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly one SQL action to perform next. Per your rules I can execute only one SQL statement per round. Pick one precise action (or provide an exact SQL statement) from the examples below or give your own single SQL statement. When you choose, I will: (1) briefly explain what the SQL will do, and (2) provide the single SQL statement formatted as required (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). Example actions you can pick from: \n\n- Show server version: SELECT @@version;\n- List accounts: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for root: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Show grants for current user: SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER();\n- Inspect root's mysql.user row: SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost'\\G\n- List any non-system tables: SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Create a database: CREATE DATABASE test_db;\n- Create a table: CREATE TABLE test_db.t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));\n- Insert a row: INSERT INTO test_db.t1 (id,name) VALUES (1,'alice');\n- Create a user: CREATE USER 'alice'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n- Change root password: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPass';\n\nTell me exactly which single SQL statement you want me to run (copy one of the above or provide another exact SQL). I will then output the required Action: Operation block containing that single-line SQL statement for you to execute, and after you provide the raw MySQL output I will interpret it and continue.",
