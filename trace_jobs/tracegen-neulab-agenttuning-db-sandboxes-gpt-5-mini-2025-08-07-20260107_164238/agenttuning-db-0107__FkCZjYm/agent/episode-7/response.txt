  "analysis": "MariaDB (mariadbd) is installed and running in this container (started via mysqld_safe). The mysql client is available and connects as root without a password from localhost. Current databases are only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user/application databases or tables present (a previous query against information_schema returned no non-system tables). The mysql.user table shows accounts mariadb.sys, root, and mysql using mysql_native_password. No further SQL has been executed because you have not yet specified the question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the exact question or operation you want performed. Please choose one precise action from the options below (or give another precise request):\n- Inspect server info (e.g., SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'; or SELECT @@version;)\n- Inspect users or privileges (e.g., SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; or SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';)\n- Create a database/table and insert sample data (e.g., CREATE DATABASE test; CREATE TABLE test.t1(...); INSERT INTO test.t1 ...;)\n- Query a specific table (you must name schema.table)\n\nOnce you pick one action, I will: (1) explain exactly what I will fetch or modify, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and either finish with Action: Answer or provide the next single SQL statement. Tell me which action you want me to perform next.",
