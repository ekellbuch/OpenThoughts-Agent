Examples you can choose from (or provide your own exact SQL):\n- Show server version: SELECT @@version;\n- List accounts: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for root: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Inspect root's mysql.user row: SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost'\\G\n- List non-system tables: SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Create a database: CREATE DATABASE test_db;\n- Create a table: CREATE TABLE test_db.t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));\n- Insert a row: INSERT INTO test_db.t1 (id,name) VALUES (1,'alice');\n- Create a new user: CREATE USER 'alice'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n- Change root password: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPass';\n\nWhen you pick exactly one of the above (or provide another single SQL statement), I will:\n1) Briefly explain what that SQL will do, and\n2) Output the single SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block).",
