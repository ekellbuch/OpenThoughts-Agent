There are no application/user databases or tables (a previous query against information_schema returned no non-system tables). The mysql.user table contains accounts mariadb.sys, root, and mysql using mysql_native_password; the authentication_string values are empty or 'invalid', but root connects locally.

You will execute that statement and give me the raw MySQL output.\n3) Based on the output, I will interpret the results and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nPlease tell me which operation or question you want me to perform next (be specific).",
