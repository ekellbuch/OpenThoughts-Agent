The mysql client is available and root@localhost can connect without a password. Current databases are only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no non-system/application databases or tables. The mysql.user table contains accounts mariadb.sys, mysql, and root (all@localhost) and root has ALL PRIVILEGES WITH GRANT OPTION.

Pick one precise SQL statement from these examples (or provide another exact single-line SQL statement):\n\n- Inspect server version: SELECT @@version;\n- List accounts: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for root: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Show grants for current user: SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER();\n- Inspect root's mysql.user row: SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost'\\G\n- List non-system tables: SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Create a database: CREATE DATABASE test_db;\n- Create a table: CREATE TABLE test_db.t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));\n- Insert a row: INSERT INTO test_db.t1 (id,name) VALUES (1,'alice');\n- Create a user: CREATE USER 'alice'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n- Change root password: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPass';\n\nWhen you choose exactly one of the above (or provide another exact single SQL statement), I will:\n1) briefly explain what the SQL will do, and\n2) output the single SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and continue.\n\nTell me which single SQL statement you want me to run next.",
