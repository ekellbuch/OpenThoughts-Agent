A previous non-interactive query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned four databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The MariaDB server was started with mysqld_safe and root can connect without a password. We can now inspect available schemas, tables, and users to prepare for answering SQL questions.",
  "plan": "I'll run a few short MySQL client commands to confirm the current schema and user state: 1) repeat SHOW DATABASES to confirm availability, 2) list tables in the mysql system database, 3) list root/other users from mysql.user, and 4) check whether there are any non-system databases/tables (to find application data). Each command is non-interactive and prints results for the next step.",
