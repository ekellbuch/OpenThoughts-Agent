  "analysis": "I inspected the container and installed MariaDB. The server is running (started via mysqld_safe) and the mysql client is available. A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. A query of mysql.user shows three accounts (mariadb.sys, root, mysql) using the mysql_native_password plugin; the authentication_string values are empty or 'invalid', but the root user is currently able to connect without a password from localhost (that's how we ran the queries). I also queried information_schema.tables for non-system schemas and got no rows — there are currently no application/user databases or tables present.",
  "plan": "I will not run further SQL until you tell me the specific question you want answered. Before running any SQL I want to confirm your goal so I run only the single SQL statement per round as required. Options you can choose from:\n- Ask a question about the current server (examples: list users, check privileges, show server version). I will then run one SQL statement to retrieve that information and explain the result. \n- If you want data to query, instruct me to create a database/table and insert sample rows; I will run the CREATE/INSERT as the single SQL operation in the next round and then continue querying in subsequent rounds.\n- If you want me to inspect a specific system table (for example, mysql.user privileges, or SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';), tell me which and I'll execute one SQL statement to fetch it.\nTell me which of the above (or an alternative) you want me to do next. Once you specify, I will: (1) explain what I will fetch, (2) run exactly one SQL statement (sent via the mysql client), and (3) interpret the returned output you provide.",
