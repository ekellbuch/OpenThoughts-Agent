  "analysis": "MariaDB (mariadbd) is installed and running in this container (started with mysqld_safe). The mysql client is available and connects as root without a password from localhost. Current databases are only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no non-system/application databases or tables present. I have not executed any further SQL because you have not specified the exact single SQL statement you want run next (per your rule: only one SQL statement will be executed each round and it must be provided in the required format).",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify one exact SQL action to perform. Please tell me which single SQL statement you want me to run next. Examples you can pick (or provide another precise statement):\n- Inspect server version: run SELECT @@version;  (returns server version string)\n- List users: run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;  (lists accounts)\n- Show grants for root: run SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';  (shows privileges)\n- List non-system tables: run SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');  (shows any user databases/tables)\n- Create a test DB/table and insert rows: e.g., CREATE DATABASE test; or CREATE TABLE test.t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50)); INSERT INTO test.t1 (id,name) VALUES (1,'a');\n\nWhen you pick one exact action, I will: 1) explain briefly what that SQL will do, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). Execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and continue.",
