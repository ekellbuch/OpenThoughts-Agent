  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in a container with MariaDB installed and running (started with mysqld_safe). The mysql client is present and root@localhost can connect without a password. Only the default system schemas exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no non-system/application databases or tables. I have not run any further SQL because you have not specified the specific question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give a single, exact SQL action to perform (per your rules only one SQL statement is executed per round). Please tell me precisely which single operation you want next. Examples you can choose from (or provide another precise SQL statement):\n- Inspect server version: I'll run SELECT @@version; to get the server version string.\n- List accounts: I'll run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; to list MySQL users and hosts.\n- Show privileges for root: I'll run SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; to see root's grants.\n- List non-system tables: I'll run SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys'); to find any user databases/tables.\n- Create test data: give me database/table/columns and I'll run a CREATE or INSERT statement you specify.\n\nWhen you pick one exact action, I will (1) briefly explain what I will do, and (2) provide a single SQL statement formatted per your rules (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). You will execute that single statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and proceed.",
