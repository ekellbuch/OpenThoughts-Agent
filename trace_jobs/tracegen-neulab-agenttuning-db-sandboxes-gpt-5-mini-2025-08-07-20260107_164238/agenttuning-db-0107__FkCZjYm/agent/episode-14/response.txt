Please tell me exactly one of the following (or provide another precise SQL statement):\n- Inspect server/version info, e.g. run SELECT @@version;  \n- List accounts, e.g. run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;  \n- Show grants for root, e.g. run SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';  \n- List non-system tables, e.g. run SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');  \n- Create a database/table and insert rows (specify names and columns).\n\nWhen you pick one exact action, I will: (1) briefly explain what the SQL will do, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and continue. I will not run any commands until you specify the single SQL statement to execute.",
