Current databases are only the system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no non-system databases or tables present.

Please tell me one precise request (pick one):\n- Inspect server info: for example, run SELECT @@version; or SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%';\n- Inspect users/privileges: for example, run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; or SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Create schema/data: for example, CREATE DATABASE test; CREATE TABLE test.t1(...); INSERT INTO test.t1 ...;\n- Query a specific table (provide schema.table name)\n\nWhen you specify the desired action, I will: (1) briefly explain what I will retrieve or modify, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will interpret it and continue.",
