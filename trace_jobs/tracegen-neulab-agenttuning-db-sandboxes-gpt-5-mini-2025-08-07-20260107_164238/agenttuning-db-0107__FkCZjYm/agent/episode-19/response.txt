  "analysis": "You successfully listed MySQL accounts: mariadb.sys, mysql, and root — all limited to host 'localhost'. MariaDB is running and root can connect without a password. We do not yet know the exact privileges granted to root (e.g., whether it has ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION, or limited rights), which is useful to determine what operations we can perform next.",
  "plan": "Run a single SQL statement to show the grants for root@localhost so we can see its effective privileges. I will run: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; — this will return all GRANT statements that describe root's privileges. After you run it and provide the output, I'll interpret the privileges and propose the next SQL action or produce a final answer if that satisfies your question.",
