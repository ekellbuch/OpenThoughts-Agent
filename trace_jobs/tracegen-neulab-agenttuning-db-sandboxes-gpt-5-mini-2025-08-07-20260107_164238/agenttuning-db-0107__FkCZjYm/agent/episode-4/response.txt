  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in this container (started with mysqld_safe). The mysql client is available and connecting as root without a password from localhost. Current databases are only the system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user/application databases or tables (a query against information_schema returned no non-system tables). The mysql.user table shows accounts mariadb.sys, root, and mysql using mysql_native_password; the authentication_string values are empty/'invalid' but root can connect locally (likely because the server allows socket or empty-password local auth for root in this environment).",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what SQL action or question you want me to perform next. Options (pick one or describe another):\n- Inspect server state: e.g., SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'; or SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; or SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Create schema/data: e.g., CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE and INSERT rows so we can run queries against them.\n- Query application data (if you tell me the database/table names).\n\nWhen you specify the desired operation, I will: (1) explain exactly what I will retrieve or modify, (2) output a single SQL statement (in the required one-line markdown SQL block) as an Action: Operation, and (3) after you run it and provide the raw MySQL output, I will interpret the result and either finish with Action: Answer or issue another single SQL statement. For now I will not run any SQL until you specify which action you want.",
