Current databases are only the default system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user/application databases or tables present (a previous query against information_schema returned no non-system tables). I have not run any application-specific SQL because you have not yet specified what you want queried or changed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact single SQL action you want me to perform next. Per your rules I will: 1) briefly explain what that SQL will do, and 2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). Pick one precise action from these examples or provide another precise request:\n\n- Inspect server/version info: run SELECT @@version; (returns server version).\n- Inspect users: run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; (lists accounts).\n- Inspect privileges for root: run SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- List all non-system tables: run SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Create a test database/table and insert sample data (give names and columns you want).\n\nTell me which of the above (or another precise SQL statement) you want me to run. After you confirm, I will provide the single SQL statement (Action: Operation ...). I will not run any SQL until you pick one.",
