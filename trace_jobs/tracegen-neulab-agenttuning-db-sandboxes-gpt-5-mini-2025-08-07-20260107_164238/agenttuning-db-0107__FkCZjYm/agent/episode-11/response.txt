Please tell me exactly one SQL action to perform (pick one precise statement), for example:\n- Inspect server version: run SELECT @@version;\n- List users: run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for root: run SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- List non-system tables: run SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Or create a database/table and insert rows (specify names and columns).\n\nWhen you specify one exact action, I will: (1) briefly explain what I'll fetch or modify, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and continue.",
