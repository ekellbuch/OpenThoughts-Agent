Current databases are only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no non-system databases or tables present. I have not executed any application-specific SQL because you have not specified the question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify exactly which single SQL action you want me to run next. Options include (pick one or provide another precise request):\n- Inspect server info (e.g., SELECT @@version; or SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%';)\n- Inspect users/privileges (e.g., SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; or SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';)\n- Create a database/table and insert sample data (e.g., CREATE DATABASE test; CREATE TABLE test.t1(...); INSERT INTO test.t1 ...;)\n- Query a specific table (you must name schema.table)\n\nWhen you choose, I will (1) explain what the SQL will do, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). After you run it and supply the raw MySQL output, I will interpret the result and continue.",
