The container has MariaDB installed and running (started with mysqld_safe) and the mysql client can connect as root without a password from localhost. Current databases are only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and there are no non-system/application tables present. I have not executed any application-specific SQL because you haven't specified what you want to do.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly one SQL action to perform next. Pick one precise request (or provide another):\n- Inspect server/version info (e.g., SELECT @@version;)\n- List accounts (e.g., SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;)\n- Show grants for root (e.g., SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';)\n- List any non-system tables (e.g., SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');)\n- Create a database/table and insert sample rows (specify names and columns)\n\nWhen you choose, I will (1) explain what I will retrieve or change, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will run that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will then interpret it and continue.",
