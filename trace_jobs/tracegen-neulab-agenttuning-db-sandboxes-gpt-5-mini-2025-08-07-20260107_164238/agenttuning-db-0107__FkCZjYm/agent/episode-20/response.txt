  "analysis": "The last executed SQL (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\") produced no visible output in the terminal. MariaDB is running and other mysql -e queries previously returned results, so the empty output suggests either the SHOW GRANTS target produced zero rows (unlikely) or the client/server returned output in a form that wasn't displayed. To determine root's effective privileges we should try variants: SHOW GRANTS for the current user, the generic SHOW GRANTS (which shows grants for the connected account), and finally inspect mysql.user rows for the root account to see privilege columns. This will allow us to understand what root can do and why SHOW GRANTS might have appeared empty.",
  "plan": "Run three diagnostic mysql client commands in order:\n1) SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER(); — shows grants for the account used by the current connection (safer than specifying user@host). Expect one or more GRANT statements describing privileges.\n2) SHOW GRANTS; — shows grants for the current connected user (same intent, different syntax); expect similar output.\n3) SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost'\\G — inspect the mysql.user row for root to view privilege columns (Grant_priv, Super_priv, etc.) and plugin/auth settings. This helps confirm root's privileges even if SHOW GRANTS behaves oddly.\nI'll run each as a separate shell command. After you provide the outputs, I'll interpret them and propose the next action.",
