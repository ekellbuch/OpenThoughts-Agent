  "analysis": "Currently I'm at a root shell in /app inside the container. There are no files in /app beyond . and ..; /var/lib/mysql does not exist; there is no mysqld process running; and the mysql client is not installed (bash: mysql: command not found). Nothing so far has created or exposed a MySQL server or client in this environment. To be able to run SQL against a MySQL-compatible server I need to install a server and client (or start an existing server). That has not yet been done.",
  "plan": "1) Detect whether apt-get is available. 2) If apt is available, install a MariaDB/MySQL server and client packages non-interactively. 3) Ensure the MySQL runtime directories exist and start the server process directly (systemd likely not present in this container). 4) After the server is started, run a simple SQL command to confirm connectivity (SHOW DATABASES;). Each command below is chosen to reveal status or perform the required installation/startup and then test the SQL connection.",
