  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container where MariaDB 10.11.13 is installed and running (started via mysqld_safe). The mysql client is present and root@localhost can connect without a password. Current databases are only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no non-system/application databases or tables. I have not executed any application-specific SQL because you have not specified the single SQL statement to run next (per your rule: one SQL statement per round).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly one SQL action to perform next. When you specify it I will: (1) briefly explain what the SQL will do and why, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rule (the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a one-line SQL code block). Pick one precise action (or provide an exact SQL statement). Example choices you can copy or adapt:\n- Inspect server version: SELECT @@version;\n- List accounts: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for root: SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- List non-system tables: SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Create a database: CREATE DATABASE test_db;\n- Create a table: CREATE TABLE test_db.t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));\n- Insert a row: INSERT INTO test_db.t1 (id,name) VALUES (1,'alice');\n- Create a user: CREATE USER 'alice'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n- Change root password: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPass';\n\nTell me exactly one of the above (or another exact single SQL statement). I will then output the required Action: Operation block containing that single-line SQL statement for you to execute.",
