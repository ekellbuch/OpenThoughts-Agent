  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt in a container (/app). No prior commands have been run in this session. There is no visible MySQL output yet and I don't know whether MySQL is installed/running or what credentials are available. To proceed I need to detect if the mysql client and server files are present and then try a non-interactive query (SHOW DATABASES) as root (no password) to see if I can connect. If the server requires a password, the query will fail and I'll adjust next steps based on the error output you provide.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see project files. 2) Check the MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) for evidence of databases. 3) Check running processes to see if a mysqld server is running. 4) Check the mysql client version. 5) Attempt a non-interactive connection as root and run SHOW DATABASES; to discover available databases. Based on the result, we'll either proceed to query specific tables or handle authentication errors.",
