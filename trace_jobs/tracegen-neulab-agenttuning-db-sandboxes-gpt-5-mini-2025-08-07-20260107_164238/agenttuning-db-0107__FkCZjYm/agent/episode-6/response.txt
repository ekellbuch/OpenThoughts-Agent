When you specify, I will: 1) briefly explain what the SQL will do and why, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the literal line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL code block). Possible choices you can pick from include (but are not limited to):\n- Inspect server info: SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'; or SELECT @@version;\n- Inspect users/privileges: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; or SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Create a database/table and insert sample rows: CREATE DATABASE test; CREATE TABLE test.t1(...); INSERT INTO test.t1 ...;\n- Query existing data if you tell me schema/table names.\nTell me which of these (or a different precise SQL action) you want me to run. I will then output the single SQL statement as required. I will not run any SQL until you choose the action.",
