  "analysis": "MariaDB 10.11.13 was installed and started. The mysql client connects as root@localhost without a password in this container. SHOW DATABASES returned only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The mysql.user table lists mariadb.sys, mysql, and root (all@localhost). SHOW GRANTS for root@localhost shows: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO `root`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING 'invalid' OR unix_socket WITH GRANT OPTION, plus a PROXY grant. The mysql.user row for root confirms essentially all privilege flags are Y, plugin is mysql_native_password, and authentication_string is 'invalid' (root nonetheless connects locally). No non-system/application databases or tables exist yet.",

To help you choose, here are precise options you can request; when you pick one I will: (1) explain what it will do, and (2) emit exactly one SQL statement in the required format.\n\nOptions (pick one exact action or provide your own single SQL statement):\n- Show server version (we already ran this): SELECT @@version;\n- List users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Show grants for current connection: SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER();\n- Show grants for root (we ran this): SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost';\n- Inspect root's privilege columns: SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host='localhost'\\G\n- List any non-system tables: SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Create a new database: CREATE DATABASE your_db_name; (specify name)\n- Create a table and insert rows: e.g. CREATE TABLE your_db_name.t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100)); or a combined CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ... depending on need\n- Create a new MySQL user and grant privileges: CREATE USER 'alice'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_db_name.* TO 'alice'@'%'; (Note: each is an individual SQL statement; you must pick one per round)\n- Set/alter root password: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPass';\n\nTell me which single SQL statement to run (copy one of the above or provide your own exact SQL). I will then output that one statement in the required format for you to execute.",
