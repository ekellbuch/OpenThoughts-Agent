The server currently only has system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) and no user/application databases. To continue diagnosing or answering questions about the server, a reasonable next piece of information is the server version string so we know exactly which MariaDB/MySQL release we're working with.",

This will return the version string (e.g., 10.11.x or 8.0.x) and help determine SQL features and behavior. After you provide the MySQL output, I'll interpret it and propose the next single SQL action (for example listing users or creating a test database).",
