  "analysis": "You are in a container shell as root. No commands have been run yet in this session (the terminal shows the initial prompt). The task is to operate a MySQL database via SQL statements, but I don't yet know where MySQL is installed or whether a server is running or what credentials to use. Before issuing SQL, I need to discover the MySQL client and server status and locate database files/config so I can connect. Nothing has been accomplished so far; we need to detect the MySQL client binary, check for a running mysqld process, and inspect common MySQL directories and environment variables to determine connection details.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the MySQL client binary is available (mysql --version). 2) Look for a running mysqld process to see if a server is running. 3) List MySQL data and configuration directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql) to find databases or config that might indicate credentials or socket paths. 4) Grep environment variables for mysql-related entries (in case connection info is provided via env). After these discoveries, I'll propose the exact mysql client invocation to run a single SQL statement as required.",
