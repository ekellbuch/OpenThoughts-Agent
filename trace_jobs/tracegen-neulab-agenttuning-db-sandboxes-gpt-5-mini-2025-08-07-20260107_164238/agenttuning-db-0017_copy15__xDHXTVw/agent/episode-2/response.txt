  "analysis": "Current environment has no MySQL client or server: 'mysql' command is not found, no 'mysqld' process, and no MySQL directories or files were found. The /app directory is empty. Therefore we cannot run SQL against a MySQL server from this container yet. To proceed with issuing SQL statements we need a client available (to connect to a remote server or a local one if the user provides/starts it). Nothing has been accomplished toward installing a client or connecting to a database.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL-compatible client so we can run SQL statements from this container. I'll: 1) update apt package lists; 2) install the default MySQL client package (this provides the 'mysql' CLI) in a non-interactive way; 3) verify the mysql client is available. After that, I'll ask you to provide the database host, port, user, and password (or socket) and the SQL question you want executed. If you already have a server running elsewhere, we'll connect to it using the installed client and then I will provide the single-line SQL statement in the required markdown format for you to execute and return results.",
