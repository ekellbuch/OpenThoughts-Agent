  "analysis": "So far: the container has no mysql client binary (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, and no standard MySQL directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql) present. There are no mysql-related environment variables. Nothing has been done to connect to a database yet. To proceed I need to discover if any database files (MySQL socket, SQL dumps, SQLite files, or other DB files) exist in the filesystem or if there are application files/configs that contain DB connection info. If a DB file (e.g., .sql dump or a sqlite DB) is found, I can operate on it or ask you to run SQL against a MySQL server if one becomes available. Right now, no DB server/client has been found, so the next step is filesystem discovery for DB artifacts or config.",
  "plan": "1) List the /app directory to see project files that might include DB files or configs. 2) Search the filesystem for a MySQL socket (mysql.sock) which would indicate a running server or socket file. 3) Search for SQL dump files (*.sql) that could be inspected/loaded. 4) Search for local DB files (SQLite: *.sqlite, *.sqlite3, *.db) which we could query locally using sqlite3 if available (or inspect). 5) Search /app for files containing the string 'mysql' which might reveal credentials or connection details. Based on results, I'll recommend the next exact SQL command to run (remember: you will execute the first SQL code block I provide).",
