  "analysis": "You are in a shell (root@cefe1be18570:/app#). No MySQL client has been invoked and no SQL has been executed. Nothing has been accomplished yet toward answering a database question because you haven't provided the question or any database connection details (host, port, user, password, database name). To proceed I need the specific question you want answered and credentials or instructions for connecting to the MySQL server (for example: use socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, or host, port, user, password, database). Once I have the question and connection details I can plan precise SQL to run. I will only send one SQL statement per operation round (in a single-line SQL code block) as you requested, and you will run it and return the MySQL output for me to interpret and continue.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and connection details. Please tell me: (1) the exact question you want answered about the database (for example: list customers in region X, count orders in a date range, find rows with NULL in column Y, etc.), and (2) how I should connect to MySQL (host, port, user, password, database) or whether I should use the local unix socket as root. After you provide those, I will: 1) connect (if needed) or ask you to run a single SQL statement that I craft, 2) analyze the result you return, 3) possibly run further single SQL statements iteratively until we can produce the final answer. Example commands I will run once I have details: - mysql -u root -p -e \"USE db; SHOW TABLES;\" (to discover schema) - then targeted SELECT statements to answer your question. Each SQL I ask you to execute will be provided as a single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block as you requested. For now I will wait for your question and connection details.",
