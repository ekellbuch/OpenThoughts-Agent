Nothing has been changed in the environment since the last message.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific question you want answered about the MySQL database and connection details (host, port, user, password, database name, or whether I should use the local Unix socket). If you want me to try discovering an existing local MySQL instance automatically, I can run a small set of read-only inspection commands to find the client, socket, running mysqld process, or any local MySQL credentials (e.g. /etc/mysql/debian.cnf). Please tell me whether you want me to: (A) attempt automatic discovery (I will run the inspection commands below), or (B) you will supply explicit connection details. If you choose (A), I will run one command at a time (per your rule about a single SQL per round—here these are shell commands) and report the outputs; after discovering connection details I will craft the first SQL statement (in a single-line SQL code block) to run against the database to begin answering your question.",
