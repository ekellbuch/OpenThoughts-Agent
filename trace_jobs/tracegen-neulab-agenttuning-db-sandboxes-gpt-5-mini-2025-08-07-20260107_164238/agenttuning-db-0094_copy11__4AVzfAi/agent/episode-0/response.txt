  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container (prompt: root@67869b14352a:/app#). No MySQL commands have been run yet and no question from the user has been given. To help with subsequent SQL operations I need to know whether a MySQL client is available, whether a MySQL server is running, where the MySQL socket/data directories are, and whether any MYSQL-related environment variables (credentials, host, port) are set. I will probe the environment and services to gather that information so when you provide the question I can form the correct SQL and connection command.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a MySQL client binary (mysql --version). 2) Check for a running MySQL server process (ps aux grep mysqld). 3) List common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) to find sockets/config. 4) Print MYSQL-related environment variables to find credentials or host/port. 5) Check listening TCP ports for a mysql process (ss -ltnp | grep mysql) to detect network-accessible server. 6) Leave a prompt (echo) telling you I'm ready for the specific MySQL question. Each command is short and non-blocking so we can iterate quickly after seeing the outputs.",
