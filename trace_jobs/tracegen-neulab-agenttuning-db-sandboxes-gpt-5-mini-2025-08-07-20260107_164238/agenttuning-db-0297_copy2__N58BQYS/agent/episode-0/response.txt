  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. No MySQL activity has been performed yet in this session. There is no information about the database location, credentials, or schema. Before I can run SQL against the database I need to locate a MySQL client, check whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running (and on which host/port), and look for any configuration files or environment variables that might contain credentials. Once I find the client/server and (if present) credentials or socket/host info, I can connect and run SQL statements when you ask a specific question.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see if there are project files or DB config. 2) Check running processes for mysql/mariadb to see if a server is running in this container. 3) Check listening TCP sockets for port 3306. 4) Locate a mysql client binary and check its version. 5) Inspect environment variables for common DB credentials (MYSQL_*, DB_*, etc.). 6) Search for common MySQL config files (.my.cnf, my.cnf) under the root filesystem top-level directories to find possible credentials or socket paths. After these checks, I'll report findings and ask you for the specific question to run SQL for, or if I find credentials/sockets I can attempt a connection.",
