  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. I ran checks for MySQL/MariaDB binaries, running processes, listening sockets, environment variables, and common config files. None of the checks located a mysql client binary, a running mysqld process, environment credentials, or my.cnf files (only /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf was found). This means there is currently no local MySQL server or client evident in the container, and no obvious credentials or config to connect to a remote server have been exposed via environment variables or common config files. To proceed I need to search the filesystem for sockets, directories, or other clues (e.g., /var/lib/mysql, /var/run/mysqld, /etc/mysql) that might indicate a local server, or find a client binary to run queries. If none are found, the container likely doesn't have MySQL installed and we will need connection details (host, port, user, password) for a remote server, or permission to install a client here.",
  "plan": "1) Check for alternative client binaries (mariadb, mysqladmin) with command -v so we know if any client is available. 2) Inspect common directories for MySQL server files and sockets: /var/lib, /var/run, /var/run/mysqld, /etc/mysql. 3) Search /var/run and /tmp for socket files which might be the MySQL socket. 4) Search for any directories named with 'mysql' in the top-level filesystem to find possible installations. Based on results I will report findings and request the specific SQL question or credentials to connect. I will run only lightweight commands to enumerate these artifacts.",
