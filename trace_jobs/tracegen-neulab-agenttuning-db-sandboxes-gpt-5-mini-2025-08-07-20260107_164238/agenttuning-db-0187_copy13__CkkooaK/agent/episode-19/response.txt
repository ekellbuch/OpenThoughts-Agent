  "analysis": "The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a local MySQL server are installed and running on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A prior check showed only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept a single non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact question you want answered using SQL. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (in the single-line SQL code block format you required) labeled as an Operation for you to execute. If you prefer I can run an exploratory query first — pick one of these and I will supply the single SQL statement to execute:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nReply with the exact question or choose one of the exploratory options (include names/conditions if needed). I will then produce the single SQL operation statement for you to run.",
