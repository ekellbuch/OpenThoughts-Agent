  "analysis": "A MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a local MySQL server are installed and running on the host. The server was initialized insecurely so the root user can connect with no password. A prior check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept one non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact question you want answered with SQL, or to choose an exploratory query. When you give the question (or pick an exploratory action), I will: 1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and 2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted as you required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze the results and either produce another operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
