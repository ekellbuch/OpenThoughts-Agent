  "analysis": "The environment has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a running local MySQL server (started with an insecure initialization so root can connect with no password). A previous check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The server is ready to accept single non-interactive SQL statements via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question you want answered with SQL or pick one exploratory action so I can provide the single SQL statement you must run. Options (pick one or give your own, include database/table names and any WHERE condition if relevant):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply with the chosen action (and any required names/conditions), I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line code-block format (Action: Operation plus a one-line SQL block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze the output and continue until we can produce the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
