  "analysis": "A MySQL client and server are installed and running on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A previous non-interactive check returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet because you haven't provided a question or requested any SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the exact question you want answered or permit an exploratory query. Please tell me one of the following (or provide your own):\n- List databases: I will run SHOW DATABASES; to see which databases exist.\n- List tables in a database: tell me the database name and I will run SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;\n- Show a table schema: tell me database and table names and I will run SHOW CREATE TABLE <database>.<table>;\n- Count rows in a table: tell me database and table names and I will run SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;\n- Query rows with a condition: tell me database, table, and condition and I will run SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition>;\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the approach and what data I need, and (2) give exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze and continue until we can produce the final answer with the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
