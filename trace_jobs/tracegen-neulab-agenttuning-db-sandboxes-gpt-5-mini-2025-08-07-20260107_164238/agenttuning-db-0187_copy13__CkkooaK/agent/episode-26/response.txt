  "analysis": "The system has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a running local MySQL server. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password. A previous non-interactive check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept one non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact question you want answered with SQL. When you provide the question (or pick one exploratory action), I will: 1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and 2) give exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). Suggested exploratory actions you can choose now (or give your own precise request including database/table names and any WHERE condition):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nI will not run any SQL until you tell me which action to take. After you execute the single SQL statement I supply and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and continue with further operations or provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
