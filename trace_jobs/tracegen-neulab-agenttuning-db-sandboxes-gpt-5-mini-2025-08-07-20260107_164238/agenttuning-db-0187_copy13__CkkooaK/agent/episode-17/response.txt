  "analysis": "The system has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a running local MySQL server (started with an insecure initialization so root can connect with no password). A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept non-interactive SQL statements via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me the exact question to answer or pick an exploratory query. Please choose one of these options (or give your own precise request including database/table names and any WHERE conditions):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply with the chosen action (and the needed names/conditions), I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the format you specified (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either request another operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
