A quick check earlier returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected yet. I am waiting for the specific question or the name of a database/table you want to query.",
  "plan": "Tell me the exact question you want answered with SQL (examples: list tables in a database, count rows in a table, select rows matching a condition, aggregate data, join tables, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze it and either provide another operation or, if finished, give the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern. If you prefer I can begin exploratory queries (for example: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;), tell me which exploration query to run. No commands will be run until you specify the question or give permission for an exploratory statement.",
