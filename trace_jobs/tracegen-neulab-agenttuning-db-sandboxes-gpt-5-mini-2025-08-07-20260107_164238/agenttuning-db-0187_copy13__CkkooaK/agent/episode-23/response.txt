  "analysis": "The system has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a running local MySQL server (initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password). A prior check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not given a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The server is ready to accept one non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact question you want answered with SQL, or pick one exploratory action so I can supply the single SQL statement you'll execute. When you reply I will (1) explain my understanding of the requested result and the SQL approach and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block as you required). Choose one of these options or provide your own (include database/table names and any WHERE condition if applicable):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nI will not execute any SQL until you tell me which action to take. If you want me to start exploratory inspection, tell me which of the above to run and I will return exactly one SQL statement for you to execute.",
