  "analysis": "You now have a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server. The mysql client (8.0.44) was installed earlier. The MySQL server package was installed and the data directory initialized with an insecure root account (no password). mysqld was started (PID 1429) and a non-interactive check returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. In short: the environment is ready for executing SQL statements as root with no password via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to ask the specific question you want answered using SQL. When you ask, I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and the required data to answer it. 2) Provide one SQL statement (in the exact format you requested) to run against the database. Reminder of the rules you specified: I must provide SQL in a single code block and only one SQL statement per round; you will execute the first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. After you return the output, I'll analyze it and either run another SQL operation or, if done, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you prefer, I can proactively run an exploratory query now (for example: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;) — tell me which database/table or question to operate on.",
