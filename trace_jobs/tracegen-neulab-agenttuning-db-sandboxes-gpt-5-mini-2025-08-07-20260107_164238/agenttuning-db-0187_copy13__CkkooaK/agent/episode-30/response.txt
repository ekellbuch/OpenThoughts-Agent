  "analysis": "The MySQL server was previously started manually but its background process was killed (likely by the system OOM or another signal). The error log shows multiple start/shutdown cycles and a final startup message showing mysqld was ready for connections at 21:48:17, but when I tried to run SHOW DATABASES the server was not reachable and the nohup job was reported as killed. System memory is nearly exhausted (free -m shows ~63 MB free and swap fully used), which strongly suggests the server was terminated due to low memory. We couldn't read dmesg (permission), so the kernel OOM logs aren't directly available. To proceed we should (A) check whether a mysqld process is running now, (B) inspect the recent MySQL error log for any shutdown/kill messages, (C) try to start mysqld again and then immediately run SHOW DATABASES to confirm connectivity. If the server is killed again, we'll need to either free memory or use a lighter-weight database (or increase available resources).",
  "plan": "1) Confirm whether any mysqld process is currently running. 2) Show the tail of the MySQL error log to see recent shutdown reason. 3) Check current memory usage to confirm low-memory situation. 4) Attempt to start mysqld manually (nohup ...) and give it a few seconds to initialize. 5) Check the process list and then run a single non-interactive SQL statement to list databases (mysql -u root -e 'SHOW DATABASES;'). 6) If that fails, inspect the server log tail for new messages. The commands below implement those steps. I will wait for the outputs to determine next steps (free memory, restart differently, or adjust configuration).",
