There's no MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) and no mysqld process running, so no local server is present. Nothing has been done yet to provide a MySQL client or server. To run SQL statements I need a mysql client available (or connection details for a remote server).",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client so I can run non-interactive SQL commands. I'll use the distribution's default MySQL client package. 2) Verify the client is installed by checking mysql --version. After that, if you want me to operate on a local server I can install and start a server, but first I'll stop after installing the client and ask for the database host/credentials or whether to install a local server. Commands: apt-get update, then install default-mysql-client non-interactively, then show mysql --version.",
