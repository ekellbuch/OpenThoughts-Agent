No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a question or requested any SQL to run.

Please tell me which of the following (or provide your own precise request, including database/table names and any WHERE condition):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply with the chosen action (and required names/conditions), I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. I will wait for your instruction.",
