  "analysis": "The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a local MySQL server are installed and running on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so the root user can connect with no password. A prior non-interactive check showed only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept SQL non-interactively via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the exact question you want answered. Please tell me which of the following (or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database (specify DB): SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema (specify DB and table): SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table (specify DB and table): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition (specify DB, table, condition): SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply with which action and any required names/conditions, I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you execute it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze that output and either provide another operation or finish with the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
