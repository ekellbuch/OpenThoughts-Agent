  "analysis": "You have a working local MySQL server and mysql client on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A previous check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept a single non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give the exact question you want answered or permit an exploratory query. Please reply with one precise request (include database and table names and any WHERE condition if relevant). Example options you can pick or adapt:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you provide the question or choose one exploratory action, I will: (1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (formatted per your rules) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze the result and continue or provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
