  "analysis": "The previous attempt to run SHOW DATABASES failed because the mysqld server process was killed (the shell shows the background job was killed). We don't yet know why — common causes are the OOM killer, configuration/startup error, or missing files/permissions. The server had been started manually with nohup earlier and was running (PID 1429) but was then killed before this SHOW DATABASES attempt. To proceed safely we need to inspect mysqld logs and system state (process list, memory) to determine why it was killed, then either restart the server or address the underlying issue. I will not immediately try to restart mysqld until I examine the logs to avoid repeated kills and to gather the error cause.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether any mysqld processes are currently running. 2) Inspect the MySQL server log(s) (/var/log/mysqld.log and /var/log/mysql/error.log) to find error messages explaining why the server was killed. 3) Check system memory and kernel logs (free -m and dmesg) for OOM killer messages. 4) Based on findings, either attempt to restart mysqld (if safe) or report findings and request permission to restart/adjust configuration. Commands will be non-interactive and read-only at first to gather diagnostics.",
