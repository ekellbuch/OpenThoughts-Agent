  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a running local MySQL server (initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password). A prior check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept one non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the exact question you want answered or choose one exploratory query. Please reply with a precise request (include database and table names and any WHERE condition if relevant). Example options you can pick or adapt: \n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you choose, I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement labeled as Action: Operation with the SQL in a single-line code block (per your rules) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either provide another operation or finish with the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
