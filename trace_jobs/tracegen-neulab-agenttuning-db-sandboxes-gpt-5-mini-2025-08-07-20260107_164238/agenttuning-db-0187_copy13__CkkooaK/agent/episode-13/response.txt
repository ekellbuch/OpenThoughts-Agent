A previous check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run.

Possible choices (pick one or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply with which action (and any database/table/condition names required), I will: (1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. I will not run any SQL until you specify which action to take.",
