A prior check returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided the specific question or requested any SQL to run.",

When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (in the single-line markdown SQL code block format you required) as an operation for you to execute. If you want me to first explore the server, tell me which exploratory query to run (for example: SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;). I will not run any commands until you specify which action to take.",
