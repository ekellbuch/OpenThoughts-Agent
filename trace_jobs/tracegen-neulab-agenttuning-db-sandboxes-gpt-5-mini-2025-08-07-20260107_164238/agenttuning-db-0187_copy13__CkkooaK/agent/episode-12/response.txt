A prior check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been examined because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run.

When you provide the question or choose an exploratory action I will: (1) explain what data I need and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). Options you can pick now:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database (specify DB): SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show table schema (specify DB and table): SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table (specify DB and table): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition (specify DB, table, condition): SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nReply with which action you want (or give your own question), and I will respond with the single SQL operation statement to run.",
