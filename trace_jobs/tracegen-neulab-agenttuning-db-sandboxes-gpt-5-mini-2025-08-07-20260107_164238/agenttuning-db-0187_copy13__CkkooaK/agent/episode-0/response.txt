  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. No commands have been run yet in this session. There's no information about whether MySQL client is installed or whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running. To proceed with any SQL operations I need to detect the mysql client, check for a running server (mysqld) and then attempt a non-interactive connection to list databases/tables. Depending on those results I will decide further SQL to execute.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary is available (which mysql and mysql --version). 2) Check whether a mysqld server process and socket directory exist (/var/run/mysqld and ps aux | grep mysqld). 3) Attempt a non-interactive connection as root to run a simple statement (SHOW DATABASES;) so I can see what databases exist. Based on the output I will plan the next SQL statement to answer your eventual question or to inspect a specific database/table. Each command is non-interactive and returns immediate output. The mysql command will be run in a non-interactive way; if it requires a password or the server is unreachable it will show an error which I will use to adjust the next steps.",
