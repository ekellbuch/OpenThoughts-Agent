  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (mysql --version shows MySQL 8.0 client). Earlier there was no MySQL server running and no /var/run/mysqld socket. At this point we have a client but still no evidence of a local server to connect to. To run SQL I need either (A) connection details for a remote server (host, port, user, password or socket) or (B) permission to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here. I should not assume credentials. The next step is to check for any server processes, socket files, or environment variables that might provide connection info; then attempt a local connection to demonstrate the expected outcome (likely an error if no server). After that I will wait for your question (the SQL task) or for connection credentials/permission to install a server.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect /etc/mysql to see if any configuration or socket path exists. 2) List /var/run/mysqld to check for sockets. 3) Check for any running mysqld processes. 4) Look for MySQL-related environment variables that might point to a remote host or credentials. 5) Attempt a non-interactive connection to localhost to show the result (if server absent this will fail and show the error). Based on the output you can either provide DB credentials/host or ask me to install and configure a local server. Commands are non-interactive and quick.",
