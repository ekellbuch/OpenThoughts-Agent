  "analysis": "The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a local MySQL server are installed and running on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so the root account can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A previous check showed only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept a single non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact question you want answered with SQL. When you give the question (or choose an exploratory action) I will: (1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). Options you can pick now (or provide your own):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nDo not run any SQL yet — reply with which action or the specific question (including database/table names and any conditions). I will then produce the single SQL statement for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the results and either request another operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
