  "analysis": "A local MySQL server is installed and running (mysqld PID shown earlier). The mysql client is available (mysql 8.0.44). The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password. A quick verification SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any more commands until you give the question you want answered with SQL. Tell me the specific question (for example: list tables in a database, count rows in a table, find rows matching a condition, join two tables, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement formatted as you required (in a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze that output and either produce another operation or finish with the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern. If you prefer I can first explore the server (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; or SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;). If so, specify which exploration query you want.",
