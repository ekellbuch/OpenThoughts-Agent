A previous check showed the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you haven't provided a question or requested any SQL yet. The server is ready to accept queries via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",

If you prefer, choose one of these exploratory actions and I will provide the single SQL statement (in the required single-line SQL code block format) for you to execute once you confirm:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you pick one, I'll (1) explain the approach and (2) give exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run. I will not run any SQL until you instruct me which action to take.",
