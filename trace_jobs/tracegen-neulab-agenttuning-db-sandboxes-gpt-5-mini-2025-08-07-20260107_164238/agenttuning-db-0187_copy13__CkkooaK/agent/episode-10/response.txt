A previous check returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept SQL operations issued as: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific question you want answered using SQL. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the data needed and the SQL approach, and (2) give exactly one SQL statement (formatted per your rules) to run. If you prefer I can first run an exploratory query to discover structure; choose one of these or provide your own and I will produce the single SQL statement for you to execute:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database (specify DB): SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show table schema (specify DB and table): SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table (specify DB and table): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition (specify DB, table, condition): SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nDo you want to (A) ask a specific question, or (B) run one of the exploratory queries above? Reply which one and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
