  "analysis": "You have a working local MySQL server and mysql client on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A prior check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept one non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you give the exact question to answer. Please provide one precise request that includes any database and table names and any WHERE condition if relevant. Examples you can choose or adapt:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply with the chosen action (or your own precise question), I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules as an Operation. Reminder of your rule: every SQL I provide must be in a single SQL code block and only the first SQL code block will be executed by you. After you execute it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either produce another operation or finish with the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
