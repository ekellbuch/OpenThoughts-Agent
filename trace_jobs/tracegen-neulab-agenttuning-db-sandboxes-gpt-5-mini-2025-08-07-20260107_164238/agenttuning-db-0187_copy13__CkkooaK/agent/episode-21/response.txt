  "analysis": "MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a local MySQL server are installed and running on this host. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A prior check showed only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept a single non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the exact question you want answered or choose an exploratory action. Please reply with one precise request (include database/table names and any WHERE condition if relevant). Example choices you can pick or adapt:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nOnce you specify the question/choice I will (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze the output and continue or finish with the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern.",
