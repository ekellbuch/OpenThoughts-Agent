  "analysis": "The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) and a local MySQL server are installed and running. The server was initialized insecurely so root can connect with no password (mysql -u root works). A prior check returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you haven't given a question or requested any SQL to run. The environment is ready to accept one non-interactive SQL statement at a time via: mysql -u root -e '<SQL>'.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me the exact question you want answered. Please pick one of the following or provide your own precise question (include database/table names and any conditions):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show schema for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\nWhen you reply I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and the SQL approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either produce another operation or, when finished, return the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
