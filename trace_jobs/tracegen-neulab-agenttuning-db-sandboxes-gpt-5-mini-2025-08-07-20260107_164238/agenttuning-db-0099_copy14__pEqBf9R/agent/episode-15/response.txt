  "analysis": "The container now has a running MySQL server and client. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or target database/table names. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further SQL operations should be executed until you specify what you want queried or changed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (for example: \"SHOW TABLES IN database_name\", \"DESCRIBE table_name IN database_name\", \"SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition\", \"COUNT(*) FROM table\", etc.). Provide the target database and table names if you know them. After you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL I intend to run, and 2) either (A) perform a single SQL operation by outputting: Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output), or (B) provide the final answer by outputting: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"...\"] if no DB operation is needed. I will only produce one SQL statement per round as requested.",
