A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to run SQL.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered. Provide the target database and table names if you know them. Examples you can choose or adapt:\n- \"Show tables in database mydb\"  (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;)\n- \"Describe table users in database mydb\"  (I would run: DESCRIBE mydb.users;)\n- \"Select rows from orders where status = 'open'\"  (I would run: SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE status = 'open' LIMIT 100;)\n- \"Count rows in table events\"  (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events;)\nWhen you provide the precise question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either perform one operation by outputting Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (which you will execute and return the output), or provide the final answer (Action: Answer) if no SQL is needed. I will run at most one SQL statement per round as you requested.",
