A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application/user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target database/table names yet. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further SQL operations have been performed since the server started.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Once you give the precise question (and, if known, the target database and table names), I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either (A) perform one SQL operation by outputting: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output), or (B) provide the final answer by outputting: Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]. I will run at most one SQL statement per round as you requested. Examples you can ask for: - \"Show tables in database mydb\" -> SHOW TABLES FROM mydb; - \"Describe table users in database mydb\" -> DESCRIBE mydb.users; - \"Select rows from orders where status = 'open'\" -> SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE status = 'open' LIMIT 100; - \"Count rows in table events\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events; Please state the exact question now.",
