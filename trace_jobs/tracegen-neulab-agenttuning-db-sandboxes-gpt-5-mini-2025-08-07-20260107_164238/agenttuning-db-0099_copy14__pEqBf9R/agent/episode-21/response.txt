  "plan": "I will wait for you to give the exact database question you want answered. Please tell me precisely what to query and, if known, the target database and table name(s). Examples of acceptable requests and the single SQL statement I would run for each (one statement per round):\n- To list tables in a database named mydb: SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;\n- To show a table schema for mydb.users: DESCRIBE mydb.users;\n- To get up to 100 rows from mydb.orders: SELECT * FROM mydb.orders LIMIT 100;\n- To count rows in mydb.events: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events;\n- To find rows matching a condition: SELECT * FROM mydb.products WHERE category = 'X' LIMIT 100;\nWhen you provide the precise question I will (1) explain my understanding and the SQL I intend to run, and (2) either (A) perform one SQL operation by outputting Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output), or (B) provide the final answer with Action: Answer if no DB operation is needed. I will run at most one SQL statement per round as requested.",
