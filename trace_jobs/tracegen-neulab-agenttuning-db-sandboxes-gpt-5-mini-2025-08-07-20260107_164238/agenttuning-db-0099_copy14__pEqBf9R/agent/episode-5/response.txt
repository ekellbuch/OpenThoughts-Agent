Once you provide the question, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL I plan to run, 2) choose to either perform an operation (issue a single SQL statement) or provide the final answer if no DB operation is needed, and 3) if operating, output Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown code block) which you will execute and return the result for me to parse and continue. For now I will not run any further commands until you state the question or the next desired operation.",
