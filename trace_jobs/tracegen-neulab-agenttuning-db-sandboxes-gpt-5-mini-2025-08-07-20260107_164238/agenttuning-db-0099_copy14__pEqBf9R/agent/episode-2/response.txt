  "analysis": "The mysql client is now installed (/usr/bin/mysql Ver 8.0.44), but attempting to connect to the local server with mysql -uroot failed: ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2). That indicates no MySQL server is listening on the local Unix socket. I have not yet tried TCP connections or inspected whether a server process exists elsewhere. To proceed I need to determine whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running in the container (or on a TCP port), whether a socket file exists, or whether I should install/start a server or connect to a remote host. Nothing has been changed to the database itself yet.",
  "plan": "1) Check for running MySQL/MariaDB processes to see if a server is running. 2) Check listening TCP ports (esp. 3306) to detect a server listening on TCP. 3) Inspect /var/run/mysqld for socket files and check MySQL client config (/etc/mysql/my.cnf) to see configured socket/port. 4) Check environment variables for database connection info (common names like MYSQL_HOST, DB_HOST, etc.). Based on results, either attempt a TCP connection (mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") or, if no server exists, ask whether you want me to install and start a local mysql-server (or provide remote connection details). The commands below implement steps 1-4 to gather that info.",
