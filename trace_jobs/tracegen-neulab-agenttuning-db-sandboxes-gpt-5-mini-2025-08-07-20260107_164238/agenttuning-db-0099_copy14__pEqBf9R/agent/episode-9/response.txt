A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user/application databases or tables have been inspected yet. You have not provided a specific database question to answer, so no further SQL operations have been performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact question you want answered from the database (for example: show tables in a particular database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, compute aggregates, join tables, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL I plan to run, (2) choose to either perform an operation or provide the final answer, and (3) if performing an operation, output exactly the required Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a one-line markdown code block per your instructions. After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse it and continue. Please state the precise question and, if known, the target database and table names.",
