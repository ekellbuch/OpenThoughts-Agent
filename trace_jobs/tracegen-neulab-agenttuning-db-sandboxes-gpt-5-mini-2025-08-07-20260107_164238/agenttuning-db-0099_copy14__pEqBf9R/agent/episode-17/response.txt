  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. mysqld is running and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user/application databases or tables have been inspected beyond that. You have not yet provided a specific database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question you want answered from the database. Examples of acceptable requests (pick one or provide your own precise question):\n- \"Show tables in database <database_name>\"  (I would run SHOW TABLES FROM database_name;)\n- \"Describe table <table_name> in database <database_name>\"  (I would run DESCRIBE database_name.table_name;)\n- \"Select all rows from table <table_name>\"  (I would run SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name LIMIT 100;)\n- \"Count rows in table <table_name>\"  (I would run SELECT COUNT(*) FROM database_name.table_name;)\n- \"Find rows where <column> = '<value>' in <table_name>\"  (I would run SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name WHERE column = 'value';)\nWhen you provide the precise question and, if possible, the target database and table names, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either (A) output Action: Operation followed by exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output), or (B) if no DB operation is required, output Action: Answer with the final answer. I will issue at most one SQL statement per round as you requested.",
