  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running inside the container. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user/application databases or tables have been inspected yet. You have not provided a specific question to answer from the database, so no SQL operations have been performed beyond that initial discovery.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered (for example: show tables in a database, show schema of a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, compute aggregates, join tables, etc.). When you state the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I intend to run, 2) choose to either perform an operation or provide the final answer, and 3) if performing an operation, output: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output). Please tell me the precise question and, if known, the target database and table names.",
