  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and server. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql Ver 8.0.44) and mysqld is running with a socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question. Nothing else has been changed. I need a clear question (what data you want retrieved or modified) and, if available, the target database and table names. Once you give that, I'll explain my reasoning and either (A) perform one SQL operation (in the required format) or (B) provide the final answer if no DB operation is necessary.",
  "plan": "Please state the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can ask for: - \"Show databases\" - \"Show tables in database <name>\" - \"DESCRIBE table <name> in database <name>\" - \"SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <condition>\" - \"COUNT rows in <table>\" - any aggregate or join query. After you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I will run, 2) output either Action: Operation with one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or Action: Answer with the final answer if no DB operation is needed. I will issue at most one SQL statement per round as requested.",
