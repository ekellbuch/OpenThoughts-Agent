A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application/user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target database/table names. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further SQL operations have been performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered. Give the target database and table names if known. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own precise question):\n- \"Show tables in database mydb\"  (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;)\n- \"Describe table users in database mydb\"  (I would run: DESCRIBE mydb.users;)\n- \"Select rows from orders where status = 'open'\"  (I would run: SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE status = 'open' LIMIT 100;)\n- \"Count rows in table events\"  (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events;)\n\nWhen you provide the precise question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either output Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or output Action: Answer with the final answer if no DB operation is needed. I will issue at most one SQL statement per round as you requested.",
