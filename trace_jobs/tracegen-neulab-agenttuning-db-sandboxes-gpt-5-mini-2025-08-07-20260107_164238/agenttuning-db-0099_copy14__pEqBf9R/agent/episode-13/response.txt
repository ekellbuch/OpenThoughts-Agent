A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys).

After you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either output Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or output Action: Answer with the final answer if no DB operation is needed. I will issue at most one SQL statement per round as requested. Please state the precise question and, if known, the target database and table names.",
