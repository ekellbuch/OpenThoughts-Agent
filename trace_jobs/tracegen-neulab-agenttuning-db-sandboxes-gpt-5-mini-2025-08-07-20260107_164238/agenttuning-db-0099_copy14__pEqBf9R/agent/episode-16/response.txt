A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or user tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target database/table names. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further SQL has been executed since the server started.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered (examples: \"SHOW TABLES IN database_name\", \"DESCRIBE table_name IN database_name\", \"SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition\", \"COUNT(*) FROM table\", etc.). Once you provide the precise question and (if known) the target database/table names, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either perform an operation (outputting Action: Operation followed by one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer ...). I will only issue one SQL statement per round as requested. Please tell me the exact question to run against the database.",
