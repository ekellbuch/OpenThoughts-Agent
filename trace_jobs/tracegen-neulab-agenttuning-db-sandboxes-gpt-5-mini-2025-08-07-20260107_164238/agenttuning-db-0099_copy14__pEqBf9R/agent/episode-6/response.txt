Once you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL I will use, 2) choose to either operate (issue one SQL statement) or provide the final answer, and 3) if operating, output the single SQL statement in the required format so you can execute it and return the raw MySQL output for me to parse and continue. I will not run any further shell commands until you specify the database question or the next desired operation.",
