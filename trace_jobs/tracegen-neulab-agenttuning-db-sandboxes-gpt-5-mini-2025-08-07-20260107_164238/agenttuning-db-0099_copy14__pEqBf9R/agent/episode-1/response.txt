To run SQL against the database from this environment we first need a MySQL/MariaDB client available. After installing a client, we'll try to connect to the local server as root (no password) and run SHOW DATABASES; to discover available databases. If connecting fails we will adapt based on the error (e.g., provide socket/host or credentials).",

If that fails, we'll inspect the error and adjust (e.g., specify socket, host, or credentials).",
