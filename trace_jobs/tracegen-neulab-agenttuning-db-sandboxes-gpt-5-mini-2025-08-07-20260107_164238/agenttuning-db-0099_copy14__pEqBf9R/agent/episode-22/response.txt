  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application/user databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific question or target database/table names yet. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further SQL operations have been performed since the server started.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own precise question):\n- \"Show tables in database <database_name>\"  (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM <database_name>;) \n- \"Describe table <table_name> in database <database_name>\"  (I would run: DESCRIBE <database_name>.<table_name>;)\n- \"Select rows from <table_name> where <condition>\"  (I would run: SELECT * FROM <database_name>.<table_name> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;)\n- \"Count rows in table <table_name>\"  (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database_name>.<table_name>;) \nWhen you provide the precise question (and, if possible, the target database and table names), I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either output an operation (Action: Operation followed by exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or output Action: Answer with the final answer if no DB operation is needed. I will run at most one SQL statement per round as requested.",
