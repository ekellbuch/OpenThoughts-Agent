After you give the question (and, if known, the target database and table names), I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I intend to run, 2) choose to either (A) perform one SQL operation and output Action: Operation with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output), or (B) provide the final answer by outputting Action: Answer with Final Answer: [...].\n\nExamples of acceptable questions and the single SQL I would run for each:\n- \"Show tables in database mydb\"  -> SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;\n- \"Describe table users in database mydb\" -> DESCRIBE mydb.users;\n- \"Select rows from orders where status = 'open'\" -> SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE status = 'open' LIMIT 100;\n- \"Count rows in table events in database mydb\" -> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.events;\n- \"List databases\" -> SHOW DATABASES;\n\nPlease state the exact question now (and the database/table names if you know them). I will then explain the SQL I plan to run and either provide Action: Operation with one SQL statement or Action: Answer if no DB operation is needed.",
