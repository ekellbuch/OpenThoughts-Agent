A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or tables have been inspected because you haven't provided a specific question or target database/table names yet. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further operations have been performed.",

Examples: \"Show tables in database X\", \"Describe table users in database X\", \"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status='open'\", \"Count rows in table Y\", or any specific data retrieval/aggregation you need. After you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I intend to run, and (2) either output an operation (Action: Operation with one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block) for you to execute and return results, or output the final answer (Action: Answer) if no further SQL is needed. I will not run any shell commands until you give the database question.",
