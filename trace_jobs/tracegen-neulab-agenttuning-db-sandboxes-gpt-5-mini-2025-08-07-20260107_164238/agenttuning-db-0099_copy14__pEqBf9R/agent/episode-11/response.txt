Once you state the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and (2) either (a) perform an operation by outputting Action: Operation followed by one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or (b) if no DB operation is needed, output Action: Answer with the final answer. I will only issue one SQL statement at a time as you requested.",
