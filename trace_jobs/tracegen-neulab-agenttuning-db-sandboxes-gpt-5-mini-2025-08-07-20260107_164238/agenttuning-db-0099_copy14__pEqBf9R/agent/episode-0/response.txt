  "analysis": "You are in a container shell (root@8f3ab9198d73:/app#). No prior MySQL output is present. To operate the MySQL database I need to (1) confirm the mysql client is available, (2) determine its version, and (3) attempt a connection and run a simple SQL to discover available databases/tables. I haven't yet attempted any SQL, so nothing has been accomplished against the DB. Next I will check for the mysql client and then run a simple SHOW DATABASES; query to see what databases exist.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is installed (which mysql). 2) Print mysql client version (mysql --version). 3) Attempt to connect to the local MySQL server as root without a password and run SHOW DATABASES; so I can see available databases. If the server requires a password or socket options, we'll adapt after seeing the result. The SHOW DATABASES statement will be executed with the mysql client using -e and will return quickly.",
