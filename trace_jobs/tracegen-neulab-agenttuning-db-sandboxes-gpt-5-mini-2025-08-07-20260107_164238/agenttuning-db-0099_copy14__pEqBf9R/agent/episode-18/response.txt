  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The server (mysqld) is active and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user/application databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific question or target database/table names. The environment is ready to run SQL, and no further operations have been performed since the server started.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact database question you want answered. Examples you can ask for (pick one or provide your own precise question):\n- \"Show tables in database <database_name>\"  (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM database_name;)\n- \"Describe table <table_name> in database <database_name>\"  (I would run: DESCRIBE database_name.table_name;)\n- \"Select rows from <table_name> where <condition>\"  (I would run: SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name WHERE ... LIMIT 100;)\n- \"Count rows in table <table_name>\"  (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM database_name.table_name;)\nWhen you provide the precise question (and the database/table names if known), I will: 1) explain my understanding and the exact single SQL statement I will use, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (outputting Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block for you to execute) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer) if no DB operation is needed. I will run at most one SQL statement per round as requested.",
