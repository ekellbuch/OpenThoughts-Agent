Tell me exactly what you want to find from the database and, if known, the target database and table names. After you provide the question I'll: 1) explain the SQL I'll run and why, and 2) either issue a single SQL statement (Action: Operation with the SQL in a single-line code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or if no DB operation is needed I'll produce the final answer (Action: Answer). I will not run any commands until you give the database question.",
