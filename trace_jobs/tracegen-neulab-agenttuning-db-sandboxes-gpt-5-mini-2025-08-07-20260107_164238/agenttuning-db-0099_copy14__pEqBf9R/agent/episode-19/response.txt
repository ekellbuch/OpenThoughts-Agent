  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to run SQL, and no further SQL operations have been performed since the server started.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the exact question you want answered from the database. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own precise question):\n- \"Show tables in database <database_name>\" (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM database_name;)\n- \"Describe table <table_name> in database <database_name>\" (I would run: DESCRIBE database_name.table_name;)\n- \"Select rows from <table_name> where <condition>\" (I would run: SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;)\n- \"Count rows in table <table_name>\" (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM database_name.table_name;)\nWhen you provide the precise question and, if known, the target database and table names, I will: 1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and 2) either output Action: Operation with one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or output Action: Answer with the final answer if no DB operation is needed. I will run at most one SQL statement per round as requested.",
