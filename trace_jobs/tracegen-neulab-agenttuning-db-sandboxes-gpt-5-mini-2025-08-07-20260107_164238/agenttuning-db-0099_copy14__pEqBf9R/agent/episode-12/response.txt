A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application databases or tables have been inspected because you haven't provided a specific question or target database/table names yet. The environment is ready to run SQL, but no further operations have been performed.",

Examples you can ask for: - \"Show databases\" - \"Show tables in database <name>\" - \"Describe table <name> in database <name>\" - \"SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <condition>\" - \"Count rows in <table>\" Once you state the precise question (and target database/table names if known), I will (1) explain my understanding and the single SQL statement I plan to run, and (2) either perform one operation (outputting Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block for you to execute) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer) if no DB operation is needed. I will run at most one SQL statement each round as requested.",
