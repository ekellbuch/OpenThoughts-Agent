You successfully started mysqld (processes present) and the Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A SHOW DATABASES; query returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. So the environment is ready for further SQL operations. Nothing else has been changed in the databases beyond the initial SHOW DATABASES query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you ask a question about the data, I will (1) think through what SQL is required and explain my reasoning, (2) then choose to either operate (issue one SQL statement) or answer (provide the final answer). If I operate, I will output: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL statement in a single markdown code block (one line). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output. After you return the output, I'll parse it and continue. If I'm ready to finish and report final results, I'll output: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"ANS1\", ...]. Please provide the question you want answered from the database.",
