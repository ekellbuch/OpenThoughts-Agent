A prior test query (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been requested yet. Currently there is no pending SQL statement to run and I'm waiting for the specific SQL question you want answered against the database.",
  "plan": "I'll wait for your SQL question. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach to answer it, (2) describe the exact single SQL statement I will run, and (3) provide that single SQL statement inside the required 'Action: Operation' SQL code block so you can execute it and return the raw MySQL output. If you'd like to explore the database first, tell me which exploratory action you want (list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, show CREATE TABLE, run a SELECT, or modify data) and I will provide exactly one SQL statement for that action.",
