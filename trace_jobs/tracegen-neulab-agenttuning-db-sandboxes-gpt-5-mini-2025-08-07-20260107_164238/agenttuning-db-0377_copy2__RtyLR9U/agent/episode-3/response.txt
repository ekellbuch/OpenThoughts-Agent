  "analysis": "No MySQL server is currently running in the container and there were no environment variables or client config files pointing to a remote server. I installed the MySQL client earlier, but attempts to connect failed because the mysqld socket doesn't exist and nothing is listening on TCP 3306. To be able to run SQL statements from this shell, we need a running MySQL/MariaDB server. The next step is to install a server package and start it so the mysql client can connect and we can execute SQL.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL server package (default-mysql-server) so a server binary and init scripts are available. 2) Start the mysql service. 3) Verify the mysqld process is running and the socket exists. 4) Run a simple SQL statement (SHOW DATABASES;) as root to confirm connectivity. If the server uses socket-based auth for root (typical on Debian/Ubuntu), connecting as root without a password should succeed once the server is started.",
