A prior test connection as root returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been examined beyond that test. Currently there is no SQL question or requested operation from you, and no SQL has been executed since the check.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want to do next. Common next actions (each would be a single SQL statement I can provide for you to run) are:\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show CREATE TABLE: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Run a SELECT or aggregate (COUNT/SUM/AVG) — tell me the table/columns/conditions;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — give exact changes.\n\nTell me which action you want and provide any needed database/table names or query details. Once you choose, I will: (1) explain my reasoning, (2) provide a short plan of the SQL to run, and (3) give exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single SQL code block with one-line SQL) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
