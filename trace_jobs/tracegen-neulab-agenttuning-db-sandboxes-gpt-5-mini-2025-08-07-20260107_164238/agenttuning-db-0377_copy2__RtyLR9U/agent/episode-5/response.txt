(2) Describe a concrete plan of SQL operations I will run to obtain the needed data. (3) Then either: (a) perform an operation by returning a single SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed by 'Action: Operation' (you will run that and return the raw MySQL output), or (b) if no further operations are needed, return 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. I will only include one SQL statement per operation and will wait for your execution result before continuing.",
