A test connection as root succeeded previously and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet and there is currently no SQL question or operation pending from you.",
  "plan": "I'm waiting for your specific SQL question or instruction. When you provide it I will: (1) Explain my understanding of the question and the SQL approach I will use. (2) Describe the concrete SQL statement(s) needed. (3) Then either (a) perform an operation by returning exactly one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block prefixed with 'Action: Operation' (one-line SQL) for you to execute and paste the raw MySQL output back to me, or (b) if the answer is already determinable, return 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. If you want me to discover database/table names first, say so and I will issue the one-line SQL to list databases or tables.",
