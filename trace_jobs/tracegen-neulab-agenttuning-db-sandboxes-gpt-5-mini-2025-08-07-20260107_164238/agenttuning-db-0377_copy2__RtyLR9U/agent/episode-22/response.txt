  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A previous test as root returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been examined beyond that test. There is currently no SQL question or operation from you and nothing further has been executed since the connectivity check.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want to do next. Common next actions (each will be provided as a single SQL statement for you to run) are:\n- List all databases (SHOW DATABASES;)\n- List tables in a specific database (SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;)\n- Describe a table's columns (DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;)\n- Show CREATE TABLE (SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;)\n- Run a SELECT or aggregate (you provide table/columns/conditions)\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE — provide exact changes)\n\nTell me which action you want and provide any required database/table names or query details. Once you choose, I will: (1) explain my reasoning, (2) give a short plan of the SQL to run, and (3) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (one-line SQL in a markdown SQL code block) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer.",
