  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. mysqld is running (processes present) and the Unix socket files exist at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous test connection as root succeeded and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been explored yet. There is currently no SQL question or operation provided by you, and nothing further has been executed since the server check and test query.",
  "plan": "I'm waiting for you to give the specific SQL question or the exploratory action you want me to perform. Pick one of these options (and supply a database/table name if needed):\n\n- List all databases (I will run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- List tables in a specific database (I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;)\n- Describe a table's columns (I will run: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;)\n- Show CREATE TABLE for a table (I will run: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;)\n- Run a SELECT query (tell me the table, columns, and any WHERE/GROUP/BY/LIMIT you want)\n- Run an aggregate (COUNT/SUM/AVG) — tell me the target table/column and filters\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — give exact changes you want made\n\nWhen you choose an action, I will: (1) explain my reasoning and the exact SQL needed, and (2) provide a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by one SQL code block containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute that single SQL block and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final answer. If you want me to run shell-level commands instead (for example, to create a DB user or start/stop the server), tell me explicitly and I will provide the shell commands in the same format as before.",
