  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running inside the container. mysqld processes are active and socket files exist at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and /var/run/mysqld/mysqlx.sock. A test connection as root succeeded earlier and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected beyond that. There is currently no SQL question or operation pending from you.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific SQL question. When you provide it I will: (1) explain my understanding and the approach to answer it, (2) give a short plan of which tables/columns to query or what modifications to make, and (3) either perform an operation by returning a single SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed with 'Action: Operation' (one-line SQL) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or, if ready to commit the final answer, return 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. If you'd like to explore the database first, tell me which exploratory action you want (list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, or run a specific SELECT) and I will provide the single SQL statement to run.",
