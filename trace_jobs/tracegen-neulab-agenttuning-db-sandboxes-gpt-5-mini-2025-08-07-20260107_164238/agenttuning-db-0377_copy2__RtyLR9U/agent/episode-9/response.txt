  "plan": "Wait for your specific SQL question. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and the approach to answer it. 2) Describe the exact SQL I will run. 3) Provide a single SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed by 'Action: Operation' (one-line SQL). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will parse it and either issue another operation or provide the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to run shell commands instead, tell me explicitly and I will provide the required shell commands.",
