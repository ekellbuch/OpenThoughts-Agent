  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. mysqld is running (processes present) and the socket files exist at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and /var/run/mysqld/mysqlx.sock. A prior test query (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been requested yet. There is currently no SQL question from you and no pending SQL to execute.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific SQL question you want answered. To help you choose, here are the common next steps I can run (each would be a single SQL statement I will provide for you to execute):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database (example for database `mydb`): SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;\n- Describe a table's columns (example for `mytable` in `mydb`): DESCRIBE mydb.mytable;\n- Show CREATE statement for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable;\n- Run a SELECT query to get data or aggregated results: SELECT ... FROM mydb.mytable WHERE ...;\n\nTell me which action you want, or ask your question (for example: \"List all tables in database X\", or \"Count rows in table Y\", or a specific query). I will then: (1) explain my reasoning, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (one-line SQL in a markdown SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output. If you prefer, tell me to proceed with an exploratory step (e.g., list databases) and I will provide that single SQL operation.",
