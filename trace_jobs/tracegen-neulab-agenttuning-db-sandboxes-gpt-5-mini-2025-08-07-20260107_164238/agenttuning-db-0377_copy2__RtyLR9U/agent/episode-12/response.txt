A test connection as root succeeded earlier and SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been requested yet. There is currently no pending SQL action from you — I'm waiting for the specific question you want answered against the database.",
  "plan": "Wait for your SQL question. When you provide it I will: (1) Explain my understanding of the question and the SQL approach to answer it. (2) Describe the exact single SQL statement I will run. (3) Provide that one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block prefixed with 'Action: Operation' (one-line SQL) for you to execute. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse the output, continue reasoning, and either issue another operation or provide the final answer using the 'Action: Answer' format. If you want exploratory steps first, tell me which of the following you want me to run and I will issue exactly one SQL statement for that action: - list databases, - list tables in a given database, - show CREATE TABLE for a table, - run a specific SELECT/COUNT/aggregation query, or - modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).",
