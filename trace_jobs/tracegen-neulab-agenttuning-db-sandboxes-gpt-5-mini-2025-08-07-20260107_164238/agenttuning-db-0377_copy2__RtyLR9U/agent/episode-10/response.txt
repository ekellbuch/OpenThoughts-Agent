A test connection as root succeeded earlier and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific database queries have been run yet. There is currently no pending SQL statement to execute from me — I'm waiting for your specific SQL question or instruction.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the SQL question or the next instruction. When you provide the question I will: (1) Explain my understanding of the question and the reasoning I'll use to answer it. (2) Describe the exact SQL needed to obtain the answer. (3) Then either: (a) perform an operation by returning a single SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed with 'Action: Operation' (one-line SQL) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output, or (b) if the answer can be determined from existing results, return 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. I will only include one SQL statement per operation as required.",
