When you provide a question I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and the SQL needed to answer it. 2) Describe a short plan of which tables/columns to query or how to modify data. 3) Either perform an operation by returning a single SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block prefixed with 'Action: Operation' (you will run that and return the output), or, if no DB operation is required, return 'Action: Answer' with the final answer. I will only include one SQL statement per operation and will wait for your execution result before continuing.",
