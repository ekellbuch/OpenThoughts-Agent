  "analysis": "You are in a container shell (root@a3a1c3416b9b:/app#). No commands have been run yet. There's no visible MySQL activity in the terminal output. To answer future SQL questions I need to discover whether MySQL is installed/running, locate the socket/files, and attempt to connect so I can run SQL statements you ask for. At this point nothing has been accomplished toward accessing the database.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a running mysqld process to see if the server is running. 2) Check the mysql client version (to ensure client is present). 3) Inspect common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) to find sockets/configs. 4) Attempt a non-interactive connection as root and run a simple SQL statement (SHOW DATABASES;) to see accessible databases. If that succeeds, we'll be ready to run the specific SQL statement you request next. Each command is chosen to be quick and give the required info: ps to find process, mysql --version to confirm client, ls to find files/sockets, then mysql -uroot -e to run a single SQL statement and print results.",
