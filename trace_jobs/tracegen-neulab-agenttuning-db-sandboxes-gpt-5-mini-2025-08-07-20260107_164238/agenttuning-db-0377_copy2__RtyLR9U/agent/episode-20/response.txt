A prior test connection as root returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected beyond that test. There is currently no SQL question or requested operation from you.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me what you want to do next. Choose one of the following actions (and provide any needed database/table names) and I will: (1) explain my approach and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions:\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show CREATE TABLE: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Run a SELECT or aggregate (COUNT/SUM/AVG): specify table/columns/conditions;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE): provide exact change to perform.\n\nTell me which action you want (and any database/table names). If you prefer I can first run a discovery step (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;) — tell me which discovery step to run and I will provide the single SQL operation.",
