A test connection as root returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been explored beyond that test. There is currently no SQL question or requested operation from you, and I haven't executed any further SQL since the connectivity check.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database action you want next. Pick one of the options below (and provide any needed database/table names or query details). After you pick, I will: (1) explain my approach, (2) provide a short plan of the SQL to run, and (3) give exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single one-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions you can request now:\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a specific database (provide database name): SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table's columns (provide database and table): DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show CREATE TABLE for a table (provide database and table): SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Run a SELECT query (provide database.table, columns, WHERE/GROUP/BY/LIMIT details);\n- Run an aggregate (e.g., COUNT) — provide table, column and filters;\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — provide exact changes you want made.\n\nIf you want exploratory discovery, say for example: \"List tables in database mysql\" or simply \"SHOW DATABASES\" and I'll provide the single SQL statement to run.",
