  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL server and client. mysqld is running (process list shows mysqld processes) and the Unix socket exists at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. A previous test query as root returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected beyond that test. There is currently no SQL question or operation from you and no pending SQL statements to execute.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific SQL question or the exploratory action you'd like me to perform. Pick one and I will (1) explain the approach, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (one-line) inside an 'Action: Operation' SQL code block for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output. Possible next actions (choose one and supply a database/table name if needed):\n- List all databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table's columns: DESCRIBE your_database.your_table;\n- Show CREATE statement for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Run a SELECT/COUNT/SUM/AVG query (provide table, columns, filters);\n- Modify data (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — provide exact changes.\nWhen you tell me which action to run, I'll provide the single SQL statement in the required format.",
