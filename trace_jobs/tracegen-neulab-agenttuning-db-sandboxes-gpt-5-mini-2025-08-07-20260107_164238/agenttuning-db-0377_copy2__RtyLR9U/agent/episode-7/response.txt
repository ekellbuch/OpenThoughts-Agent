Once you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding and reasoning about how to answer it. 2) Describe the exact SQL I will run to obtain the required data. 3) Either (a) perform an operation by returning a single SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block prefixed with 'Action: Operation' (you will execute that and return the raw MySQL output), or (b) if I'm ready to commit the final answer based on prior outputs, return 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. I will only include one SQL statement per operation as required.",
