The server is running (mysqld processes present) and the socket files exist at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and /var/run/mysqld/mysqlx.sock. A test connection as root succeeded: SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. There are no visible application-specific databases yet. At this point the MySQL server is up and accessible from this shell as root using socket-based auth.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your SQL question. When you ask it, I will: 1) Think through the question and explain my reasoning and approach in the 'analysis' and 'plan' fields. 2) Then either (a) operate — provide exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block (one-line SQL) labeled with 'Action: Operation' so you execute it and return the output to me; or (b) if I'm ready to commit a final answer based on prior results, provide 'Action: Answer' followed by Final Answer: [ ... ].\n\nNotes about running SQL here: you will execute the first SQL code block I provide. I will only include a single SQL statement in that block. After you run it and supply the output, I'll parse the raw MySQL response, continue reasoning, and either issue another operation or give the final answer. For now, since you haven't provided a specific question yet, I will not execute any further commands and will wait for your question.",
