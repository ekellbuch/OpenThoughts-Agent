The mysqld process is active (shown in ps) and socket files exist at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and mysqlx.sock.

  "plan": "Wait for your specific SQL question. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and the SQL approach to answer it. 2) Provide a single SQL statement (one line) inside a markdown SQL code block preceded by 'Action: Operation' for you to execute. You will run that single SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either issue another operation or return the final answer as required. If you want me to run commands in the shell (e.g., to create/start/stop DB, or run mysql client directly), tell me explicitly and I will provide the shell commands in the required format.",
