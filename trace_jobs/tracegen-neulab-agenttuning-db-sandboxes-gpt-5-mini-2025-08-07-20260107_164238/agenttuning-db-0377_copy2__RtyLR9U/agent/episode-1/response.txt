  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client or server accessible. Previous commands show no mysqld process and the mysql client is not installed (bash: mysql: command not found). The common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) returned nothing visible. To run SQL statements against a MySQL server from this shell we need a MySQL client. It's possible a server isn't running in this container; at minimum the client is missing.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether apt-get is available for installing a MySQL client. 2) If apt-get is available, update package lists and install the default-mysql-client package so we can run mysql commands. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed. 4) Attempt a simple non-interactive connection (SHOW DATABASES;) as root to see if a server is reachable without a password. If the server requires credentials or is not running, we'll report that and wait for your next SQL instruction or credentials. Commands: detect package manager, apt-get update, apt-get install default-mysql-client, verify mysql --version, then run mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to test connectivity.",
