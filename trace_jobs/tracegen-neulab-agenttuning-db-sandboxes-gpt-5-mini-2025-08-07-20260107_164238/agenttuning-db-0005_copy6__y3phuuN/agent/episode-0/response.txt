There's no direct information about a MySQL server or the database schema yet. Before running any SQL I'll need to confirm whether the MySQL client is available, whether a MySQL server process is running in the container, and whether any environment variables or socket files indicate how to connect. I will not run any SQL until you ask the specific question or until I confirm connection details.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). 2) Check for a running mysqld process. 3) Inspect the MySQL runtime socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) and MySQL configuration directory (/etc/mysql) to find connection info. 4) Look for environment variables that may contain MySQL credentials/connection info. After these checks I'll report results and ask you for the question or attempt a connection (and then I'll follow the SQL operation format you requested).",
