  "analysis": "I am root in the container. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). There are no running MySQL/MariaDB processes and none of the typical MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) exist. That means there is currently no local MySQL server or client available. To proceed I must either locate an existing MySQL installation or configuration (socket file, .my.cnf with credentials, remote host env vars, or installed packages) or install a MySQL/MariaDB client so I can connect to a database (local or remote).",
  "plan": "1) Probe for any MySQL-related binaries that might exist under other names (mariadb, mysqladmin, mysqld). 2) Check environment variables and common config files for connection info (~/.my.cnf, /etc/my.cnf). 3) Search for any mysql socket files or .my.cnf elsewhere on the filesystem. 4) Inspect installed packages for MySQL/MariaDB to see if server/client is present. 5) If no client is available, attempt to install a MySQL client package so I can run SQL. If installation fails or is not permitted, report back and request connection details (host, port, user, password) or your next instruction. The commands below implement these steps. I expect to find either a client or credentials/config; if not, apt-get install will attempt to provide a client.",
