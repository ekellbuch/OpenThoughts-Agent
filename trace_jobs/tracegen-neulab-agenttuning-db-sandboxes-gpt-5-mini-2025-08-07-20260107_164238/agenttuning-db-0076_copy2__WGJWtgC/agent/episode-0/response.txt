I need to discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is installed and running, locate the socket/data files, and attempt a simple connection to verify access. After that I will wait for your question or run specific SQL you request.",
  "plan": "1) Check the current user. 2) See if the mysql client binary is available and its version. 3) Look for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 4) List typical MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) to find sockets and data. 5) Attempt a quick connection using the mysql client (as root with no password) to run a simple SELECT VERSION() to verify connectivity. Based on results I will report what I found and then you can ask the specific database question or I will run further SQL as you instruct.",
