Choose one and provide any database/table names or conditions as needed:\n- List tables in a database: supply the database name (I will provide: Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;).\n- Show a table's schema: supply database.table (I will provide: Action: Operation with SHOW CREATE TABLE database.table;).\n- Show rows from a table: supply database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT (I will provide: Action: Operation with a SELECT query).\n- Count rows or aggregate: supply database.table and condition (I will provide: Action: Operation with SELECT COUNT(*) ...).\n- Run a custom query or modify data: describe precisely what you want.\n\nWhen you pick an action and supply names/conditions, I will return exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and either produce another single SQL statement or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
