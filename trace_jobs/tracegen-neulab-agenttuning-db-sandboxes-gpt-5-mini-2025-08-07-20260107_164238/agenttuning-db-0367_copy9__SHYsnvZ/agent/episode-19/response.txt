  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server. Earlier steps installed the client and server and confirmed that SHOW DATABASES returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected beyond that. The shell is currently idle and no further SQL has been executed because you have not specified what database question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands right now. I need you to tell me exactly which database question or operation you want performed. Provide one of the following (include database/table names or conditions as needed):\n- List tables in a database (reply with the database name).\n- Show a table's schema (reply with database.table).\n- Show rows from a table (reply with database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT).\n- Count rows or aggregate (reply with database.table and condition).\n- Run a custom query or modify data (describe precisely what you want).\n\nOnce you specify the action and any required names/conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and containing a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
