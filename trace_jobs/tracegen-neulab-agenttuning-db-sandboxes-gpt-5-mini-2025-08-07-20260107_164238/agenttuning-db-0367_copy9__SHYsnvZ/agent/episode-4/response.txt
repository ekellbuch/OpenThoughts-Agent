Once you provide the question or select one of the suggested next steps, I will: 1) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' markdown format (single-line SQL inside a fenced code block) for you to execute, 2) explain why that statement answers your question, and 3) after you run it and return the raw MySQL output, parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or — if finished — provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you prefer, pick one of these actions now: a) List tables in a database (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;), b) Describe table structure (SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table;), c) Show rows (SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10;), d) Run a specific query you describe. Tell me which you want.",
