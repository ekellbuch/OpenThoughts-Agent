Examples: (1) list tables in a specific database, (2) show rows from a particular table with a condition, (3) count rows, (4) show table schema, or any custom query. Once you tell me the question or pick one of the example actions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block preceded by the text 'Action: Operation'. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either provide a follow-up single SQL or, if finished, produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
