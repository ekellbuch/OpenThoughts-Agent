  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A previous SHOW DATABASES (run as root) returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected beyond that. The shell is idle and awaiting a specific database question or operation from you. I cannot run any SQL beyond this point until you specify what you want queried or modified.",
  "plan": "Tell me exactly which database question or operation you want performed. Examples (provide database/table names or conditions where applicable):\n- List tables in a database: provide the database name (I will return a single SQL statement: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;).\n- Show a table's schema: provide database.table (I will return: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;).\n- Show rows from a table: provide database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT (I will return a SELECT query, e.g., SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;).\n- Count rows or aggregate: provide database.table and condition (I will return: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;).\n- Custom query or data modification: describe precisely what you want.\n\nOnce you specify the action and any required names/conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and with the SQL in a single fenced code block on one line). You will run that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide a follow-up single SQL statement or, if finished, give the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
