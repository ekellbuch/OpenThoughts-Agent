A prior SHOW DATABASES (run as root) returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected. The shell is idle and waiting for further instruction. I cannot run any meaningful SQL until you tell me what you want to query or modify in the database (for example: list tables, show rows, count rows, describe schema, or run a custom query).",

You can choose one of these and provide any database/table names or conditions needed:\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table's schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows or aggregate: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Custom query or data modification (describe precisely).\n\nAfter you specify the action and provide any names/conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" with the SQL in a single fenced code block on one line). You will run that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or — if finished — give the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
