  "analysis": "The mysql client is now installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no MySQL server running: attempts to connect returned ERROR 2002 (Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'). To proceed with executing SQL I need a running MySQL server (either local or remote). Since no remote connection details were provided, the next step is to install and start a local MySQL server in this container so I can run SQL against it.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL server package non-interactively (default-mysql-server) so a local server is available. 2) Start the mysql service. 3) Verify the server process is running. 4) Run a single SQL statement to list databases: SHOW DATABASES; — this will confirm the server accepts connections and reveal available schemas for further operations. If starting the server fails, I will report the error output so you can provide alternate instructions or credentials for a remote server.",
