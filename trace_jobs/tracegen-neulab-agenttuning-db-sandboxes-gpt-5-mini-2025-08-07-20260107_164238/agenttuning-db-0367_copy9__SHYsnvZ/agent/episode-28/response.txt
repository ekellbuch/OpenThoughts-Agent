Pick one of these options (and provide any names/values required):\n\n1) Inspect existing objects — give a database name or database.table and I will produce the single SQL to list tables or select rows.\n2) Create a sample database/table and insert data here — give a database name, table column definitions and a couple of sample rows and I will produce the single CREATE/INSERT SQL to run.\n3) Connect/query a remote server — provide host, port, user, and password and I will produce a single connection/test SQL for you to run.\n4) Run a specific query (COUNT, aggregate, filter, join, update, delete, etc.) — describe the query and target table and I will produce the single SQL statement.\n\nWhen you choose, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" with the SQL inside a single fenced code block on one line). You will run that single SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either issue another single SQL or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
