There is no information yet about whether a MySQL server is running or what credentials to use. Before answering any database question or running SQL, I need to: (1) verify the mysql client is available, (2) check whether a mysqld server process is running and where its socket/data directory is, and (3) attempt a connection (likely as root) to list databases so I can see what schemas/tables exist. After that I'll wait for the MySQL output and then craft the SQL in the required \"Action: Operation\" markdown format for subsequent single-statement execution rounds.",
  "plan": "1) Check mysql client availability with `mysql --version`. 2) Check for a running mysqld process. 3) List common MySQL runtime/data directories (/var/run/mysqld and /var/lib/mysql) to find sockets or database files. 4) Try connecting as root and run a simple one-line statement to show databases: SHOW DATABASES; This will reveal available databases so I can plan the next SQL operation. Each command is chosen to gather information; the mysql -e invocation will run a one-line statement and return results. After you return the MySQL output I will (per your instruction) present the next SQL to execute in the required \"Action: Operation\" markdown format.",
