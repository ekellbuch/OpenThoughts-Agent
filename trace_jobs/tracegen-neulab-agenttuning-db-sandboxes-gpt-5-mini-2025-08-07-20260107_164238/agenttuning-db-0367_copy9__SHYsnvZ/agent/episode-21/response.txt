A prior SHOW DATABASES (run as root) returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected beyond that.

  "plan": "I will not execute any commands until you tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. Please choose one of the options below and supply any required names/conditions (database name, table name, WHERE clause, LIMIT, etc.). Once you choose, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to run and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (pick one and provide names/conditions as needed):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table's schema/DDL: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows (optionally with condition): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\n- List all non-system tables: SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys');\n- Run a custom query: describe precisely what you want (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) including table and condition details.\n\nTell me which action you want and the needed identifiers/conditions. I will then output exactly one SQL statement in the required markdown 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue with the next single SQL or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
