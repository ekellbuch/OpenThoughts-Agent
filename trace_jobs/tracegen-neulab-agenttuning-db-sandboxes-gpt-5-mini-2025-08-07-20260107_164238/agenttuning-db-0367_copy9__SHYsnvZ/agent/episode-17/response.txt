  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which database question or operation you want performed. Pick one and provide any database/table names or conditions as needed. Example choices:\n- List tables in a database: provide the database name (I will produce: Action: Operation with a single-line SQL: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;).\n- Show a table's schema: provide database.table (I will produce: Action: Operation with: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;).\n- Show rows from a table: provide database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT (I will produce: Action: Operation with: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;).\n- Count rows or aggregate: provide database.table and condition (I will produce: Action: Operation with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;).\n- Custom query or data modification: describe precisely what you want and I will produce one SQL statement.\n\nOnce you specify which action and supply any required names/conditions, I will return exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and containing a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will run that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or, if finished, give the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
