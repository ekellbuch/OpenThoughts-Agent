Earlier I installed the client and server and successfully ran SHOW DATABASES, which returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-created databases or tables have been inspected. The shell is idle and waiting for your instruction. I cannot run further SQL until you tell me exactly what you want queried or modified (database/table names and any WHERE/LIMIT/aggregation details).",
  "plan": "I will not execute any commands right now. Please tell me the precise database question or operation you want performed. Choose one of these options and provide any names/conditions required:\n- List tables in a database: provide the database name.\n- Show a table's schema: provide database.table.\n- Show rows from a table: provide database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT.\n- Count rows or aggregate: provide database.table and condition.\n- Run a custom query or modify data: describe exactly what you want.\n\nAfter you specify the action and supply any database/table names or conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and containing a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will execute that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either produce another single SQL statement or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
