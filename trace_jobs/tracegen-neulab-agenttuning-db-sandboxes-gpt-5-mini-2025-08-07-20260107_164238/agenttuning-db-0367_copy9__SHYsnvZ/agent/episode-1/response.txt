  "analysis": "The container currently does not have a MySQL client or server installed. Previous commands show: 'mysql: command not found', no mysqld process, and the common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql) are absent. Nothing has been done yet to connect to a database. To proceed I need a MySQL client to run SQL statements; installing a client is the next logical step. After that I'll attempt to connect (likely to a local server if present or to a remote host if you provide connection details) and run SHOW DATABASES to discover available schemas.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) non-interactively. 3) Verify the client is installed by running mysql --version. 4) Attempt a simple connection to show databases with mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\". If a local server isn't available or authentication fails, I'll report the error output and request connection credentials or a running MySQL server. Each command is explicit and will produce output for the next step.",
