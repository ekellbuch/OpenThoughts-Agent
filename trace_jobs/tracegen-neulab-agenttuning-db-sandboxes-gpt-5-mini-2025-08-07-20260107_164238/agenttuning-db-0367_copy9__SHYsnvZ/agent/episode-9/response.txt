  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server. A previous attempt to SHOW DATABASES returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected yet. The shell is idle and no further SQL has been executed because you haven't specified what you want queried or modified.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can pick (provide database and table names or conditions as needed):\n- List tables in a database (tell me the database name).\n- Show the schema/DDL for a table (provide database.table).\n- Show rows from a table (provide database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT).\n- Count rows or perform an aggregate (provide database.table and condition).\n- Run a custom SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT (describe exactly what you want).\n\nWhen you tell me which action and supply any names/conditions, I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and with the SQL in a single fenced code block on one line). You will run that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back to me; I will parse it and either produce another single SQL statement or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.\n- Answer: If you only wanted guidance and no SQL execution, tell me and I'll provide the answer or steps verbally.\n\nTell me which of the example actions (or provide your own) you want to perform and include any database/table names or conditions. I will then produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
