No user databases or tables have been inspected yet. To answer most database questions we first need to discover whether any non-system databases or tables exist. Once we know what databases/tables are present, we can run table-level or row-level queries as you request.",

This will reveal any user-created databases and their tables so you can tell me which one(s) to inspect further. Run the following single SQL statement and paste back the raw MySQL output. I expect rows showing table_schema and table_name for each non-system table, or no rows if there are none.\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','performance_schema','information_schema','sys') ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;\n```\n\nAfter you run it and provide the output, I'll parse it and propose the next single SQL statement (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM a specific database or SELECT rows from a table).",
