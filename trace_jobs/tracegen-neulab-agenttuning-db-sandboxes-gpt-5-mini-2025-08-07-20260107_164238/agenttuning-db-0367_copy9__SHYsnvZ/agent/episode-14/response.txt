Please tell me one of the following (and provide the database/table names or conditions where applicable):\n\n- List tables in a database (provide database name). Example SQL I'll produce: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show a table's schema (provide database.table). Example SQL I'll produce: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table (provide database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT). Example SQL I'll produce: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows or aggregate (provide database.table and condition). Example SQL I'll produce: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\n- A custom query or data modification (describe precisely what you want).\n\nWhen you pick an action and give any names/conditions, I will return exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will execute that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide a follow-up single SQL or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
