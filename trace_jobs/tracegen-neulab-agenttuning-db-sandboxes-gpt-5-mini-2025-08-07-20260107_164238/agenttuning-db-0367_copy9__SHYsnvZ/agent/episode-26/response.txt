Choose one of these options and provide any names/values required: \n\n- Inspect existing objects: provide a database name or database.table and I will produce a single SQL statement to list tables (SHOW TABLES FROM db;) or to select rows (SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10;).\n- Create schema/data: provide the new database name, table column definitions, and sample rows and I will produce a single CREATE DATABASE/CREATE TABLE or INSERT statement for you to run.\n- Connect to a remote server: provide host, port, user, and password (if applicable) and I will produce a single connection/test SQL for you to run.\n- Run a specific query (COUNT, aggregate, filter, join, update, delete, etc.): describe the query and target table and I will produce the single SQL statement.\n\nWhen you pick one action and supply any required identifiers/conditions/data, I will return exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and containing a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will execute that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue with the next single SQL or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
