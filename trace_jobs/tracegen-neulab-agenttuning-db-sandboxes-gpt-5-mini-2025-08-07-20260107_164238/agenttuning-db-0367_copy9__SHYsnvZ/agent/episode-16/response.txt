  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. A previous SHOW DATABASES (run as root) returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been inspected. The shell is idle and waiting for your instruction. I cannot run any further SQL until you tell me exactly what you want queried or modified (for example: list tables in a database, show rows from a table, count rows, show table schema, or run a custom query).",
  "plan": "Ask you to specify the exact database action you want. Provide one of the following (and include database/table names or conditions as needed):\n- List tables in a database (reply with the database name).\n- Show a table's schema (reply with database.table).\n- Show rows from a table (reply with database.table and optional WHERE or LIMIT).\n- Count rows or aggregate (reply with database.table and condition).\n- A custom query or data modification (describe precisely what you want).\n\nOnce you specify the action and any names/conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will run that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue with the next single SQL or give the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
