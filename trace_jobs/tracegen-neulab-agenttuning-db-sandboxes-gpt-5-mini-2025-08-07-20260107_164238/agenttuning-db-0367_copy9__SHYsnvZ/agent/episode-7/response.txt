After you choose, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single fenced SQL code block containing a one-line SQL statement). You will run that SQL and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either ask for another single SQL operation or, if finished, provide the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. Choose one of these now and provide any names/conditions needed: 1) List tables in a database (provide database name). 2) Describe table schema (provide database.table). 3) Show rows (provide database.table and optional LIMIT/WHERE). 4) Run a count or aggregate (provide database.table and condition). 5) A custom query (describe it).",
