Examples you can choose (and please provide database/table names or conditions as needed):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows or aggregate: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Run a custom query or modify data (describe it precisely).\n\nOnce you tell me which action and supply the database/table names or conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" with the SQL in a single fenced code block on one line). You will execute that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either issue a follow-up single SQL operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
