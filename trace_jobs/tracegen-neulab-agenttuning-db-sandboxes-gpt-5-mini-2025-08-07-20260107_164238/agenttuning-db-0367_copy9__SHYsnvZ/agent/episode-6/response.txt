After you pick, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run and return the raw MySQL output. Example actions you can choose from: (A) List tables in a database — I will give: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; (B) Show table schema — I will give: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table; (C) Show some rows — I will give: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10; (D) Count rows with a condition — I will give: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition; or (E) provide your own custom query description. Tell me which action (and the database/table/condition names) you want, and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
