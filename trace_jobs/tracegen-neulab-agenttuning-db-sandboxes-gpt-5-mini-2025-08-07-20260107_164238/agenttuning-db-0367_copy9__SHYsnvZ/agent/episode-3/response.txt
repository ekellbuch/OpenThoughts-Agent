  "plan": "I need you to tell me the actual question you want answered from the database (for example: list tables in a specific database, show rows from a table matching a condition, count records, etc.). Based on your question I will: (A) produce one single SQL statement (in the required markdown 'Action: Operation' format) for you to execute, (B) explain why this SQL answers your question, and (C) after you run it and provide the raw MySQL output, I will parse that output and either produce a follow-up SQL or, if finished, provide the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. If you don't know what to ask next, here are common next-step options I can run for you (pick one): 1) Show databases (already done). 2) List tables in a database (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;). 3) Show create table for a table (SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;). 4) Query rows (SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;). Tell me which of these (or provide your own question) and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
