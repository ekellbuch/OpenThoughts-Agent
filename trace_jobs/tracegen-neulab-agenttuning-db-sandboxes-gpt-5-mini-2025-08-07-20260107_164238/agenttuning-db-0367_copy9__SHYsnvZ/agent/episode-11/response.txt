A prior SHOW DATABASES (run as root) returned only the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been examined. The shell is idle and awaiting further instruction. I cannot run any meaningful SQL until you tell me what you want to query or modify in the database (e.g., list tables in a database, show rows from a table, count rows, describe a table, run a custom query, etc.).",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands right now. Please tell me exactly which database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can choose (include database/table names or conditions as needed):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows or aggregate: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\n- Run a custom query or modify data (describe precisely).\n\nOnce you specify the action and any names/conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and with a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will execute that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either return another single SQL operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact \"Action: Answer\" pattern.",
