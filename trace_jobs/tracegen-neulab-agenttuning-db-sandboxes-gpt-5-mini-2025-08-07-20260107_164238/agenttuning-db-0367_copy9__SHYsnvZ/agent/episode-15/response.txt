Pick one and provide any necessary names/conditions (database, table, WHERE, LIMIT):\n\n1) List tables in a database — I will give: Action: Operation with a single-line SQL: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n2) Show a table's schema — I will give: Action: Operation with: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n3) Show rows from a table — I will give: Action: Operation with: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n4) Count rows or aggregate — I will give: Action: Operation with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;\n5) Custom query or data modification — describe exactly what you want and I will produce one SQL statement.\n\nOnce you tell me which action and supply names/conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and a single fenced code block containing a one-line SQL). You will execute that one statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
