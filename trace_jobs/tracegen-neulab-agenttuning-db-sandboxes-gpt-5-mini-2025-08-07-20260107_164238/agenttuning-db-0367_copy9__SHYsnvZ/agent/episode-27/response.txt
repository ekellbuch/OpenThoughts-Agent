  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server. I previously confirmed SHOW DATABASES and queried information_schema for non-system tables; there are currently no user-created databases or tables (only information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The server is accessible as root without a password. The terminal is idle and awaiting your instruction about what to do next.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly which database action you want performed. Pick one of the options below and provide any names/values required; I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions (examples):\n- List tables in a database: provide the database name (I will give: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;).\n- Show a table's schema: provide database.table (I will give: SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;).\n- Show rows from a table: provide database.table and optional WHERE/LIMIT (I will give: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;).\n- Count rows or aggregate: provide database.table and condition (I will give: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition;).\n- Create a database/table and insert data here: provide the database name, table columns, and sample rows (I will give the CREATE TABLE or INSERT statement).\n- Connect/query a remote server: provide host, port, user, and password (I will give the appropriate single connection/test SQL).\n\nTell me which option you want and the necessary identifiers/conditions. If you are unsure, I can create a sample database and table here — tell me the table schema and a couple of sample rows to insert and I will produce the single SQL to run.",
