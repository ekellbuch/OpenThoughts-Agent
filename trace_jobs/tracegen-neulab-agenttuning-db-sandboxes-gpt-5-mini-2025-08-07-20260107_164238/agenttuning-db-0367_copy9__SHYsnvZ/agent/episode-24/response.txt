  "analysis": "I ran a query against information_schema.tables to list any non-system tables and received no output — there are currently no user-created databases/tables on this MySQL server. Only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys) exist. The server is running and accessible as root without a password, so we can create databases/tables, import data, or run further inspection queries if you specify what you want.",
  "plan": "You can choose what to do next. Options:\n1) If you want to inspect something specific on a remote or different server, provide connection details (host, port, user, password) and I'll produce the single SQL to run. \n2) If you want to explore/prepare data here, I can create a new database and table and insert sample rows — tell me the schema and sample data and I'll produce the single CREATE or INSERT statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute.\n3) If you want to run another discovery query (e.g., show tables in a system schema or describe server status), tell me which query and I'll produce the single SQL operation in the required format.\n\nTell me which option you want and provide any names/credentials/data needed. I will then give exactly one SQL statement (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and a single one-line SQL inside a fenced code block) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue or finish with an exact \"Action: Answer\" final response if appropriate.",
