Please choose one of the following and supply any names/values needed:\n\n- Inspect a schema/table: give a database name or database.table and I will produce a single SQL to list tables or show rows.\n- Create a database/table and insert data: provide the desired schema (database and table columns) and sample rows and I will produce the single CREATE/INSERT SQL to run.\n- Import or connect to a remote server: provide host, port, user, and password and I will produce the single connection/test SQL.\n- Run a specific query (COUNT, SELECT with WHERE, etc.): describe the query and target table.\n\nWhen you tell me which action and provide any required names/credentials/data, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL inside a fenced code block). You will run that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or, if finished, give the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.",
