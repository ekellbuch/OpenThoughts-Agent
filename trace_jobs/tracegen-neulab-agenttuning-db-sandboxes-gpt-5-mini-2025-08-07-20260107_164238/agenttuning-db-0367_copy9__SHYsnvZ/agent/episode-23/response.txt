The MySQL client and server are installed and running as root with no password, so I can run the query from the shell directly. This will reveal any user-created databases and their tables so we can decide the next inspection steps.",

The statement will query information_schema.tables for all schemas except the default system schemas and order the results. I expect zero or more rows showing table_schema and table_name. After you return the raw MySQL output from this command, I'll parse it and propose the next single SQL operation (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM a discovered database or SELECT rows from a table).",
