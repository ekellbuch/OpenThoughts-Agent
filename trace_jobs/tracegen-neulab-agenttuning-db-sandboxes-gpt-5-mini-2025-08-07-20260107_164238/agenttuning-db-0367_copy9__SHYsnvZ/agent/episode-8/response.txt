A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases/tables have been inspected yet.

I need you to specify the exact database question or operation you want (for example: list tables in a specific database, show rows from a specific table with an optional WHERE clause, count rows, show table schema, etc.). Once you provide the question and any database/table names or conditions, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n\n- It will be preceded by the text: Action: Operation\n- The SQL will be inside a single fenced code block and be one line only\n\nYou will run that single SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. I will then parse the output and either produce another single SQL statement to run or — if finished — provide the final answer in the exact required pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease tell me which operation you want and provide any database, table, or condition details.",
