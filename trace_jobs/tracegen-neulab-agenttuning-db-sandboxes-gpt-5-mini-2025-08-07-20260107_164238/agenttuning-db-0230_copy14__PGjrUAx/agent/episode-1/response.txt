  "analysis": "So far I'm in a minimal container at /app as root. There is no mysql client binary installed (mysql: command not found), no local MySQL server process, and no MySQL data or config directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist). There's also no root MySQL client config file (/root/.my.cnf). Nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to a database yet. To run SQL I need either (A) a MySQL client binary to connect to a remote or local server, or (B) a MySQL server running locally. At minimum I should install a client or locate connection info (environment variables or files) that provide host, port, user, and password for an existing server.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client so I can connect to any MySQL server (local or remote). I'll use apt-get to install the default MySQL client package. 2) Re-check mysql --version to confirm installation. 3) Look for environment variables or files that might contain database connection info (common Docker-linked env vars or .sql files). 4) Check for any process listening on the MySQL port (3306) to see if a server is reachable locally. 5) If I discover connection details I will ask you or proceed to run the SQL you request. Commands below implement these steps. I expect apt-get update/install to install the client, after which mysql --version will show the client version. The environment and find checks will reveal any potential DB host/credentials if present.",
