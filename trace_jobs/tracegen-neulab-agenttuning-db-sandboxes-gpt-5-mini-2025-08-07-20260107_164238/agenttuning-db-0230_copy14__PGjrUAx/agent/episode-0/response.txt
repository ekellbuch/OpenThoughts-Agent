  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt as root in /app inside a container. There is no active MySQL session shown in the terminal output. No commands have been run yet in this session. To answer database questions I need to locate the MySQL client/binaries, determine whether a MySQL server is running locally, and discover any local configuration or data directories (or client login credentials) so I can connect and run SQL. Currently nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to or querying a database.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current directory and identity (quick checks). 2) Check for mysql client binary and its version. 3) Check whether a mysqld server process is running. 4) Inspect common MySQL server and data directories (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) to see if a local server exists and to find configuration or socket. 5) Check for a client configuration file (/root/.my.cnf) that might contain credentials. These steps will let me decide how to connect (socket vs TCP, credentials). I will run each command one at a time and inspect the outputs before proceeding to any SQL operation.",
