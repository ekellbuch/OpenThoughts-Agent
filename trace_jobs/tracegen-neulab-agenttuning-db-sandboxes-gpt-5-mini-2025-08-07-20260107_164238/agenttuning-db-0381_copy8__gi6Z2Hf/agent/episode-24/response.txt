  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container (mysqld process present and mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'). The mysql client is available. I ran SHOW DATABASES; which returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user databases or application data present, so no question about user data can be answered yet. The environment is ready to run SQL locally as root via the socket (mysql -u root) or to connect to a remote server if you provide credentials.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do next and provide any necessary details. I will then follow your rule: first explain the approach, then (if you request an Operation) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled 'Action: Operation'. Options:\n\n1) Provide a SQL question for an existing server: give the question and, if it's for a remote server, provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I'll explain the SQL and then output one Action: Operation for you to run.\n\n2) Import a dump you provide: paste the SQL dump or give a file path. I can import it into a new local database and then run queries you request.\n\n3) Create a local test database and sample tables here: specify DB name, table schemas and sample rows (or say 'create a simple sample schema'). If you confirm, I'll execute shell commands to create and populate it and then run queries as you request.\n\n4) Run a diagnostic now: e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; or SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;. Tell me which diagnostic query you want. I will explain why and then produce exactly one Action: Operation SQL statement for you to execute (or run it here if you tell me to execute it locally).\n\nIf you want me to run SQL directly from this shell as root instead of you executing the Action: Operation, say so and provide the SQL/diagnostic and I will run mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\" and return the raw output.\n\nReply with which option you choose and any required details. I will not run further commands until you instruct me.",
