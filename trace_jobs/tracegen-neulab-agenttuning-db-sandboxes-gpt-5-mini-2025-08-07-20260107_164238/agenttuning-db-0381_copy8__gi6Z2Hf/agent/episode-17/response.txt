  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running MySQL server (mysqld), confirmed by mysql --version and mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'. No SQL queries have been executed yet and there are no known databases/tables inspected because you have not provided a SQL question or requested any diagnostics. We can connect locally as root via the socket (mysql -u root) or run single statements from the shell with mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\".",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what to do next. Pick one of the options below and provide any required details; I will then follow your rule (explain my approach and then provide exactly one SQL statement in 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute):\n\n1) Provide your SQL question (and target database name if applicable). Example: \"Find the top 5 customers by total_orders in database shop_db.\" I will explain the SQL I will run and then output a single-line SQL statement in the required format.\n\n2) Ask for a diagnostic inspection now. Examples you can request: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table; DESCRIBE your_db.your_table; If you choose this, tell me which diagnostic and (if needed) the database name.\n\n3) Ask me to perform local server setup tasks (create a database/user, import a dump). If you want this, specify database name, user, and password (or say use defaults). I will explain the steps and then either run shell commands here if you permit or provide the single SQL needed.\n\nIf you want me to run SQL directly from this shell as root, confirm and provide the SQL question or diagnostic; I can run mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\" and return the raw output. Otherwise, when you request an Operation I will explain my reasoning and then output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled 'Action: Operation' for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.",
