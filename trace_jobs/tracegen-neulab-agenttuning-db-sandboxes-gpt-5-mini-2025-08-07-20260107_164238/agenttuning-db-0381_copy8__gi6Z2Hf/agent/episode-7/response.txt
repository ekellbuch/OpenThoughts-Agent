  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql --version confirmed) but there is no running MySQL server and no local database files or configs were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a SQL question or any MySQL server connection details (host, port, user, password, database). At this point I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either provide connection details for an existing server or ask me to install and initialize a local mysqld instance here.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do next: (A) Provide the SQL question plus connection details for a reachable MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute. (B) Permit me to install and start a local MySQL server in this container; if you choose this I will install mysqld, initialize it, start it, and create a database/user so you can provide the SQL to run. (C) Provide a database dump or sample output for local import and analysis. Once you choose, I'll either (1) craft and present the single-line SQL to execute, or (2) run the installation/initialization commands and then proceed. Please state your choice and any needed connection details or the SQL question.",
