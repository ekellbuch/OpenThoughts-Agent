  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server (mysqld). I installed the client and server, started the service, and verified it with mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'. I ran SHOW DATABASES; and the instance currently contains only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases or application data exist, and no user-provided SQL question or connection details for an external server have been given. Therefore there is nothing left to query until you either provide a question, provide/permit data, or ask for a diagnostic or setup action.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want me to do next. After you choose, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then (if you ask for an Operation) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format.\n\nOptions (choose one):\n1) Provide your SQL question (and target database name if applicable). I will explain my approach and then give one Action: Operation SQL statement for you to execute (or run it here if you prefer).\n2) Have me create a local test database and populate sample tables (specify DB name and schema or say 'simple sample schema'). I will then run queries you request.\n3) Provide a SQL dump or data to import; I will import it into a new local database and then run queries you request.\n4) Run a diagnostic inspection now (examples: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; DESCRIBE mysql.user;). Tell me which diagnostic; I will explain and then give one Action: Operation SQL statement for you to execute (or run it locally if you want me to).\n5) Connect to an external MySQL server you control: provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the query you want run; I will explain and provide the single-line SQL in Action: Operation format or run it via the client here using the supplied credentials.\n\nIf you want me to act directly in this shell (create DB/import/run SQL) rather than supplying the Action: Operation for you to execute, say so and provide any needed details. I will not run further commands until you tell me which option you choose.",
