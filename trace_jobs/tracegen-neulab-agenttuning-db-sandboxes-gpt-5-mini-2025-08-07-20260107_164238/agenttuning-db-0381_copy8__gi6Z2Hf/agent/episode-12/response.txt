  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container (ps shows mysqld and mysqladmin -u root ping returned 'mysqld is alive'). The MySQL client is available (mysql --version). No SQL queries have been executed yet and you have not provided a question or what data you want retrieved/modified. We can connect locally as root (socket) without a password using mysql -u root, and we can run SQL from the shell with mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\". At this point I need either the SQL question you want answered, or confirmation that you want me to run an initial diagnostic query (for example SHOW DATABASES;) so we can inspect the running server before proceeding.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do next:\n\n1) Provide your SQL question (and any constraints) and I will explain my approach and then produce an 'Action: Operation' containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will interpret it and continue (or give the final answer).\n\n2) Ask me to run a diagnostic inspection now (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;). If you confirm which diagnostic you want, I will both explain my reasoning and then produce the single-line SQL operation in the required 'Action: Operation' format.\n\n3) Ask me to create a database/user or to run other server-side setup. If you choose this, specify desired DB/user names and I will run the necessary shell commands and/or give the single SQL statement (as required) to perform the change.\n\nI will not execute any SQL until you either provide the question or confirm a diagnostic action. Once you confirm, I will (a) explain the SQL I will run, and then (b) present exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled with 'Action: Operation' per your rules.",
