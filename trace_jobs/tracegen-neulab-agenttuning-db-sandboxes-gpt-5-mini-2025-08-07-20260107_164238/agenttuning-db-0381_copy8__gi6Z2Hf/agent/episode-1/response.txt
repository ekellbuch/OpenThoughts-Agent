  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, and no local MySQL data/config files (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf do not exist). Also /root/.my.cnf is absent. That means we cannot run SQL yet from this environment. To be able to execute SQL statements when you provide them, we need to install a MySQL/MariaDB client so we can connect to a server (local or remote).",
  "plan": "1) Detect available package manager (apt-get or yum). 2) If apt-get is available, update package lists and install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client). 3) Verify installation by running mysql --version. After the client is available, I'll wait for your SQL question or connection details (host, user, password, database) and then produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for execution. Commands below perform the install and verification.",
