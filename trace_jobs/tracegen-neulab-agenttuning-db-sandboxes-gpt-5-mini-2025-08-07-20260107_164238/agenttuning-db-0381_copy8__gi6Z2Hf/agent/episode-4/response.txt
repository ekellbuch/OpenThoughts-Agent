No SQL has been executed because you haven't provided a question or any MySQL server connection details (host/port/user/password/database). To proceed I need either: (A) the SQL question you want answered plus connection details for a MySQL server I can reach from this container, or (B) permission to install and start a local mysqld instance here (which requires additional steps and configuration).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and then act accordingly:\n1) Provide the SQL question plus MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my approach and then produce a single-line SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute. OR\n2) Ask me to set up a local MySQL server here; if you choose that I will install and initialize a server, create a test database/user as needed, and then run the SQL you request. OR\n3) Provide a dump or sample of the database output you want me to analyze locally; I can then craft the SQL operations needed.\nWhen you provide the question and connection info (or choose local setup), I will: explain my reasoning, then output exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block labeled as 'Action: Operation' per your rules. After you run it and return the result, I'll continue until we reach a final answer and then output 'Action: Answer'.",
