  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client in the container (mysql --version now available). Previously there was no mysql client and no local mysqld/data/config files. At this point we have a client but no MySQL server connection details and no SQL has been executed. To run SQL we need either: (A) connection details for a remote/local MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) so the client can connect, or (B) a running local mysqld instance (not present).",
  "plan": "I will wait for your question or for connection details. When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my approach and thoughts. 2) Choose to either 'Operation' (send a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block as required) or 'Answer' if the task is complete. If we need to connect to a database first, provide host, port, user, password, and database name (or a .my.cnf) so I can craft the mysql client command and the single SQL to execute. If you want me to try connecting to a local server, tell me and I will attempt to start or inspect one. For now I will not run further commands until you supply the SQL question or connection info.",
