  "analysis": "The MySQL server is installed and running in the container and I successfully ran SHOW DATABASES; which returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or application data present, so no question about user data can be answered yet without importing or creating data or connecting to an external server. The environment is ready to run SQL (local root socket access), but I need your instruction about what to do next.",
  "plan": "Choose one of the following and tell me which you prefer (I will follow your rule: explain then provide exactly one SQL statement in an Action: Operation block when you ask me to run SQL). Options:\n\n1) Provide your SQL question that targets an existing database on a remote server: Give connection details (host, port, username, password, database) and the exact question. I will explain the SQL I will run and then supply the single-line SQL Operation for you to execute against that server.\n\n2) Import a database/dump you provide: Paste or upload the SQL dump (or tell me a file path) and I will import it into a newly created local database, then run the queries you request. If you want me to import now, tell me the dump content or file path.\n\n3) Create a new local test database and sample tables here: specify the database name and what sample tables/columns/rows you want (or say 'create simple sample schema'), and I will create them. After creation I will run any query you request. If you want me to create the sample DB now, confirm and I will run the necessary shell commands.\n\n4) Run a diagnostic query on the server now (examples: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;). Tell me which diagnostic SQL you want and I will explain and then provide exactly one Action: Operation SQL statement for you to execute (or run it locally if you prefer I execute it here).\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required details. If you want me to act directly in this shell (create DB/import/run SQL), say so and specify details and I will run the commands. Otherwise, if you want me to produce an Action: Operation SQL statement for you to run, specify the exact query goal and target database.",
