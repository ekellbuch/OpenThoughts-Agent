  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in this container (mysqld process present and mysqladmin -u root ping returned 'mysqld is alive'). The mysql client is available. No SQL queries have been executed yet because you haven't provided a SQL question or requested a diagnostic query. We can connect locally as root (socket) without a password using mysql -u root or run single statements via mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\". At this point I need you to either give the SQL question to answer or confirm a diagnostic action (for example SHOW DATABASES;).",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the options below and I will proceed exactly per your rules:\n\nOption A — You provide the SQL question: tell me the question and (if applicable) the target database name. I will explain my approach and then output exactly one 'Action: Operation' containing a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute; you'll paste back the raw MySQL output and I'll continue.\n\nOption B — Run a diagnostic now: if you want me to inspect the server, specify which diagnostic (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table;). I will explain the intent, then produce exactly one 'Action: Operation' with the single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Let me run SQL here as root: if you prefer that I execute SQL directly from this shell, confirm and specify the SQL (or request a diagnostic). I will then run mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\" here and return the raw output.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details. Once you choose, I will either (1) produce the single-line SQL in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to run, or (2) run the SQL locally in this shell if you prefer that.",
