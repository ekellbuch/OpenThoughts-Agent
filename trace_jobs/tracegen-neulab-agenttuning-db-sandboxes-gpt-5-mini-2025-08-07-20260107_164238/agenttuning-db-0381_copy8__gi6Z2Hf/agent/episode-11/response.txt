  "analysis": "The MySQL server is now installed and running in the container. mysql client is available (mysql --version earlier). The mysqld process is active (ps shows mysqld and mysqld_safe) and mysqladmin -u root ping returned 'mysqld is alive', so we can connect locally. No SQL queries have been executed against the server yet. By default on this Ubuntu install, the root user can connect via the Unix socket without a password (i.e., mysql -u root). I have not created any extra databases or users beyond the package defaults.",
  "plan": "Wait for your SQL question or instructions. When you provide the question, I will: 1) Explain my approach and reasoning for the SQL to run. 2) Choose 'Action: Operation' and present exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret it and continue with further single-statement operations or give the final answer ('Action: Answer') when certain. If you want me to run any preparatory commands (e.g., create a database or user, or run an initial inspection query such as SHOW DATABASES;), tell me and I will either (A) run shell commands to perform setup here (and list them below) or (B) directly provide the one-line SQL to execute via your MySQL client. To run SQL from this shell as root you can use: mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\". If you want me to proactively run a diagnostic SQL now (for example, SHOW DATABASES;), confirm and I will produce the required single-line SQL operation in the format you specified.",
