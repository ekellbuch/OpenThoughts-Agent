Choose one of the options below and I will proceed exactly as required by your rules (I will first explain the SQL I will run, then provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled 'Action: Operation'):\n\nOption 1 — Provide a SQL question: Give the exact question (and the target database name if applicable). I will explain my approach and then output one SQL statement for you to execute.\n\nOption 2 — Run a diagnostic inspection now: If you want to inspect the server, tell me which diagnostic (examples: SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; or SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table;). I will explain the intent and then present the single SQL statement to run.\n\nOption 3 — Create a database/user or perform setup: Specify the database name and user credentials (or tell me to use defaults). I will explain the actions and then present the single SQL statement to perform the requested change (or run the necessary shell commands if you ask me to perform setup directly in this shell).\n\nWhen you choose Option 2 or give a SQL question (Option 1), I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format. If you want me to run any shell commands here (for example to import data or create a user from the shell), confirm and specify details and I will provide the shell commands to execute.",
