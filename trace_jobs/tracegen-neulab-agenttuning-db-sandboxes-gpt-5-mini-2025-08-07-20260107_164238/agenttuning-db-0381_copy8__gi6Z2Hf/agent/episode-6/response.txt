No SQL statements have been executed because you haven't provided a SQL question or any MySQL server connection details (host, port, user, password, database). With the current state we cannot run SQL against a database until you either provide connection details for an existing server or ask me to install and initialize a local mysqld instance in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and then proceed:\n\n1) Provide the SQL question you want answered plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and return the raw MySQL output; I'll interpret it and continue until I can produce the final answer with 'Action: Answer'.\n\n2) Ask me to set up a local MySQL server here. If you choose that, I will: install a server (mysqld), initialize a database, start the server, create a user/database as needed, then run the SQL you request. If you want this, confirm and I will run the necessary commands.\n\n3) Provide a database dump or sample output you want analyzed locally; I can then craft SQL operations against that data after importing it.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide any required connection details or the SQL question. I will then proceed with the appropriate single SQL operation (or with server setup commands if you request a local server).",
