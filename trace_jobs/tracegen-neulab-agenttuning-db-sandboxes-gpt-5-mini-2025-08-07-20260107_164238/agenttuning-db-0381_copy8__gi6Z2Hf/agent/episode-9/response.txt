  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql --version confirmed). There is no MySQL server running here and previous checks showed no local MySQL data or config files (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, /root/.my.cnf were absent). No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a SQL question or any MySQL server connection details (host, port, user, password, database). To run SQL we need either connection details for an existing server reachable from this container, or permission to install and initialize a local mysqld instance here so queries can be executed locally.",
  "plan": "Tell me which option you want to proceed with and I will carry out the appropriate commands:\n\nOption A — Use an existing MySQL server you control:\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate no password), and database name (or indicate none).\n- Once you provide those, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (one-line SQL in a single SQL code block). You will run that in your MySQL client and paste the raw output back; I will interpret and continue until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Set up a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm that you want me to install and initialize a local server. If you confirm, I will run these commands:\n  1) apt-get update (already done) and apt-get install -y mysql-server to install the server.\n  2) Initialize the data directory if needed (mysqld --initialize-insecure) or use the package's default initialization.\n  3) Start the server (service mysql start or run mysqld_safe &).\n  4) Create a database and user (or use defaults) so you can run queries.\n- After the server is up I will request the SQL question, explain my approach, and then provide exactly one SQL statement as 'Action: Operation' for you to execute. After you return the raw output, I'll continue.\n\nOption C — Provide a database dump or sample data:\n- If you give a dump file or pasted table contents and the question, I can import it locally (after confirming you want me to create a local server or import into a temporary environment) and then run queries.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide any required connection details or confirm that I should install a local MySQL server. I will not run server-install commands until you confirm Option B.",
