  "analysis": "We're at a root shell in /app inside a container. No MySQL commands have been run yet and no question from the user is present. We don't know whether a MySQL server is running in this container, what client tools or credentials exist, or where database files/configs are located. To proceed we need to detect the presence of a MySQL client, any running mysqld processes, and any local configuration or data files that might contain credentials. Once we locate a usable client and credentials (or confirm none), we can run the user-provided SQL when they give the question.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether a MySQL client is available (mysql --version). 2) Check for a running MySQL server process (ps aux | grep -i mysqld). 3) Inspect common local data directory /var/lib/mysql to see if database files exist. 4) Look for common MySQL client credentials/config files: /etc/mysql/debian.cnf and /root/.my.cnf. These steps will tell us whether we can connect locally and where credentials may be found so we can run the user's SQL when provided.",
