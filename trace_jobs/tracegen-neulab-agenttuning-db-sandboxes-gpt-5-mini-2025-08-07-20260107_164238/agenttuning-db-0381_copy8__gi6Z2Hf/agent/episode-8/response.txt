  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql --version confirmed) but there is no MySQL server running here and no local database files or configuration were found earlier. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a SQL question or any MySQL server connection details (host, port, user, password, database). With the current state I cannot execute SQL against a database until you either (A) give connection details for an existing MySQL server accessible from this container, or (B) allow me to install and initialize a local mysqld server here so we can run queries locally.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want me to do next and provide any required details:\n\nOption A — Use a remote/external MySQL server you control:\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate no password), and target database name (or indicate none).\n- Once you provide those, I will explain the SQL I plan to run, then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation) as a single-line SQL code block. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret it and proceed until I can produce the final answer (Action: Answer).\n\nOption B — Set up a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize mysqld here. If you confirm, I will run commands to install the server (apt-get install mysql-server), initialize/start the service, create a database and user if you specify names/credentials (or I will create defaults), and then run the SQL you ask for.\n- Note: installing and starting a local server will take multiple commands and time; I will describe each command before running and then run them if you permit.\n\nOption C — Provide a dump or sample data for import:\n- Provide an SQL dump file or paste table contents and the question. I can import it locally (if you allow) and run queries against it.\n\nImportant: when you want me to execute SQL, I will follow your rule exactly: I will first explain my reasoning, then produce one Action: Operation with a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (and no other SQL). After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will continue.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required connection details or confirmation to proceed. If you choose Option B (local server), confirm and I will run the necessary setup commands.",
