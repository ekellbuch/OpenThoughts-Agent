  "analysis": "You have a working MySQL client and a running local MySQL server in the container (mysqld process present and mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'). I ran SHOW DATABASES; and only the default system databases exist: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or application data are present, and no SQL question or external connection details have been provided. The environment is ready to run SQL locally as root (mysql -u root) or to connect to an external server if you give credentials.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what to do next. Pick one of these options and provide any required details; I will then explain my approach and (if you ask me to run SQL) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute, or I can execute SQL directly here if you permit.\n\nOptions:\n1) Provide the SQL question you want answered (and the target database name if applicable). I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then output one 'Action: Operation' single-line SQL statement for you to execute.\n2) Ask me to run a diagnostic now (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table>;). Tell me which diagnostic and I will explain and then give one 'Action: Operation' SQL statement for you to run (or run it here if you prefer).\n3) Ask me to create a local test database and sample data here. Specify DB name and schema (or say 'simple sample schema'), and I will create/populate it and then we can run queries.\n4) Provide a SQL dump or data to import; I can import it into a new local database and then run queries you request.\n5) Provide connection details for an external MySQL server (host, port, username, password, database) and the question; I will explain the SQL and either produce the single-line SQL for you to run against that server or run it from this shell using the provided credentials.\n\nReply with which option you choose and any necessary details. I will then proceed, first explaining the SQL I will run and then providing exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (or executing it here if you ask me to).",
