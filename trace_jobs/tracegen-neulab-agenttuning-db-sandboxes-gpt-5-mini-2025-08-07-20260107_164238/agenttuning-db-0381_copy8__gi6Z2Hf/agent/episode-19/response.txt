  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container (mysqld process present and mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'). No SQL statements have been executed against the server yet in this session. There are no additional databases/tables known because you haven't requested any diagnostics or provided a SQL question. We can connect locally as root via the Unix socket (mysql -u root) or run single statements from the shell with mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\". At this point I cannot produce a useful SQL Operation because you haven't supplied the SQL question or specified which diagnostic/action you want performed.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want me to do next and provide any required details; I will then follow your rule (first explain the approach, then output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled 'Action: Operation'):\n\nOption 1 — You provide the SQL question: send the exact question and, if applicable, the database name. I will explain the intended SQL and then output one Action: Operation containing the single-line SQL statement for you to execute. After you paste back the raw MySQL output I will interpret it and continue or provide the final answer (Action: Answer).\n\nOption 2 — Run a diagnostic now: request a diagnostic SQL to inspect the server (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table>; DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;). Tell me which diagnostic and, if needed, the database name. I will explain why I chose that diagnostic and then present exactly one Action: Operation with the one-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\nOption 3 — Create a database/user or import data: specify DB name, user, and password (or say use defaults), or provide a dump to import. If you want me to perform local setup, confirm and provide details; I will explain the steps and then either run shell commands here (if you permit) or produce the single SQL statement required.\n\nIf you want me to run SQL directly from this shell as root instead of you executing the Action: Operation, say so and provide the SQL/diagnostic. I will then run mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\" and return the raw output. Otherwise, pick one of the three options above and I will proceed by (a) explaining the SQL and then (b) outputting exactly one SQL statement in the required format.",
