I will then explain my approach and produce a single SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute.\n- Ask me to create a new test database and sample tables here (specify names and columns or ask me to create a simple example). If you choose this I will run the shell commands to create the database/tables and populate sample rows, then we can run queries against them.\n- Provide a SQL dump or data to import; I can import it into a new database and then run queries.\n\nIf you want me to proceed with any of the above, state which option and give the necessary details. I will then explain the SQL I plan to run and present exactly one SQL statement in the 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute (or I will run the required shell commands if you ask me to act directly in the container).",
