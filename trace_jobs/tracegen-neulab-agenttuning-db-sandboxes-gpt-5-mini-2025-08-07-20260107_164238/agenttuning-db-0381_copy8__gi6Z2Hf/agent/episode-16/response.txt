No SQL queries have been executed yet and there are no additional databases or tables known because you haven't requested any inspection. I can connect locally as root via the Unix socket (mysql -u root) or run single statements from the shell with mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\". At this point I need a specific SQL question or instruction from you to proceed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify what you want. Please choose one of the following and provide any required details:\n\n1) Provide the SQL question you want answered (and the target database name if applicable). I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one 'Action: Operation' containing a single-line SQL statement in a single SQL code block as you required. You will execute that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will interpret the output and continue (or produce 'Action: Answer' when certain).\n\n2) Ask for a diagnostic inspection now (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table;). Tell me which diagnostic you want and I will explain the intent and then provide exactly one 'Action: Operation' with the single-line SQL statement for you to run.\n\n3) Ask me to perform local server setup tasks (create a database/user or import a dump). If you choose this, specify names/credentials or provide the dump; I will explain the steps and then either run shell commands here (if you permit) or give the single SQL statement required.\n\nWhen you pick an option, I will first explain the SQL I plan to run, then present exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL code block).",
