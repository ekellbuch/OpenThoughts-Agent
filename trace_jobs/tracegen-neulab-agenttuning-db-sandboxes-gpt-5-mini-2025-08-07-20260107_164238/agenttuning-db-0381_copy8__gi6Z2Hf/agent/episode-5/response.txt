  "analysis": "You haven't provided a SQL question or any MySQL server connection details yet. The container has a MySQL client installed, but no local server is running and there are no local database files. That means I cannot run any SQL until you either (A) give connection details for a reachable MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) ask me to install and initialize a local mysqld instance in this container. No SQL has been executed so far.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following actions and then proceed:\n\n1) Provide the SQL question you want answered plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Once you provide those, I will: explain my approach and reasoning, then produce a single SQL statement in the exact 'Action: Operation' format you requested (SQL in a single-line code block). You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret it and either run another single SQL operation or produce the final answer with 'Action: Answer'.\n\n2) Ask me to set up a local MySQL server here. If you choose that, I'll install and initialize mysqld, create a database/user as needed, then run your SQL. This requires additional commands and time.\n\n3) Provide a database dump or sample output you want me to analyze locally; I can then craft relevant SQL operations.\n\nWhen you supply the question and connection method, I'll give a clear explanation of the SQL I plan to run and then return exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.",
