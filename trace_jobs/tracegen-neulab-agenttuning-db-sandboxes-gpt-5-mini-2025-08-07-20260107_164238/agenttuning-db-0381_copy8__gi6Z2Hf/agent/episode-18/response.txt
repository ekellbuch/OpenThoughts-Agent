I previously installed the client and server, started the service, and verified it with mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'. No SQL queries have been executed against the server yet, and you have not provided any SQL question or requested a diagnostic query. To proceed I need either the exact SQL question you want answered or explicit permission to run a diagnostic or setup action on the local server.",
  "plan": "Tell me which action you want next (pick one):\n\n1) Provide the SQL question you want answered (and the target database name if applicable). I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL code block). You will execute it and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret and continue or produce the final answer with 'Action: Answer'.\n\n2) Ask for a diagnostic now (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM your_db; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;). I will explain the intent and then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute.\n\n3) Permit me to perform local server setup tasks (create a database/user or import a dump). If you choose this, specify database/user names and credentials; I will explain and then either run the shell commands here (if you want me to act directly) or provide the single SQL statement required.\n\nOnce you choose, I will follow your rule: explain my approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled 'Action: Operation'.",
