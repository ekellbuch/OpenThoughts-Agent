  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client and a running MySQL server (mysqld). I installed the client and server, started the service, and verified it with mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'. No SQL has been executed yet because you have not provided a SQL question or requested any diagnostic or setup action. There are currently no inspected databases/tables to report because no diagnostic SQL was run. I can run SQL locally as root via the socket (mysql -u root) or run single statements from the shell with mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\".",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me which action to take next. Choose one of the options below and provide any needed details; after you choose I will (1) explain my intended SQL, then (2) produce exactly one 'Action: Operation' containing a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block as you required, which you will execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nOptions:\n- Option A (provide a question): Give the exact SQL question you want answered and the target database name if applicable. I will explain the SQL I will run and then present one SQL statement for you to execute.\n- Option B (diagnostic): Ask me to run a diagnostic inspection now (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <db>.<table>; DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;). Specify which diagnostic and database if needed. I will explain the intent and then present the single SQL statement for you to run.\n- Option C (local setup): Ask me to perform server-side setup (create a database/user or import a dump). Specify database/user names and credentials or provide the dump. I will explain the steps and then either run the shell commands here (if you permit) or provide the single SQL statement required.\n\nIf you want me to execute SQL directly from this shell instead of you running the Action: Operation, say so and provide the SQL/diagnostic and I will run mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\" and return the raw output.",
