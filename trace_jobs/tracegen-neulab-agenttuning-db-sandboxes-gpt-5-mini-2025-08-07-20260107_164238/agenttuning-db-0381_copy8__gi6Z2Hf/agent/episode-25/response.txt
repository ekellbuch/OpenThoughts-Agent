  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container (mysqld process present and mysqladmin -u root ping => 'mysqld is alive'). I ran SHOW DATABASES; and only the default system databases exist (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user databases or data to query yet. The environment is ready to run SQL locally as root via the socket (mysql -u root) or to connect to a remote server if you provide credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the options below and I will proceed exactly as required (I will first explain the SQL I will run, then provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled 'Action: Operation', which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output):\n\nOption A — Provide the SQL question you want answered (and, if it targets a remote server, provide connection details: host, port, username, password, database). I will explain my approach and then produce the single SQL statement for you to run.\n\nOption B — Have me create a local test database and sample data here so you can run queries. If you choose this, specify a database name and an outline of tables/columns (or say 'create simple sample schema'); I will then (if you confirm) run the shell commands to create/populate it and report back.\n\nOption C — Provide a SQL dump or data to import. If you supply the dump (or a file path), I can import it into a new local database and then run queries you request.\n\nOption D — Run a diagnostic inspection (examples: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user; DESCRIBE mysql.user;). Specify which diagnostic and I will explain and then provide exactly one Action: Operation SQL statement for you to execute.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also execute SQL directly from this shell as root (using mysql -u root -e \"<SQL>\")—tell me which SQL or diagnostic to run and I will run it and return the raw output. Please tell me which option you choose and provide any required details.",
