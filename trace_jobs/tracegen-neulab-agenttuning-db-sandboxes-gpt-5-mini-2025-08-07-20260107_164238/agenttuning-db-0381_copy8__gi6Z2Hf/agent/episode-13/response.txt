No SQL queries have been executed against the server from this session because you haven't provided a specific SQL question or requested a diagnostic query yet.

  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose what to do next. Pick one of the options below and provide any required details, and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — Provide your SQL question: give the exact question (and target database if applicable). I will explain my approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will interpret it and continue until we reach the final answer (Action: Answer).\n\nOption B — Run a diagnostic now: ask me to run a diagnostic SQL (for example SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;). If you choose this, I will explain the intent and then provide exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Create a database/user or perform server-side setup: specify names/credentials and I will create them (I will explain and then either run shell commands here or provide the single SQL statement as required).\n\nImportant: I will not run any SQL until you either provide the question or confirm a diagnostic action. When you choose, I will follow your rule: first explain the SQL, then present exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block labeled with 'Action: Operation'.",
