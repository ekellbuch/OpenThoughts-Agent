  "analysis": "The MySQL client is now installed in the container (mysql --version reports 8.0.44). There is still no running local MySQL server and no database files were found earlier. At this point we can run SQL only if you provide connection details for a MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or if you ask us to start/configure a local server. No SQL has been executed yet and no question from you has been provided.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your question and/or database connection details. When you supply them I will: 1) Explain my approach and reasoning. 2) If needed, construct a mysql client command to connect (using the provided host/port/user/password/database). 3) Choose 'Action: Operation' and provide exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (one line) as required. After you execute that SQL and provide the output, I'll interpret the results and either run a further single SQL operation or provide the final answer with 'Action: Answer' when certain.",
