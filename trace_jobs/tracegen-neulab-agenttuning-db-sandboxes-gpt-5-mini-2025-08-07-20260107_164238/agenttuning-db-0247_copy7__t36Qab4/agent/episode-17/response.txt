  "analysis": "You're at a shell prompt in /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (attempting to connect to the default socket returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. No database schema, tables, or a specific question have been provided. Because of this, I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three paths. For each path I list what I need and what I'll do next:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - You provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf on the container with [client] credentials and tell me).\n  - Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired output).\n  - Once provided I will explain the query approach and then (per your protocol) produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL statement in a single-line code block). You will run it and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and iterate.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n  - If confirmed I will install and start the server, initialize it, and (if you request) create databases/tables or load data. After the server is running I will run queries; I will show the commands I will execute beforehand.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables and columns) and the question.\n  - I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the requested details (connection credentials or confirm server install, or schema + question). Also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
