  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt in /app inside the container. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (previous attempt to connect returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection details. Because of that I cannot run any SQL against a database right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three clear options so I can proceed. For each option I list what I need and what I will do next:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in this container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired output).\n- After you provide credentials and the question I will: test the connection with the mysql client, explain the SQL approach, and then (per your protocol) output exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL code block for you to execute. You will run it and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install & start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install a server and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n- If confirmed I will run: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server); start the service; optionally set root password or create databases/tables you request. Once the server is running I will run queries under your one-statement-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables/columns) and the question.\n- I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and supply the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only to produce SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm the next step.",
