  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (connecting to the default socket failed), and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables or /root/.my.cnf credentials present. No database question, schema, or connection details have been provided by you yet. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. You can pick one of these options:\n\n1) Query an existing MySQL server (recommended): provide connection details (host or IP, port if not 3306, username, and password) and the exact database question (which database/table/columns and what you want). Optionally place credentials in /root/.my.cnf on the container and tell me. Once you provide details and the question, I will explain the approach and then (per the protocol) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\n2) Start a local server in this container: confirm whether you want MariaDB or MySQL. If you confirm, I will install and start the server here, initialize it, and then create or load data as you request. After the server runs I can issue SQL statements under your protocol.\n\n3) Only want SQL text (no execution): provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary information (connection credentials, confirm server install, or schema + question). I will not run any commands until you confirm the next step.",
