  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt in /app inside a container. The mysql client has been installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (connecting to the default socket returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf found to provide credentials. No database schema, tables, or a specific question have been provided by you. Therefore I cannot run any SQL or produce results until I have either connection details to an existing database or permission to install and start a local server and (optionally) load schema/data.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options and provide the required information. After you choose, I will execute a precise sequence of commands or produce the single SQL statement per your protocol. Options and the next commands I will run for each:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- What I need from you: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf with [client] credentials in this container and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired result).\n- Once provided, I will: (a) test connection using the mysql client; (b) run one SQL statement at a time per your protocol. Example commands I will run when you give credentials: \"mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u<user> -p'<password>' -e \\\"SHOW DATABASES;\\\"\\n\" (you will see the single-statement SQL returned). If password contains special characters I will quote/escape appropriately.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB and confirm you want me to proceed.\n- If confirmed, I will run commands to install and start a server and then initialize/create schema as you request. Example commands: \"apt-get update\\n\", \"apt-get install -y mariadb-server\\n\", then start and secure the server and create DB/tables as you specify. After the server is running I will run queries locally using the mysql client.\n\nOption 3 — Provide SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question you want answered.\n- I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to run on your server. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials or confirm server install, or schema + question). Indicate whether you want me to operate (I will output Action: Operation with one SQL statement) or only to produce SQL text. I will not run any further commands until you confirm.",
