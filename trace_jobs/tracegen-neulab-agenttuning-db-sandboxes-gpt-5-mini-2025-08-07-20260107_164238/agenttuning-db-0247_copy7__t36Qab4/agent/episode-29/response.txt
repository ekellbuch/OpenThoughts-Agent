  "analysis": "Container state: mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (attempt to connect to the default socket failed with ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf providing credentials. The working directory /app is empty. You have not provided a database question, schema, or connection details for any remote server, so I cannot run any SQL or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction which of these three options you want to follow. For each option I list what I need and the exact commands I will run if you confirm:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- What I need from you: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf with [client] credentials in the container and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired result).\n- Commands I will run once credentials + question are provided (example test):\n  1) mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u<user> -p'<password>' -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n  (Then I will craft a single SQL statement per your protocol and present it as Action: Operation in a single-line SQL code block.)\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Tell me whether you prefer MariaDB or MySQL and confirm you want me to install and start a server here. After confirmation I will run (example for MariaDB):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n  3) service mysql start\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- After the server is running I can create databases/tables you request and then produce one SQL statement at a time per your protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach then output exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
