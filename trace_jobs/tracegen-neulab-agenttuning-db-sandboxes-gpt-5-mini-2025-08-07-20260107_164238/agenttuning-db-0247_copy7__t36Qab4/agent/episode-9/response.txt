  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally (attempts to connect to the default socket failed). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf to provide credentials. No database schema, tables, or specific question have been provided by you. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database right now because there is no reachable server and no connection details.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me which path you want to take. Choose one of the following options and provide the requested information so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the DB connection details: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf with [client] credentials inside the container and tell me). Also provide the exact question you want answered (which database/table/columns and the desired result). After you provide credentials and the question, I will explain the SQL approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run that single SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output; we will iterate until the final answer is ready.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and tell me whether you prefer MariaDB or MySQL. If confirmed, I will install and start the server, initialize it, optionally set a root password, and then create or load any schema/data you request. After the server is running I will follow your protocol to run one SQL statement per turn.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- If you only want me to write the SQL and not execute it, provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables and columns) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL block for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the needed details (connection credentials or schema + question, or confirm starting a local server). I will not run any commands until you confirm the next step.",
