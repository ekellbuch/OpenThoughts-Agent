  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally (mysql -uroot failed with ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf providing credentials. No database schema, tables, or specific question have been provided. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one of the options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or place credentials in /root/.my.cnf and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and what you want). After you provide credentials and the question, I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local server inside this container:\n- Confirm you want this and specify MySQL or MariaDB. If confirmed, I will install and start the server here, initialize it, and (if you request) create databases/tables or load data. Once the server is running I will proceed to run queries under your protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install, or schema + question). I will then proceed.",
