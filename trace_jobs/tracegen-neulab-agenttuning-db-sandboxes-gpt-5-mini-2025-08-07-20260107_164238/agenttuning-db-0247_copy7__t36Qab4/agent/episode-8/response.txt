  "analysis": "You are in a container with the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally (mysql -uroot failed with ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables or /root/.my.cnf credentials. No database question or schema has been provided by you yet, so I cannot construct or run any SQL. To proceed I need either connection details to an existing MySQL server you want me to query, or your permission to install and start a local database server in this container and (optionally) load schema/data.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these you want to do next. I will wait for your choice before running anything.\n\nOption A — Use an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf on the container and say so). Also provide the exact database question (which tables/columns and what you want). \n- After you provide credentials + question, I will explain the query approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back; we'll iterate until the answer is complete.\n\nOption B — Start a local server inside this container:\n- Confirm you want this. If so, I will install and start a server (I can use mariadb-server or mysql-server). Example commands I would run (only after you confirm):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server)\n  3) ensure the server is running (service mysql start or systemctl start mysql if available)\n  4) secure or set root password if you request it (mysql_secure_installation or SQL commands)\n- Once the server is running I can create databases/tables and run queries. After starting the server I will follow your instructions about schema/data and then produce one SQL statement at a time per the protocol.\n\nOption C — You only want SQL text (no execution here):\n- Provide the table schema (CREATE TABLE or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block for you to run wherever the database is hosted.\n\nIf you choose Option A, please paste connection details and the question. If you choose Option B, say which server you prefer (MariaDB or MySQL) and confirm installation. If you choose Option C, paste the schema and the question. I will then proceed and, when operating, output exactly one SQL statement per turn as required.",
