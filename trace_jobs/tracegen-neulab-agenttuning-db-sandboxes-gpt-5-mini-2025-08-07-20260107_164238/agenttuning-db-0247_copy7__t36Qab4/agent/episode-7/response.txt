  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (connection to /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock failed). No MYSQL_* environment variables or /root/.my.cnf exist to provide credentials. No database question or schema has been provided. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Use an existing MySQL server:\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which tables/columns and what you want). After you provide these, I will explain the query approach and then, per your protocol, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and start a MySQL/MariaDB server here. If confirmed, I will run the necessary apt-get install and start commands, initialize a database, and then run queries or create schema/data as you request.\n\nOption 3 — I only produce SQL (no execution):\n- Provide the schema (table definitions or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and produce a single-line SQL statement (in the required markdown SQL block) for you to run locally or on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required connection details or schema/question. I will not run further commands until you confirm.",
