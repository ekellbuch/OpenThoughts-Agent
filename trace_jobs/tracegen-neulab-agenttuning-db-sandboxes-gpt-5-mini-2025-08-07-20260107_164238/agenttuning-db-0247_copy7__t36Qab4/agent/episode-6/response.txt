  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (attempt to connect to the default socket failed), no MYSQL_* env vars and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. I cannot run any SQL until I have a reachable server (remote or local) and appropriate credentials, or until you ask me to install and start a server locally. You also have not provided the specific database question or schema to answer.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you tell me how you'd like to proceed. Please choose one of these options and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Use an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (if not 3306), username, password (or place credentials into /root/.my.cnf on the container). Also provide the exact database question and, if relevant, the database name and table names. After you provide credentials and the question I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation) for you to execute; you will paste back the raw MySQL output for me to analyze further.\n- If you prefer to supply credentials via file, create /root/.my.cnf with content like:\n  [client]\\n  user=youruser\\n  password=yourpassword\\n  host=yourhost\n  (ensure file permissions are 600). Then tell me and I will attempt connection.\n\nOption B — Start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this. I will install and start a MySQL/MariaDB server here, initialize it, and (if you want) create databases/tables or load data. This requires additional apt-get installs and service start commands.\n\nOption C — I only produce SQL (no execution):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables and columns) and the question. I will explain the approach and then provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line, in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run locally. If more queries are needed we'll iterate.\n\nNotes on protocol once you ask me to operate:\n- When I operate I will output:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  SELECT ...;\n  ```\n  (Exactly one SQL statement, single line inside the code block). You will execute that and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. We will repeat until the question is answered.\n- When I finish and am confident of the final answer I will output:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n  (Only when certain.)\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (credentials or schema + question).",
