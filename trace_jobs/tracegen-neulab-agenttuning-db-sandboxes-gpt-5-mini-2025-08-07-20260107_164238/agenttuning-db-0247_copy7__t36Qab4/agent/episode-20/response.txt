  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (previous attempt to connect produced ERROR 2002: can't connect to local MySQL server through socket). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf file with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection details. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options and provide the required details. After you choose, I will execute the corresponding commands (or produce the single SQL statement per your protocol):\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - You provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired output).\n  - I will: test the connection with the mysql client, explain the SQL approach, and then (per your protocol) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n  - Confirm whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB and confirm you want me to proceed.\n  - I will run: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server); start the service; optionally set root password and create any DB/schema you request. Once the server runs I will run queries under your one-statement-per-turn rule.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of the relevant tables/columns) and the question.\n  - I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or the schema and question). Also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
