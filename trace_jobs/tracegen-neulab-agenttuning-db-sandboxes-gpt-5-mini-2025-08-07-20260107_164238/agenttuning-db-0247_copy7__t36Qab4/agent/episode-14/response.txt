  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (attempt to connect to the default socket failed), no MYSQL_* environment variables, and no /root/.my.cnf present with credentials. You have not supplied a database question, schema, or connection details. Therefore I cannot run any SQL at this time.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do next and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\n1) Query an existing MySQL server (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired result). After you provide credentials and the question I will explain the approach and then (per your protocol) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\n2) Start a local server in this container: confirm you want me to install and start MariaDB or MySQL here. If you confirm, I will install and start the server, initialize it, and then create/load schema/data as you request. After the server is running I will run queries following your one-SQL-per-turn rule.\n\n3) I only produce SQL (no execution here): provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server.\n\nPlease choose option 1, 2, or 3 and supply the necessary details (connection credentials or confirm server install, or schema + question). Also tell me if you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only to produce SQL text.",
