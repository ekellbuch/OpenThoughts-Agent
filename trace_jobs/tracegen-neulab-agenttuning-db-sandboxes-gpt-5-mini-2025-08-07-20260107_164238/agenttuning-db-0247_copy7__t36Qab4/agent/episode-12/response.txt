  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (mysql -uroot failed with ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. No database schema, tables, or a specific question have been provided by you. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the options below and provide the requested information:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in this container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and what you want). After you provide credentials and the question, I will explain the approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm that you want me to install and start a local MySQL or MariaDB server here. If confirmed, I will run the necessary apt-get install and start commands, initialize the server, and (if you request) create databases/tables or load data. After the server is running I can run queries under your protocol.\n\nOption 3 — I only produce SQL (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block for you to run on your server.\n\nWhen you choose an option, also say whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only to explain and provide SQL text. If you choose Operation, I will follow your protocol and output one SQL statement per turn. If you choose to start a local server, confirm which server (MySQL or MariaDB).\n\nI will not run any further commands until you confirm which option and provide the necessary details.",
