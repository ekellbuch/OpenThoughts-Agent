  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt in /app inside the container. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (attempting to connect to the default socket previously returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or connection details for a remote server. Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL against a database right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear next steps and provide any required details. For each option I describe what I'll do and the exact commands I would run once you confirm:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - You provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf on the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired output).\n  - Once you provide credentials + question I will: test connection with the mysql client and then (per your protocol) produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation) for you to execute. Example commands I would run to test/connect (only after you supply details):\n    - mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u<user> -p'<password>' -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n  - After you run the single SQL I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze and continue with further single-statement operations as needed.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to proceed and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n  - If confirmed, I will run commands to install and start the server and then initialize/create any schema/data you request. Example commands I would run (after confirmation):\n    - apt-get update\n    - apt-get install -y mariadb-server\n    - service mysql start\n    - mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n  - Then I will create any schema/data you ask for and run queries under your one-SQL-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question.\n  - I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
