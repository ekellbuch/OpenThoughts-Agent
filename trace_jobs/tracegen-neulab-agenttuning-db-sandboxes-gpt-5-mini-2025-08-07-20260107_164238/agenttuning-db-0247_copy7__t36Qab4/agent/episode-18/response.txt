  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). No MySQL/MariaDB server is running locally (attempt to connect to the default socket previously returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials present. You have not given a database question, schema, or connection details for a remote server. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL or return database results at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one clear next step. Pick one of the options below and provide the requested details; I will then proceed and list the exact commands I will run.\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired output).\n  - After you provide credentials and the question I will: test the connection with the mysql client, explain the SQL approach, then (per your protocol) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nOption B — Install and start a local server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want a local server and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n  - If confirmed I will run (for example) these commands to install and start MariaDB: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server; service mysql start (or systemctl if available). I will then initialize/set root password if you request, create any DB/schema you want, and run queries under your one-SQL-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption C — I only produce SQL (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of the relevant tables/columns) and the question.\n  - I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
