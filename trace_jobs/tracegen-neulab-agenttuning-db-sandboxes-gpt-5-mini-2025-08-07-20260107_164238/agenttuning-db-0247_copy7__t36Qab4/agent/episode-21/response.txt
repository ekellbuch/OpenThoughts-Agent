  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (attempts to connect to the default socket returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection details. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL against a database right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in this container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired output). After you provide credentials and the question I will explain the approach and then (per your protocol) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install & start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm whether you want MariaDB or MySQL and confirm installation. If confirmed I will install and start the server, initialize it, and (if you request) create databases/tables or load data. Once the server is running I will run queries under your one-SQL-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Provide SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only provide SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
