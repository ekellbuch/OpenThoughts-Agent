  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (previous mysql -uroot produced ERROR 2002: can't connect to local socket). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. The working directory /app is empty. You have not provided a database question, schema, or connection details for any remote server, so I cannot run any SQL or return database results at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these three clear options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired output).\n  - Once provided I will: test the connection with the mysql client, explain the SQL approach, and then (per your protocol) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install a local database and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n  - If confirmed I will run apt-get update and install/start the server, initialize it, optionally set a root password, and then create/load any schema/data you request. After the server runs I will run queries under your one-statement-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables/columns) and the exact question.\n  - I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm the next step.",
