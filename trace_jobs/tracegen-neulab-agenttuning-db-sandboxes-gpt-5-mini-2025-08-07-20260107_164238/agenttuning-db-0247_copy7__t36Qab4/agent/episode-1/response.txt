  "analysis": "Currently I'm at a shell prompt in /app. There are no files in /app. The process list shows no MySQL/MariaDB server running in the container. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). To run SQL against a MySQL server I need a client. I haven't been asked a specific database question yet, and I also don't know if a remote MySQL server is available. The next step is to install a MySQL client so I can run SQL commands if a server is reachable, then check for availability of a MySQL server to connect to.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists (apt-get update) to be able to install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so the mysql CLI is available. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed (which mysql and mysql --version). 4) If installed, attempt a simple connection to localhost with no password to see if a local server exists (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"). If a server requires credentials or is remote, you'll need to provide connection details. These commands will prepare the environment to run SQL statements as you request.",
