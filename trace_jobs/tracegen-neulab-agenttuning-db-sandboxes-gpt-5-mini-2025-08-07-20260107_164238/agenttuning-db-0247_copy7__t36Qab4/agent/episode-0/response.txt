  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt (root@c0db34d45a24:/app#). No MySQL commands have been run yet and no database output is available. There is no provided question about the database content yet. Before issuing any SQL, I need to discover whether a MySQL client is installed and whether I can connect to a server from this container. The next steps are to inspect the current directory, check running processes, verify the presence of the mysql client, and attempt a simple connection (SHOW DATABASES) to see available databases and connection requirements (e.g., password).",
  "plan": "1) List files to see if any database files or scripts exist in /app. 2) Print working directory for context. 3) Check running processes to see if a MySQL server is running locally. 4) Check whether the mysql client is installed and its version. 5) Attempt to run a simple SQL statement (SHOW DATABASES;) using the mysql client as root with no password to determine connection status. Each command's purpose is to gather information so we can craft the correct SQL operations next.",
