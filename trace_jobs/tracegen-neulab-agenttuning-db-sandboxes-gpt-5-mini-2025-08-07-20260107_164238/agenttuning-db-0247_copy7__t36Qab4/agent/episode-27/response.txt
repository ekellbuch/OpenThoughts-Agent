  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (attempting to connect returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf file with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection details. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired output).\n  - After you provide credentials and the question I will explain the SQL approach and then (per your protocol) output exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install & start a local server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install a local database and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n  - If confirmed I will run the required apt-get install and start commands, initialize the server, and then create/load any schema/data you request. Once the server is running I will run queries under your one-statement-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n  - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question.\n  - I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
