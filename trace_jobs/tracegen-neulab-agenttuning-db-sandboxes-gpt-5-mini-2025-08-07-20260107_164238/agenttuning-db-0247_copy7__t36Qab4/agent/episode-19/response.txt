  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (previous mysql -uroot returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection details. As a result I cannot run any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options and provide the required details so I can proceed. After you reply I'll take the corresponding steps and, if you request an operation, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per your protocol.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Query an existing MySQL server: provide host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf on the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired output). After you provide credentials and the question, I will explain the approach and then output Action: Operation with a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to run.\n\n2) Install & start a local server in this container: confirm whether you want MariaDB or MySQL and confirm installation. If confirmed I will install, start and initialize the server and then create/load any schema/data you request; then I will run queries per the one-statement-per-turn protocol.\n\n3) Produce SQL only (no execution here): provide the table schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block for you to run on your server.\n\nPlease state which option you choose and give the necessary details (connection credentials or confirm server install, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text.",
