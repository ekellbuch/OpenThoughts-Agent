  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (previous mysql -uroot attempt returned ERROR 2002: can't connect to local socket). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf file with credentials. You have not provided any database question, schema, or remote connection details. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Provide one of the following options and the required details so I can continue:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired output). After you provide credentials and the question I will explain my approach and then (per your protocol) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install a local database and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. If confirmed I will run apt-get update and install/start the server, initialize it, and then create/load any schema/data you request. After the server runs I can run queries under your one-statement-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables/columns) and the exact question. I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL code block) for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
