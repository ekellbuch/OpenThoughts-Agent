  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt in /app inside the container. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (previous attempt to connect produced ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or connection details for a remote server. Because of that I cannot execute any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options and provide the required details so I can proceed. For each option I list what I need and what I will do next:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired output).\n- Once provided I will: test the connection with the mysql client (one command), explain the SQL approach, then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install a local database and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n- If confirmed I will run: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server); start the service; optionally set/root password or create DB/schema you request. After the server is running I will create/load any schema/data you want and then run queries under your one-SQL-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables/columns) and the exact question.\n- I will explain the approach and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown SQL block) for you to run on your server. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will continue.\n\nPlease reply which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection credentials, or confirm server install and which server, or schema + question). Also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only to supply SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm which path to take.",
