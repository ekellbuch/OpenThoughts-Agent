  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but no MySQL server is running locally (attempt to connect to /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock failed). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. I cannot run any SQL against a database until either: (A) you provide connection details for a reachable MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, user, password, and optionally database), or (B) you instruct me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container so I can create or load data and then run queries. You also have not yet provided the specific database question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and then proceed accordingly:\n\nOption 1 — Provide connection details and the question:\n- You give the DB host, port (if non-default), username, and password (or place credentials in ~/.my.cnf) and state the exact question (which table(s) and what you want to find). I will explain the approach, then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze and continue, repeating one SQL per turn as needed.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local server in this container:\n- If you confirm, I will install and start MariaDB or MySQL server here, initialize it, optionally create a database/schema, and then run queries. If you want this, confirm and I will run the necessary apt-get install and service start commands. After the server is running I will create or load data as you direct and then produce single-line SQL statements per your protocol.\n\nOption 3 — If you only want an explanation or SQL examples without executing anything, state the database schema (table definitions) and the question; I will explain the SQL and give the exact single-line SQL statement you would run, but I will not attempt to connect.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (credentials or schema and question), and I will proceed. I will not run any further commands until you confirm which path to take.",
