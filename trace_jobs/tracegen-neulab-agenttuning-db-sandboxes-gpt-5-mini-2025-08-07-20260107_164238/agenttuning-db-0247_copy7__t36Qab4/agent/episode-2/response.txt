  "analysis": "The mysql client is now installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). Previously attempted mysql -uroot failed with ERROR 2002 because there's no local MySQL server socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). The container currently has no MySQL server running. To proceed with executing SQL I'll need connection details (a running MySQL server: host, port, user, password, or an accessible socket). Before asking you for credentials or the question to answer, I should search the container for any existing client configuration or environment variables that might point to a database (e.g., ~/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql config, MYSQL_* env vars) and check whether any process is listening on port 3306.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect environment variables for any MYSQL-related settings (may indicate remote DB credentials or host). 2) Check root's home and any ~/.my.cnf for stored client credentials. 3) List /etc/mysql and inspect my.cnf and included configuration for socket/port/bind-address to see if a server was configured here. 4) Check listening TCP sockets for any listener on port 3306. Based on results, either (A) if connection info is found, attempt a mysql client connection using that info and then run the requested SQL; or (B) if no server info is found, ask you to provide the database question and connection details (host, port, user, password, or a SQL statement to run if you will run it).",
