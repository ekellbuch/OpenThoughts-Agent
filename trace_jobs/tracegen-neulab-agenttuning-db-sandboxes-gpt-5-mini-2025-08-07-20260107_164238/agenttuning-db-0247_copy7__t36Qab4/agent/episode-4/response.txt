  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (attempting to connect to the default socket failed). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables or a /root/.my.cnf providing credentials, and /etc/mysql contains only default configuration. At this point I cannot run any SQL because there is no reachable server and you haven't provided a database question or connection details.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me which of the following you want to do next:\n\n1) Provide the database question and connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, user, password, and optionally database). If you provide credentials I will attempt to connect and then (per your protocol) prepare a single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. Note: you can supply credentials directly here, or place them in a ~/.my.cnf on the container (safer). If you provide a password with special characters, escape or quote it. After connecting I'll run one SQL statement per turn and you will paste back the raw MySQL output for me to analyze.\n\n2) Ask me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container. If you choose this, I will (with your confirmation) install a server package, initialize and start it, and then create or load any schema/data you request. Installing/starting a server requires additional commands and may take time.\n\nWhen you give the database question, also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or whether you just want an explanation/answer without running SQL. If you want me to operate, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line code block (Action: Operation) as required. If you want me to start a local server, confirm and I will proceed and provide the commands I will run.",
