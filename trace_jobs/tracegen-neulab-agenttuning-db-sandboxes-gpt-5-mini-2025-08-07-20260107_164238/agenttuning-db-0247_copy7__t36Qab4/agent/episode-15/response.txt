  "analysis": "The environment: mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (attempt to connect to /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock failed). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, a schema, or connection details for a remote server. Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Please choose one of the following and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and the desired result). After you provide credentials and the question, I will explain the approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block) for you to execute. You will paste the raw MySQL output back and I will continue.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and start a local MySQL or MariaDB server. If confirmed, I will install, start, and initialize the server and then create/load any schema/data you request. After that I can run queries per your one-SQL-per-turn protocol.\n\nOption 3 — Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n- Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL block for you to run on your server.\n\nWhen you choose an option, also tell me whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only supply SQL text. If you pick Option 1 and provide credentials, indicate whether I should attempt to connect from this container or you will run the SQL I provide and paste back results.",
