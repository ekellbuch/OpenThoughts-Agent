  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally (attempting to connect to the default socket returned ERROR 2002). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf file with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or connection details for a remote server. As a result I cannot run any SQL against a database right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three paths and provide the necessary details. Options:\n\n1) Query an existing MySQL server (recommended): Provide host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf in the container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also give the exact database question (which database/table/columns and desired result). After you provide credentials and the question I will explain the approach and then, per your protocol, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I will analyze further.\n\n2) Install and start a local server in this container: Confirm you want me to install MariaDB or MySQL locally. If confirmed I will run the install and start commands, initialize the server, and then create/load schema/data as you request. After the server is running I will run queries under your one-SQL-per-turn protocol.\n\n3) Produce SQL only (no execution here): Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or descriptions of relevant tables/columns) and the question. I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL block for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the required details (connection credentials, or confirm server install choice, or schema + question). Also indicate whether you want me to operate (Action: Operation) or only provide SQL text. I will not run any commands until you confirm.",
