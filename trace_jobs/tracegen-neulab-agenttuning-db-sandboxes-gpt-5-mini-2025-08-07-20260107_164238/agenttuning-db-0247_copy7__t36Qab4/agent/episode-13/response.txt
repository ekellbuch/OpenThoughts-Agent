  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44) but no MySQL server is running locally (attempt to connect to the default socket failed). There are no MYSQL_* environment variables and no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. You have not provided a database question, schema, or connection details. Therefore I cannot run any SQL or answer a database question yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options and provide the necessary details. Below I list the options and exactly what I need from you for each. Once you choose, I will explain the SQL approach and, if you request an operation, produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block). After you run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will continue.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n   - Provide: host (or IP), port (omit if 3306), username, and password (or create /root/.my.cnf inside this container with [client] credentials and tell me). Also provide the exact database question (which database/table/columns and what you want).\n   - If you put credentials in /root/.my.cnf, the file should look like (example):\n     [client]\\n     user=youruser\\n     password=yourpassword\\n     host=yourhost\n     and set permissions: chmod 600 /root/.my.cnf\n   - After you provide credentials + question I will prepare one SQL statement per your protocol and ask you to run it.\n\n2) Start a local server inside this container:\n   - Confirm you want me to install and start a local database and tell me whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB.\n   - If confirmed I will: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server); start the service; optionally set a root password or create a database/schema you specify. Then I can run queries locally under your protocol.\n\n3) Produce SQL only (no execution here):\n   - Provide the schema (CREATE TABLE statements or column descriptions) and the question.\n   - I will explain the approach and provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL block for you to run on your server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the requested details (connection credentials, or confirm server install, or schema + question). I will not run any commands until you confirm. If you choose Option 1 and supply credentials, indicate whether you want me to connect and run the query here, or whether you will run the single SQL I provide and paste back the output.",
