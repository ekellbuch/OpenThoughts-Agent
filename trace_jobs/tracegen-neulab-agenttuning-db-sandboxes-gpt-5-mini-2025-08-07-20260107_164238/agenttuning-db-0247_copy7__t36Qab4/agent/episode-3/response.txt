  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (connection via socket failed) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables or a ~/.my.cnf providing credentials. /etc/mysql only contains default client config. I couldn't check open ports because ss is not available in the container. The container currently has no database to query unless you provide connection details to a running MySQL server (host, port, user, password) or you want me to install and start a local server here.",
  "plan": "I will not run further package changes automatically. Please tell me the database question you want answered and provide connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, and password or a ~/.my.cnf with credentials). Alternatives: if you want a local server created in this container, tell me and I will install and start MariaDB/MySQL and initialize a database. Once I have connection details or choose to start a local server, I'll run a single SQL statement per your protocol. If you provide the question now, I'll explain my approach and then either (A) produce an Action: Operation with one SQL statement (in SQL markdown, single line) for you to execute, or (B) connect and run the SQL myself if you supply credentials for me to use here.",
