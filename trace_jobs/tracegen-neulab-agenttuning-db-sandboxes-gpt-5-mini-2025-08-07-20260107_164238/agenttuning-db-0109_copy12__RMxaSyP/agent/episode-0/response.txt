  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt in /app with no prior commands executed in this session (bash job-control warnings are present). There is no visible MySQL activity yet. Before I can run SQL against a MySQL server I need to: (1) locate a mysql client binary, (2) look for credentials (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, ~/.my.cnf, env vars like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, or service config files), (3) check whether a MySQL server process is running and what port it's listening on, and (4) find any SQL files in the repo that might indicate the schema or the question context. Nothing has been accomplished yet toward connecting to the DB; we need to collect environment and configuration information first. Also, I haven't been given the specific question you want answered yet—once you provide it I will craft a single SQL statement (as required) to run against the database.",
  "plan": "I will inspect the container environment to find the MySQL client, any credentials, whether a MySQL server is running, and any SQL or config files that could help. Specifically I will: (1) confirm user and working directory, (2) list files in /app and common config locations, (3) try to read /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (Debian/Ubuntu often stores administrative creds there), (4) check environment variables for MYSQL-related entries, (5) check for ~/.my.cnf or other config files, (6) detect a running mysqld process and what port it's listening on, and (7) search for SQL files. After this inspection I'll report findings and ask for the question you want answered (or, if credentials are found, propose the SQL to run).",
