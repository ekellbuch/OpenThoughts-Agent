  "analysis": "Current state: I'm at a root shell in /app. I checked for MySQL client, server, typical config files, environment variables, and SQL files — nothing was found. No /etc/mysql, no mysql client binary, no mysqld process, no Debian MySQL credentials. The container does not appear to have a local MySQL server or client installed, nor obvious config or SQL files in /app. To run SQL I need either (A) a mysql client in the environment and a running MySQL server (local or reachable over network) with credentials, or (B) the user to provide the question plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or a SQL dump to operate on. Right now no DB is accessible from this container.",
  "plan": "I'll search common locations for MySQL binaries, libraries, sockets, data directories, and installed packages to be sure nothing was missed. Specifically: check /usr/bin and /usr/sbin for mysql client/binaries, check /usr/lib for mysql libs, check /var/run and /var/lib for mysqld socket and data, search for any Unix domain sockets (*.sock) on the filesystem, and query package managers (dpkg/rpm) to see if MySQL/MariaDB is installed but not started. After these checks I'll report findings. If none are present, I'll ask you to provide the database question and connection credentials or a SQL dump/SQL file to operate on.",
