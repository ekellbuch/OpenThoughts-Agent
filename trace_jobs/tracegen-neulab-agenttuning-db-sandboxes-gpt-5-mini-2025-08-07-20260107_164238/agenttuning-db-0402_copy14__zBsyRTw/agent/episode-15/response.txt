  "analysis": "The container shell is ready at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. Previous discovery shows: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. I cannot run SQL here until you either run SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output back, or provide remote DB credentials and explicit permission to install a client and connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with: \"Option A: <your question>\" where <your question> is the exact database question (examples: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\").\n- I will explain the SQL I'll run and expected result, then provide exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission)\n- Reply with: \"Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\" to provide connection details and explicit permission to install a mysql client here. If you prefer a password prompt, set password=prompt.\n- If you permit installation, I will run minimal commands to install a client and then connect. I will still output only one SQL statement per round and act on the raw MySQL output you (or I) obtain.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact question, or Option B plus connection details and install permission. Once you reply I will (1) explain the intended SQL and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for execution.",
