  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). I previously ran discovery commands and confirmed: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process is running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and there are no MySQL configuration files under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or any remote connection credentials. Because of that, I cannot run queries from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two ways to proceed. Reply with exactly one of the templates below (copy/paste and fill in values). After you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block). You or I (if I connect) will execute only that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n  Reply exactly: Option A: <your question>\n  Example valid replies you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit install permission):\n  Reply exactly: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or, to be prompted for the password instead of including it: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n  Note: include install=allow only if you explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client in this container. If you choose Option B with install=allow I will install a minimal client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule.\n\nInteraction rules reminder (I will follow exactly):\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round inside an \"Action: Operation\" block (single-line SQL in a SQL code block).\n- You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze it and continue.\n- When certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact database question, or Option B plus the connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow).",
