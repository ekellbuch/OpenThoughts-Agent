  "analysis": "The shell prompt is idle at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. Previous checks established there is no local MySQL client (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, and no MySQL config files under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run SQL from this container until you either run SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output back, or provide remote DB credentials and explicit permission for me to install a client and connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options and reply accordingly so I can proceed.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with: \"Option A: <your question>\"\n  Example questions you can copy: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\".\n- I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then provide exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission)\n- Reply with: \"Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\" to give connection details and explicit permission to install a MySQL client in this container. If you prefer a password prompt, use password=prompt.\n- If you permit installation I will run a minimal install (for example: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you are uncertain, pick one example question above and reply with Option A and that question. If you want me to connect, reply with Option B and include the connection details plus install=allow. After you reply I will (1) explain the intended SQL and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format.",
