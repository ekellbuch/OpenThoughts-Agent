  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). I previously ran discovery commands and confirmed: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld server process, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config was found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of these two options and reply accordingly:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n- Reply with: \"Option A: <your question>\" where <your question> is the exact database question (examples: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\").\n- I will explain the SQL I'll run and expected result, then provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answers.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission to install client):\n- Reply with: \"Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\" (or password=prompt). Include install=allow if the mysql client needs to be installed here.\n- If you permit installation I will run a minimal client install (for example: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect using the provided credentials. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round (Action: Operation), execute it, and parse the raw MySQL output before continuing.\n\nNotes you must follow for the interaction:\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round inside an \"Action: Operation\" block. You (or I if I connect) must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will then analyze and continue.\n- When I'm certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A and the exact question, or Option B and the connection details plus explicit install permission. I will not run any further shell commands until you choose.",
