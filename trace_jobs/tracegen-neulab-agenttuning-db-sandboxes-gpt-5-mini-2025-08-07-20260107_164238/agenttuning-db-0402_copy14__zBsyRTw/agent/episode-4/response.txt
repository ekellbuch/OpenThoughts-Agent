  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt inside the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). No commands have been run in this session and there is no MySQL client output shown. You have not provided a specific question about a MySQL database, nor have you provided connection credentials or indicated whether I should connect from this shell or you will run SQL and paste results. In short: the environment is idle and I have no information about the database schema or data to act on.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to (A) state the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database and (B) choose how to proceed: either\n  - Option 1 (you run SQL): I will produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required 'Action: Operation' single-line SQL block for you to execute locally and paste back the raw MySQL output; or\n  - Option 2 (I run SQL from this shell): you provide connection details or allow me to run the mysql client here (for example by giving the mysql command or credentials), and I will connect and run statements directly, one at a time.\nIf you want me to discover whether MySQL is present and running in the container before giving the question, tell me to proceed and I will run a small set of discovery commands. Suggested discovery commands (run them only if you want me to probe the container):\n  - mysql -V  (show mysql client version)\n  - ps aux | grep mysqld  (see if server process is running)\n  - ss -ltnp | grep mysql  (check listening ports for mysql)\n  - ls -la /var/lib/mysql  (inspect data directory)\n  - cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf  (inspect config)\n  - mysql -u root -p -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"  (quick attempt to list databases; prompts for password)\nWhen you tell me the question and the mode, I will: 1) explain my approach and expected result, and 2) provide a single SQL statement formatted exactly as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). After you execute it and return the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer format.",
