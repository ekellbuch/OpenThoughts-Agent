  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Previous discovery commands confirmed: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld server running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. In short: there is no local MySQL client or server to run queries here; I cannot execute SQL against any database from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed with SQL until you choose one of two options. Please reply with exactly one of the two templates below (copy-paste and fill in values) so I can continue. After you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block). You or I (if I connect) will run only that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n  Reply exactly: Option A: <your question>\n  Example valid replies you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n  After that I will: explain the SQL I'll use and provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. You must run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back here.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit install permission):\n  Reply exactly: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or, to be prompted for the password instead of including it: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n  Note: include install=allow only if you explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client in this container. If you choose Option B with install=allow I will run a minimal client install and connect, then follow the single-SQL-per-round rule.\n\nIf you choose Option B, these are the exact shell commands I will run (only if you include install=allow). I am not running them now; this is so you know what will happen if you permit it:\n  apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p\n(If you supply password=prompt I will prompt; if you include the password inline I will use -p<password>.)\n\nInteraction rules reminder (I will follow exactly):\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round inside an \"Action: Operation\" block (a single-line SQL code block). You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze it and continue.\n- When certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact database question, or Option B plus connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow). I will wait for your choice and will not run any shell commands until you explicitly instruct me to.",
