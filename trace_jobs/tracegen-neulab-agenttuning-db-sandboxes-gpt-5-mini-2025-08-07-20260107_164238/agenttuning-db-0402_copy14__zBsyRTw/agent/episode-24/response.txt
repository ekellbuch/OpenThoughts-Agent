  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Prior discovery shows: the MySQL client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL configuration files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. In short: there is no local MySQL client/server to run queries here; I cannot execute SQL against any database from this container unless you either run SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output back, or provide remote DB credentials and explicit permission for me to install a client here and connect.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two ways to proceed. Reply exactly with one of the templates below (copy-paste and fill in values) so I can continue. After you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block). You or I (if I connect) will run only that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will then parse it and continue.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n  Reply with: Option A: <your question>\n  Example valid replies you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit install permission):\n  Reply with: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or, to use a password prompt instead of exposing it here:\n    Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n  Note: include install=allow only if you explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client in this container. If you permit installation I will run a minimal client install and then connect. I will still follow the single-statement-per-round rule.\n\nIf you are unsure which question to ask, pick one of the example Option A lines above. If you want me to connect, include full connection details and install=allow. I will not run or install anything until you explicitly choose Option B with install=allow.",
