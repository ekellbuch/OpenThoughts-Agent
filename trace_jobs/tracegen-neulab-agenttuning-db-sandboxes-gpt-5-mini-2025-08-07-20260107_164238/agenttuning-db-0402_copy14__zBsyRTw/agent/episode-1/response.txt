  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you provide the question about the MySQL database and indicate how you want me to operate: either (A) you will run the single SQL statement I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output, or (B) provide credentials / allow me to connect from this shell so I can run statements directly. Please tell me the exact question to answer (for example: list users, count rows in a table, find rows matching a condition, etc.). If you want me to connect from this shell, provide the mysql client command or credentials (host, port, user, password, database). If you prefer to run commands yourself, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block) for you to execute and return its output. Optional helper commands I can run here to discover a local MySQL install (only if you permit): - ls -la /etc/mysql\n- ps aux | grep mysql\n- mysql -V\nI will wait for your instruction and the question before producing any SQL.",
