  "analysis": "The shell is idle at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. Earlier discovery shows there is no local MySQL client (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run SQL here until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste the raw MySQL output back, or (B) provide remote DB credentials and explicit permission for me to install a client and connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "Please pick one of the two options below so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with: \"Option A: <your question>\" where <your question> is the exact database question (examples: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = \\'active\\' limit 100\").\n- I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then provide exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (I may need to install a client)\n- Reply with: \"Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\" to provide connection details and explicit permission to install a MySQL client in this container. If you prefer a password prompt, set password=prompt.\n- If you permit installation I will run a minimal install (for example: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect. I will still follow the rule of issuing exactly one SQL statement per round and you will see the raw MySQL output here.\n\nWhen you reply, I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute (or for me to execute if Option B and I connect).",
