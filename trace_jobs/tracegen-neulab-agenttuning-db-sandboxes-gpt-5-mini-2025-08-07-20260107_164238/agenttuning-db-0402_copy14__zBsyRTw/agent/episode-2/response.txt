  "plan": "I will wait for you to: (A) provide the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database, and (B) choose how you want me to operate: either (1) you will run the single SQL statement I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back here, or (2) provide connection details/permission so I can connect from this shell and run statements directly. Once you tell me the question and the mode, I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). If you want me to connect from this shell, provide either the mysql client command to use or credentials (host, port, user, password, database). Helpful commands you can run (or I can run if you permit) to discover local MySQL state: - mysql -V  (shows client version)\n- ps aux | grep mysqld  (see if server running)\n- ls -la /var/lib/mysql  (inspect data dir)\n- cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf  (inspect config)\nIf you choose to run statements yourself, tell me the question now and I will return the single SQL statement to execute.",
