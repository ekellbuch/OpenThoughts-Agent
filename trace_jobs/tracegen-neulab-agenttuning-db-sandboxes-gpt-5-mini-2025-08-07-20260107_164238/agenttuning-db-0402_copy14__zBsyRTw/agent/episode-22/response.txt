  "analysis": "You are at a root shell inside the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). I previously ran discovery and confirmed: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process is running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run SQL from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and reply exactly as specified so I can continue:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n- Reply with: Option A: <your question>\n  Example valid replies you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n- After you send that, I will: (1) explain the SQL I plan to run and expected result, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit permission to install a client):\n- Reply with: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  - If you prefer a password prompt instead of including it in the reply, use password=prompt.\n  - The install=allow token explicitly permits me to install a mysql client in this container if needed.\n- If you choose Option B and include install=allow, I will install a minimal client and connect, then follow the same single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round (Action: Operation) and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nInteraction rules I will follow exactly:\n- I will only ever output one SQL statement per operation round, inside an Action: Operation block with a single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block.\n- You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only that first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output here. I will analyze it and continue accordingly.\n- When done and certain of the final answer, I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply now with either Option A plus the exact question, or Option B plus the connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow). I will not run any further shell commands until you choose.",
