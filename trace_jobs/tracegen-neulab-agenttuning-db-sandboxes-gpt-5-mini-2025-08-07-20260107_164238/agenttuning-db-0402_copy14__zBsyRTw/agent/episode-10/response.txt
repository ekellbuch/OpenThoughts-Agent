  "analysis": "The container shell is idle (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Previous discovery confirmed: no mysql client installed, no mysqld server running, no /var/lib/mysql, and no my.cnf present. You have not given a specific database question, nor provided remote connection credentials or permission to install a client. Therefore I cannot run any SQL from this environment right now and no database operations have been performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL and paste results\n- Tell me the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database (examples: \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in table orders\", \"select * from users where status = 'active'\", \"show databases\", etc.).\n- I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules inside an Action: Operation block (single-line SQL in a single SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse the output and either issue another single SQL or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission)\n- Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate a password prompt), and database name or which DB to use. Also explicitly confirm I may install a client in this container if needed.\n- If you permit installation I will run minimal install steps (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or equivalent) and then connect (mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p). I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule and you will see raw MySQL output here.\n\nIf you are unsure what to ask, here are common example questions you can pick from:\n- \"Show all databases.\"  (I would issue: SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM information_schema.SCHEMATA; or use SHOW DATABASES; )\n- \"List tables in database mydb.\"  (I would issue: SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='mydb'; )\n- \"Count rows in mydb.users.\"  (I would issue: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.users; )\n- \"Show rows where status = 'active' in mydb.users.\"  (I would issue: SELECT * FROM mydb.users WHERE status='active' LIMIT 100; )\n\nImportant interaction rules reminder:\n- When I produce SQL it will be exactly one statement in a single SQL code block; you will execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw output back. I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round.\n- When I finish and am sure of the answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option A\" plus the exact database question you want answered (so I can produce the single SQL to run), or\n- \"Option B\" plus connection details and explicit permission to install a client in the container.\n\nOnce you choose, I will (1) state my reasoning and expected result, and (2) emit the single SQL statement to execute.",
