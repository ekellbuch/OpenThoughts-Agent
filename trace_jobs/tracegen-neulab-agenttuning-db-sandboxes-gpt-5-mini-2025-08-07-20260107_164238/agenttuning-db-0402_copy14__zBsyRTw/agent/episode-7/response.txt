  "analysis": "The container shell is idle (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). My previous discovery showed: no mysql client installed, no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, and no MySQL config files. In short, there is no local MySQL server or client available in this environment, so I cannot run SQL here without either (A) you running SQL elsewhere and pasting raw MySQL output back to me, or (B) you providing remote MySQL connection details and permission for me to install a client here and connect.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these two options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Tell me the exact question about the database (for example: list tables in database X; count rows in table Y; find rows where column Z = 'value'; etc.).\n- I will explain my approach and then provide exactly one SQL statement inside the required \"Action: Operation\" single-line SQL block for you to execute with your mysql client. You must run only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the required \"Action: Answer\" format.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires your credentials and permission to install a client)\n- Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and database name (or tell me which DB to use). Also confirm I may install a client in this container.\n- If you permit installation, I will run minimal install commands (e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) then connect using mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database> and proceed. I will then follow the same single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format, you will execute it (or I will execute it here) and I will parse the raw output and continue until completion.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide either the precise database question (Option A) or the connection info and installation permission (Option B).",
