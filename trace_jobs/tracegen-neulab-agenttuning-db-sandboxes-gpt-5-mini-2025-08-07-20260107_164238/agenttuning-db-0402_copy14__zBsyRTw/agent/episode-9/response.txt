  "analysis": "The shell prompt is idle in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Prior discovery showed: no mysql client installed, no mysqld server process, no /var/lib/mysql directory, and no MySQL config files present. You have not provided a database question, any SQL to run, nor remote connection credentials. No SQL has been executed in this session.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL here unless you either (A) execute SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output back to me, or (B) provide remote MySQL connection details and permission for me to install a client and connect from this shell. Please choose one of the following and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with Option A and the exact question you want answered (examples: \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in table orders\", \"select * from users where status = 'active'\", etc.).\n- I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your mysql client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell\n- Reply with Option B and provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and database name (or tell me which DB to use). Also confirm I may install a MySQL client in this container.\n- If you permit installation I will run minimal install commands (e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) then connect and proceed. I will still emit exactly one SQL statement per round and you will see the raw MySQL output here.\n\nIf you want me to probe/install automatically, explicitly grant permission for me to install the client. Once you choose an option and provide the necessary details or question, I will (1) explain the intended SQL and expected result, and (2) output the single SQL statement to run in the required format.",
