  "analysis": "The container shell is ready at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. Recent discovery (from earlier commands) shows: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld server process, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL here or query any database until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste the raw MySQL output back here, or (B) provide remote DB connection details and explicit permission for me to install a MySQL client in this container and connect.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options. Pick one and reply accordingly.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n- Reply: Option A: <your exact question>\n  Example questions: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\".\n- I will then: (1) explain the SQL I intend to run and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block. You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answers.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (I may need to install a client):\n- Reply: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow  (or password=prompt to be prompted)\n- You must explicitly include install=allow if the mysql client needs installing. If permitted, I will run minimal install commands (for example: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect using the provided credentials. After connecting I will follow the same rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round (Action: Operation), execute it, and parse the raw MySQL output shown here before continuing.\n\nNotes and constraints I will follow exactly:\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round inside the required Action: Operation single-line SQL block.\n- You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL statement or produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact database question, or Option B plus connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow) so I can proceed. I will not run any additional shell commands in this environment until you choose an option.",
