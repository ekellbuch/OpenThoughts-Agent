  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). My earlier discovery shows: mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. I cannot run SQL here until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output back, or (B) provide remote DB credentials and explicit permission for me to install a client here and connect.",
  "plan": "Please pick one of the two options below and reply accordingly so I can continue.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with: Option A: <your question>\n  Example questions you can copy: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\".\n- I will: (1) explain the SQL I intend to run, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (SQL in a single code block). You must execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (I may need to install a client)\n- Reply with: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  - Provide the connection details and explicitly allow installation (install=allow) if the mysql client is not present. If you prefer a password prompt, say password=prompt and I will run mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p to prompt.\n- If you permit installation, I will run a minimal install (for example: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output one SQL statement per round in the required format and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nNotes and reminders\n- I will always output only one SQL statement per operation round and it must be executed exactly as given if you are running it. I will only read and analyze the raw MySQL output you paste back.\n- When finished and certain of the result, I will produce: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus your exact question, or Option B plus connection details and explicit installation permission. If you want me to probe/install automatically, reply with Option B and include install=allow.",
