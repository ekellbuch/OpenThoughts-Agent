  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt in a container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session. There is no active MySQL client connection visible and no SQL has been executed. The environment appears ready for me to run commands, but you have not yet asked a specific question about the database or provided database credentials/schema. What has been accomplished: a shell is available. What still needs to be done: you must (1) provide the exact question you want answered, and (2) provide access details (or allow me to open a mysql client in the environment) so I can run a single SQL statement per your rules. Once you give the question, I will produce one SQL statement (in the required markdown format) to run. After you execute it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze and either run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL now because you haven't provided the question. Instead I will: 1) Ask you to state the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database; 2) Ask you to either provide DB connection credentials or run the mysql client yourself and be ready to paste raw MySQL output after I provide a single SQL statement; 3) When you provide the question, I will (a) explain my reasoning and expected result, and (b) emit exactly one SQL statement inside a markdown code block (one-line). That statement will be the first to execute. After you run it and give me the output, I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or conclude and provide the final answer in the required Answer format. Suggested commands you can run locally if you want me to operate directly from this shell (not executed automatically): - To connect to MySQL as root with password prompt: mysql -u root -p  OR if socket/credentials differ, provide the proper command. - To inspect files/configs if needed: ls -la /app\n cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf\nHowever I will wait for your question and permission to proceed.",
