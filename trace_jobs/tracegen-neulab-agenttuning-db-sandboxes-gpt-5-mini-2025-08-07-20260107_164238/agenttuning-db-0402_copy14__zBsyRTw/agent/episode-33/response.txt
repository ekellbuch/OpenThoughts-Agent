  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt inside the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). I previously ran discovery commands and the results show: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld server process running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL configuration files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. Because of that, I cannot run queries from this container as-is. No further actions have been taken since my last message.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and reply exactly as specified (copy/paste and fill in values). After you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block). You or I (if I connect) will execute only that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n  Reply exactly: Option A: <your question>\n  Example valid replies you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n  After you send that I will explain the intended query and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. You must run only that SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back here.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit install permission):\n  Reply exactly: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or, to be prompted for the password instead of including it: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n  Note: include install=allow only if you explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client in this container. If you choose Option B with install=allow I will install a minimal client and connect, then follow the same single-SQL-per-round rule (I will output one SQL statement per round inside Action: Operation). If you prefer not to include the password in the message, use password=prompt.\n\nIf you are unsure which question to ask, copy one of the example Option A lines above. If you want me to connect, include the full connection details and install=allow. I will not run any further shell commands or install anything until you explicitly provide one of the two replies above.",
