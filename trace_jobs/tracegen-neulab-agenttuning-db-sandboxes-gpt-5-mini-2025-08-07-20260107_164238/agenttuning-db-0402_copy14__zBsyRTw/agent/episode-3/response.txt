You have not yet provided a concrete question about the MySQL database, nor have you provided credentials or instructed me to connect from this shell. In short: the environment is ready, but I have no database question or access details to act on.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide two things before issuing any SQL: (1) the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database (for example: count rows in a table, list schema, find rows with a condition, etc.), and (2) how you want me to operate: either (A) you will run the single SQL statement I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output, or (B) you give connection details or permission for me to connect from this shell so I can run statements directly. If you want me to inspect the container for a local MySQL installation first, I can run discovery commands (mysql -V, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, etc.) — tell me which of those I should run. Once you specify the question and the mode, I will: - Explain my approach and expected result. - Provide exactly one SQL statement inside a single SQL code block (Action: Operation) on one line (which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output). After you return the output I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.",
