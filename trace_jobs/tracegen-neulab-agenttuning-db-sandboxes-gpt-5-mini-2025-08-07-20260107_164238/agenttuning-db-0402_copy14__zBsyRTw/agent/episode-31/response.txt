  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt inside the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). I already ran discovery: mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process is present, /var/lib/mysql doesn't exist, and there is no MySQL configuration under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment, and you have not provided a database question nor any remote connection credentials. Because of that, I cannot run queries from this container without either (A) you running SQL elsewhere and pasting the raw MySQL output here, or (B) providing remote DB credentials and explicit permission for me to install a MySQL client and connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "I will not run or install anything until you explicitly choose one of these two modes. Please reply using exactly one of the templates below (copy/paste and fill in values) so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n  Reply exactly: Option A: <your question>\n  Examples you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n\n  If you choose Option A, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an \"Action: Operation\" block (a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit install permission):\n  Reply exactly: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or to be prompted for the password instead of including it: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n\n  Notes: include install=allow only if you explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client in this container. If you choose Option B with install=allow I will run a minimal client install and then connect. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule (I will output one SQL statement per round in the required format and act on the returned raw MySQL output).\n\nImportant interaction rules I will follow exactly:\n- I will only ever output one SQL statement per round inside an \"Action: Operation\" block (single-line SQL in a SQL code block).\n- You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze it and continue.\n- When certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact database question, or Option B plus the connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow).",
