  "analysis": "The container shell is idle at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. From earlier discovery: there is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server running, no /var/lib/mysql directory, and no MySQL config under /etc. No SQL has been executed in this environment. I cannot run SQL here until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste the raw MySQL output back, or (B) provide remote DB credentials and explicitly allow me to install a client here and connect.",
  "plan": "I will not run anything until you choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details.\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Tell me the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in table orders\", \"select * from users where status = 'active'\", etc.).\n- I will explain the reasoning and then give exactly one SQL statement (in the required Action: Operation format with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL with your mysql client and paste the raw MySQL output here. I will parse it and either give another single SQL or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission)\n- Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate password prompt), and database name (or which DB to use). Explicitly confirm you permit me to install a mysql client in this container.\n- If you permit installation I will run the minimal commands to install a client and then connect. Example install/connect commands I would run if you approve (I will not run them unless you explicitly allow):\n  apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p\n- After connecting I will follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output one SQL statement in the required format, execute it (or you will execute it if you prefer), and parse the raw MySQL output to continue.\n\nIf you are unsure what to ask, here are common example requests you can copy:\n- \"Option A: show databases\"\n- \"Option A: list tables in database mydb\"\n- \"Option A: count rows in mydb.users\"\n- \"Option B: connect\" (and then paste host, port, user, password, database and confirm installation permission)\n\nOnce you respond with Option A + question or Option B + credentials+install-permission, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for execution.",
