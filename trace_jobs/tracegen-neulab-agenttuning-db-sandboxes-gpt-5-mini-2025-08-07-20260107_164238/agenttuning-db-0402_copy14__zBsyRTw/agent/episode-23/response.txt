  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Previous discovery showed: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. I cannot run SQL from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two ways to proceed. Reply with exactly one of the two options below (copy-paste one of the example reply formats). After you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement inside an Action: Operation block (a single-line SQL code block) which you or I (if I connect) will execute. Option A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n  Reply with: Option A: <your question>\n  Examples you can copy: \n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n  I will then provide exactly one SQL statement for you to run and you must paste the raw MySQL output back here.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit permission to install a client):\n  Reply with: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or, if you prefer a password prompt: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n  The token install=allow explicitly permits me to install a MySQL client here if needed. If you choose Option B I will install the minimal client, connect, and follow the single-SQL-per-round rule.\n\nNotes/Constraints (must be followed):\n- I will only ever output one SQL statement per round inside the required Action: Operation block (single-line SQL in a SQL code block). You (or I if I connect) must execute only that first SQL code block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse it and continue.\n- When I'm certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact database question, or Option B plus connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow).",
