  "analysis": "The container shell is idle at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. Earlier discovery confirmed: no mysql client present (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, no /var/lib/mysql directory, and no MySQL config under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. I cannot run SQL here until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output back, or (B) provide remote DB credentials and permit me to install a client and connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with: \"Option A: <your question>\" where <your question> is the exact database question (examples below). I will then: (1) explain the SQL I intend to run and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation block (single-line SQL). You must execute only that SQL with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will parse it and continue.\n\nCommon example questions you can copy:\n- \"show databases\"\n- \"list tables in database mydb\"\n- \"count rows in mydb.users\"\n- \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\"\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (I may need to install client)\n- Reply with: \"Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\" to give credentials and explicit permission to install a mysql client here.\n- If permitted, I will run a minimal install (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect using mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output one SQL statement per round in the required format and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you want me to probe the container further or to install the client now, explicitly choose Option B and include install=allow. Otherwise, choose Option A and provide the exact question to answer.\n\nI will wait for your choice and the required information before issuing any SQL or making changes.",
