  "analysis": "The container shell is available (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Previous discovery confirmed there is no local MySQL client or server (mysql client missing, no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no my.cnf). You have not provided a database question, any MySQL query to run, nor remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot execute SQL from this environment and I have not executed any commands in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two ways to proceed and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Tell me the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database (examples: \"list tables in database X\", \"count rows in table orders\", \"select users with status = 'active'\", etc.).\n- I will explain the approach and then provide exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (I may need to install client)\n- Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate passwordless auth), and database name (or which database to use).\n- Confirm you allow me to install a MySQL client here. If you permit installation I will run minimal install commands (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or equivalent) and then connect and run SQL directly. I will still follow your rule of issuing exactly one SQL statement per round and you will see raw MySQL output here.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option A\" plus the exact database question (so I can produce the single SQL to run), or\n- \"Option B\" plus the connection details and permission to install the client.\n\nIf you want me to first probe the container further (e.g., to install client automatically), say so and I will run the minimal install and connect steps.",
