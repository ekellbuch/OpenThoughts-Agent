  "analysis": "The container shell is idle at root@f86fde47454c:/app#. Prior checks show there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server running, no /var/lib/mysql directory, and no MySQL config under /etc. You have not provided a database question, any SQL to run, nor remote connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run SQL here or access any database until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste the raw MySQL output back, or (B) provide remote DB credentials and explicit permission for me to install a MySQL client in this container and connect.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results\n- Reply with: \"Option A: <your question>\" where <your question> is the exact database question (examples: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = \\'active\\' limit 100\").\n- I will explain the SQL I will use and expected result, then produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation single-line SQL code block for you to execute. You must run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either issue another single SQL or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission)\n- Reply with: \"Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\" to provide connection details and explicit permission for me to install a MySQL client here. If you prefer the password be prompted, set password=prompt.\n- If you permit installation I will run a minimal install (for example: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect with the provided credentials. I will still follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you are unsure what to ask, example requests you can copy for Option A: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\". If you want me to probe and install the client now, choose Option B and include install=allow. I will not run any installation or connection commands until you explicitly choose Option B and permit installation.",
