  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Prior discovery confirmed: no mysql client is installed (mysql: command not found), no MySQL server process is running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question or remote connection credentials. I cannot query any database from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "You must choose how to proceed. I describe two safe options; pick one and reply accordingly.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n- Reply with: Option A: <your question>\n  Example questions: \"show databases\", \"list tables in database mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\".\n- I will then: (1) explain the SQL I intend to run and expected result, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single SQL statement inside an \"Action: Operation\" block (SQL in a single markdown code block). You must execute only that first SQL code block with your mysql client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the final answer list.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (only if you provide credentials and allow installing a client):\n- Reply with: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow  (or password=prompt to be prompted)\n- If you include install=allow I will run a minimal install of a MySQL client (e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then connect. After connection I will follow the same single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in an \"Action: Operation\" block and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nImportant interaction rules reminder (I will follow these exactly):\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round inside the required \"Action: Operation\" block.\n- You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back.\n- Once I'm sure of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nIf you pick Option A, include the exact question now and I will produce the single SQL statement to run. If you pick Option B, provide connection info and explicit install permission and I will perform the minimal client install and connect.",
