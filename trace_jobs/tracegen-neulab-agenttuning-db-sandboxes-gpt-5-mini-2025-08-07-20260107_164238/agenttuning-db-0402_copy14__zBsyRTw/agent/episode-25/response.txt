  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Previous discovery showed: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld server process running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no MySQL config files were found under /etc. No SQL has been executed from this environment and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. I cannot run any SQL from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "I will not perform any installs or connections until you explicitly choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options below and reply exactly as requested so I can continue:\n\nOption A — You run SQL and paste results (recommended if you control the DB):\n- Reply with: Option A: <your question>\n  Example valid replies you can copy:\n    Option A: show databases\n    Option A: list tables in database mydb\n    Option A: count rows in mydb.users\n    Option A: select * from mydb.users where status = 'active' limit 100\n- I will then: (1) explain the SQL I will issue and expected result, and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement inside an \"Action: Operation\" block (a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your MySQL client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and explicit install permission):\n- Reply with: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<db> install=allow\n  Or, to be prompted for the password instead of including it: Option B: host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=prompt database=<db> install=allow\n- The token install=allow explicitly permits me to install a MySQL client in this container if needed. If you choose Option B with install=allow I will run a minimal client install and connect, then follow the single-SQL-per-round rule: I will output exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format and act on the returned raw MySQL output.\n\nNotes:\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per round inside the required \"Action: Operation\" block.\n- You (or I if Option B and I connect) must execute only that first SQL block and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse it and continue.\n- When certain of the final answer I will output: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease reply with either Option A plus the exact database question, or Option B plus connection details and explicit install permission (install=allow).",
