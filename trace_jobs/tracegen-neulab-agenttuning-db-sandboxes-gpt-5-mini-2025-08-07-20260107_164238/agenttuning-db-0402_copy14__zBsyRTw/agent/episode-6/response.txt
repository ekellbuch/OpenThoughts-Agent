  "analysis": "I ran discovery commands in the container. Results: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld server process running, nettool commands (ss/netstat) are not present, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and there is no MySQL config present under /etc/mysql or /etc/my.cnf. In short: there is no local MySQL server or client available in this container and I cannot run SQL here without either installing a client and connecting to a remote server or you running SQL elsewhere and pasting the raw MySQL output.",
  "plan": "I will not run or install anything unless you instruct me to. Please choose one of these two options so we can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself and paste output\n- Tell me the precise question you want answered about the database (for example: count rows in table X, show rows matching condition Y, list tables in database Z, etc.).\n- I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL (I will only consider the first SQL code block) using your mysql client, then paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse it and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final Answer.\n\nOption B — Let me connect from this shell (I will install client if you permit)\n- Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate passwordless access), and database name (or say which DB to use). Confirm you allow me to install the mysql client here if it is missing.\n- If you permit installation I will run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or appropriate package) and then connect using: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> <database>\n- After connecting I will follow your question and emit exactly one SQL statement at a time in the required format; you will see the raw output here and I will continue accordingly.\n\nNotes about the interaction and constraints\n- Per your rules I will only ever output one SQL statement per operation round, inside a single SQL code block, and you will execute only that first SQL block and paste back the raw results. After receiving that raw output I will analyze and either provide another single SQL or finish with Action: Answer.\n- If you choose Option A, tell me the exact question now and whether you want me to (a) list tables, (b) count rows, (c) select rows matching a condition, etc. I will then produce the single SQL to run.\n- If you choose Option B, provide the connection credentials and confirm I may install the client; I will then run the minimal commands to install/connect and proceed with the SQL steps.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also provide a SQL client command that already works in this environment (for example: mysql -h host -u user -p -D db) and I will use it directly once you confirm.",
