  "analysis": "The container shell is ready (root@f86fde47454c:/app#) but no commands have been run in this session and there is no active MySQL client or SQL output. You haven't provided the database question or credentials. To proceed I need to discover whether a MySQL server or client is present and reachable from this container, and gather any local config that could help me connect (socket, port, default datadir).",
  "plan": "I will run a small set of discovery commands to determine whether MySQL/MariaDB is installed and/or running in this container and to locate configuration files and the data directory. Specifically:\n- mysql -V: check for a MySQL client binary and its version\n- ps aux | grep mysqld | grep -v grep: see if a MySQL server process is running and note its PID/args\n- ss -ltnp | grep 3306 (fallback to netstat if ss not present): check whether anything is listening on the default MySQL port\n- ls -la /var/lib/mysql: inspect the default data directory (presence of databases and permissions)\n- cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf (and fallback /etc/my.cnf) to view server config such as socket/port/datadir\nThese commands will help me decide how to connect or what I should ask you for (credentials or whether you'll run SQL locally). After you review the outputs I will explain the next SQL statement to run or request connection details.",
