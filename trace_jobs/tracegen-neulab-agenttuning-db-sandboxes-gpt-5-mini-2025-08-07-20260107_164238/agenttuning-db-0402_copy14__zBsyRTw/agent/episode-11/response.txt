  "analysis": "You are at a root shell prompt inside the container (root@f86fde47454c:/app#). Prior discovery showed there is no local MySQL client or server (mysql not installed, no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, no my.cnf). No SQL has been run here and you have not provided a database question, schema, or remote connection credentials. I cannot execute SQL from this environment until you either (A) run SQL elsewhere and paste raw MySQL output here, or (B) provide remote DB credentials and permit me to install a client and connect from this shell.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options below and provide the required information so I can proceed.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL and paste results\n- Tell me the exact question you want answered about the MySQL database (examples: \"show databases\", \"list tables in mydb\", \"count rows in mydb.users\", \"select * from mydb.users where status = 'active'\", etc.).\n- I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only that SQL statement with your mysql client and paste the raw MySQL output back here. I will parse the output and either provide another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — I connect from this shell (requires credentials and permission)\n- Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), user, password (or indicate password prompt), and database name (or which database to use). Also explicitly confirm I may install a MySQL client in this container.\n- If you permit installation I will run a minimal install (e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) then connect and proceed. I will still emit exactly one SQL statement per round and you will see the raw MySQL output here.\n\nIf you are unsure what to ask, pick one example question above and say \"Option A\" with that question. If you want me to connect, reply with \"Option B\" and the connection info plus install permission. After you reply I will (1) explain my intended SQL and expected results, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format for execution.",
