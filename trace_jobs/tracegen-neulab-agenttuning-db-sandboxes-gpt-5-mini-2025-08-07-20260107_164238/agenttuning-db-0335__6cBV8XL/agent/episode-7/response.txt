  "analysis": "We have a container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket file. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home) and found no credentials or config that would let me connect to a database. Therefore I cannot run any SQL at this time because there is no reachable database and I have no connection details or a target question to answer.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the following and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to be prompted), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Also provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"List top 5 customers by total order amount\", or \"Count rows in table orders\").\n  - Once you provide those, I will: (1) explain the single-line SQL I will run and why, and (2) output one Action: Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a code block (per your rules). You will execute that SQL with your mysql client and paste the output back; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Tell me if you want a clean server and what schema/tables/data to create (or provide SQL to populate). I will install and start a server, create the database and data, then run queries. This involves installing and starting additional packages and services.\n\nOption C — Search the filesystem more broadly for credentials/config files:\n  - If you want me to look more widely for possible credentials (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, config files), I can run a deeper grep/find across the filesystem. This may take longer. If you choose this, say 'search' and optionally specify directories to prioritize.\n\nTell me which option you want and provide any needed details. I will not run any further commands until you confirm. If you choose Option A, include the exact question to answer so I can produce the one-line SQL operation as required.",
