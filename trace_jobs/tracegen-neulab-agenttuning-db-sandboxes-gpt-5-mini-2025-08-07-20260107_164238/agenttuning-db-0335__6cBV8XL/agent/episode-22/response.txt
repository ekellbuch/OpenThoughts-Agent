  "analysis": "You are in a container that has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and prior filesystem searches did not reveal any client configs or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.). Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL against a database right now: there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or asked to create a local server or request a deeper search.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one of three clear options so I can proceed. Reply with one choice (A, B, or C) and include any requested details for that option.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' if you prefer to be prompted), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or a precise SELECT specification).\n  - After you provide these, I will explain the single-line SQL I will run and then output a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) per your rules. You will run it with your mysql client and paste the raw mysql output back to me; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and tell me whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe the schema).\n  - If you confirm, I will present the exact shell commands I will run, then install, initialize and start the server, create any requested DB/user/data, and run queries locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml).\n  - I will run a broader find/grep across the specified paths and report any candidate files that may contain connection info. This may take longer and produce many results.\n\nSecurity note: credentials you paste here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide when I output the Action: Operation.\n\nOnce you reply with exactly one option and any required details, I will proceed.",
