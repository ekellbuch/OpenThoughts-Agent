  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home) and found no credentials, .my.cnf, or application config exposing MySQL connection details. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database right now because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection credentials or a target question to answer.",
  "plan": "Choose one of the following three clear paths so I can proceed, and provide any requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing remote (or local) MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to be prompted), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in table orders\", or \"List top 5 customers by total_order_amount\").\n  - After you provide these, I will: (1) explain the single-line SQL to run and why; (2) produce an Action: Operation block containing one single-line SQL statement (in the required format). You will execute that SQL with your mysql client and paste the output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach the Final Answer.\n  - Example of how you might run the SQL locally (do not share credentials here if you prefer privacy): mysql -h your_host -P 3306 -u your_user -p'your_password' your_database -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\"\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Tell me you want a local server and specify the schema/tables/data to create (or give SQL to populate). I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the database and data, and then run queries locally. This requires installing packages and starting services.\n\nOption C — Run a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - I can run a broader search for files like .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml, settings files, or other possible secrets across the filesystem. This may take longer and return many results. If you want this, say 'search' and optionally list directories to prioritize.\n\nSecurity note: credentials you paste here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, you can say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the requested details (for Option A include the exact question to answer). I will then produce the next action. I will not run additional shell commands until you confirm.",
