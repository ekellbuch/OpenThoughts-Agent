  "analysis": "The mysql client is now installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is currently no local mysqld server running and no socket at /var/run/mysqld, so I cannot assume a local database is available. To run SQL I need connection details for a MySQL server (host/port or socket, username, and password) and the specific question you want answered. I have not executed any SQL yet and I have no database/schema context.",
  "plan": "I will not execute any SQL until you provide the connection information and the question. Please provide: 1) host (or socket path), 2) port (if non-default), 3) username, 4) password (or indicate you want to be prompted interactively), 5) target database/schema name (if known), and 6) the exact question you want answered (what result you expect). Once you provide that, I will: - Construct a single-line SQL statement (per your instruction) and label the action as 'Operation' so you will execute it and return the output. - Explain why I chose that SQL and what I expect the output to be. - If more follow-up queries are needed, I'll iterate until we can produce the final Answer. Example connection/testing commands you can run locally to verify connectivity (do not include credentials in public logs): mysql -h your_host -P 3306 -u your_user -p -e \"SELECT 1;\" or to run a single query non-interactively: mysql -h your_host -P 3306 -u your_user -p'your_password' your_database -e \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM some_table;\"",
