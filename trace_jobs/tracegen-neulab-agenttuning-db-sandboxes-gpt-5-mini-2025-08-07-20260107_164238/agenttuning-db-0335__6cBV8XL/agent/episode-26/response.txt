  "analysis": "You are in a container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt) and found no client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.). Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a live database: there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or chosen to set up a local server or request a deeper filesystem search. No SQL statements have been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick exactly one of three clear options so I can proceed. Please reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include any requested details for that option. After you reply I will act accordingly.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or \"SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active=1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10\").\n  - What I'll do after you provide these: I will explain the SQL I will run and then output a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (per your rules). You will run that SQL with your mysql client and paste the raw mysql output back; I will parse it and iterate until we produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and say whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe the schema/data) or say 'empty DB'.\n  - What I'll do if you confirm: I will list the exact shell commands I will run (apt-get install mysql-server or mariadb-server, initialize the data directory, start mysqld manually since systemd may not be available, create requested DB/user/data), then run them and report status. Once the local server is running, I can run SQL operations as you request.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (for example: .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml).\n  - What I'll do if you choose this: run a broader find/grep across the specified paths to try to locate any hidden credentials or connection info. This may take longer and return many results.\n\nSecurity note: credentials you paste here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, you can say password='prompt' for Option A and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (A, B, or C) and include any requested details for that option. I will then produce the next action (either shell commands to set up a server or a single-line SQL statement labeled Action: Operation per your rules).",
