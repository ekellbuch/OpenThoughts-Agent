  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I have not executed any SQL statements yet and I have no connection credentials or the specific question you want answered. I am ready to run SQL once you provide the connection details and the question to be answered.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you provide the MySQL connection details and the question. Please provide: 1) host (or socket path), 2) port (if non-default), 3) username, 4) password (or say you want an interactive prompt), 5) database/schema name (if known), and 6) the exact question you want answered (what data or result you need). Once you provide those, I will: - Construct a single-line SQL statement and label the action as 'Operation' per your rules. - Explain my reasoning and what I expect the SQL to return. - You will execute that SQL and return the mysql output to me; I will parse it and either produce further Operation statements or, when finished, produce the final answer as Action: Answer with the exact final values. If you prefer, I can also search the repository for .my.cnf or environment files for credentials before you provide them — tell me if you want me to look. No shell commands will be run until you confirm.",
