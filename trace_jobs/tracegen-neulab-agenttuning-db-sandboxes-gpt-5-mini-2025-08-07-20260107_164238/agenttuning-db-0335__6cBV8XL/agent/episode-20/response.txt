  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and filesystem searches did not reveal any client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.) that would let me connect to an existing database. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or chosen to set up a local server or request a deeper search.",
  "plan": "You must choose exactly one of the following options so I can proceed. Provide any requested details for the chosen option and I will act accordingly.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (preferred if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or \"SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active=1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10\").\n  - After you provide these, I will explain the single-line SQL I will run and then output a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute that SQL with your mysql client and paste the raw mysql output back; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n  - Example client usage (do not post passwords if you prefer privacy): mysql -h your_host -P 3306 -u your_user -p'your_password' your_database -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\"\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and tell me whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe the schema). I will then present the exact shell commands I will run, install and initialize the server, start it (manually, since systemd may not be available), create the requested DB/user/data, and run queries locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml). I will run a broader find/grep across the specified paths and report any candidate files that may contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: Credentials posted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide when I produce the Action: Operation.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that option. I will then proceed and provide the next action.",
