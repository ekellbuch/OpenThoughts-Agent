  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server process running, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and my filesystem searches did not find any client config (.my.cnf) or application files exposing connection credentials. Therefore there is currently no reachable MySQL server and I cannot run any SQL against a real database until you either provide connection details for an existing server or instruct me to install and start a local server or allow a deeper filesystem search for credentials.",
  "plan": "You must pick exactly one of the following options so I can proceed. Tell me which option you want and provide any requested details; I will then run commands or produce the single-line SQL Operation as required.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or \"List top 5 customers by total_order_amount\").\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and output one Action: Operation containing one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to execute with your mysql client. You will paste back the mysql output and I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Tell me to proceed and specify if you want an empty DB or a schema/data to create. I will install and initialize a server, start it (running mysqld in the foreground/background as appropriate), create the requested database/user/data, and then run SQL locally. This modifies the container by installing and starting a DB server.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize. I will run broader find/grep scans to try to locate hidden credentials or connection info. This may take longer.\n\nSecurity note: credentials pasted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (for Option A include the exact question to answer; for Option B state what schema/data to create; for Option C, specify search scope). I will then produce the next Action.",
