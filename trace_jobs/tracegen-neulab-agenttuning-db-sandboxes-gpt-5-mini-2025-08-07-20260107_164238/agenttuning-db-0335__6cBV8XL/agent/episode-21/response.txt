  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and previous filesystem searches did not find any credentials or configuration files (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.) that would let me connect to an existing database. No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection credentials or chosen to set up a local server or request a deeper search.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed without you choosing exactly one of three options. Please reply with one choice (A, B, or C) and include any requested details for that option:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server:\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or the SELECT you expect).\n  - I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) and explain why it answers the question. You will run it with mysql and paste back the raw output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and say whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe schema).\n  - I will list the exact shell commands to install, initialize, and start the server, then run the requested SQL locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (for example: .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml).\n  - I will run broader find/grep scans and report any candidate files that may contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: credentials pasted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, for Option A say password='prompt' and I will give you the SQL to run locally with an interactive prompt.\n\nReply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details so I can proceed.",
