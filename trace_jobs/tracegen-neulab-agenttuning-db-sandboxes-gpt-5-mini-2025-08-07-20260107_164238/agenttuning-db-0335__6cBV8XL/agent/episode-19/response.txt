  "analysis": "You have a container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and my searches did not find any credentials or configuration files (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.) that would let me connect to an existing database. I cannot run any SQL against a live database until you either (A) provide connection details for a remote/other server, (B) permit me to install and start a local database server in this container, or (C) ask me to perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files. You have not yet chosen one of those options.",
  "plan": "I will not make changes to the system without your explicit choice. Please reply with exactly one option (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that option:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server:\n  - Provide: host (or socket), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt'), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\").\n  - I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) and explain why it answers the question. You will run that SQL and paste back the raw mysql output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and say whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - If you confirm, tell me if you want any initial database/user/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe schema). I will then list and run the commands to install, initialize, and start the server, create the requested data, and run queries.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (for example: .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml). I will run a broader find/grep and report any candidate files with potential credentials.\n\nSecurity note: credentials you paste here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, for Option A say password='prompt' and I will provide the SQL for you to run locally with an interactive prompt.\n\nTell me exactly one option (A, B, or C) and include any requested details. After you respond I will proceed and provide the next action.",
