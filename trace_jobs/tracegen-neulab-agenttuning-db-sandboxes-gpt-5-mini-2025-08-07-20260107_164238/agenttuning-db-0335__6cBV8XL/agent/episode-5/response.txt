  "analysis": "Summary of current state: the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server (no mysqld process) and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common places for credentials or configuration: /etc/mysql exists (default configs), there is no /root/.my.cnf, and no MySQL-related environment variables or application config files under /app, /root, or /home that reveal host/user/password/database. In short: I cannot connect to any database right now because no server or credentials were found.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of the following paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — You provide connection details so I can run SQL against an existing server:\n  - Host (or socket path) and port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer an interactive prompt), and the database/schema name (if applicable).\n  - The exact question you want answered (for example: \"List the top 5 customers by total orders\", or \"Count rows in table X\").\n\nOnce you supply that, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, (2) output a single Action: Operation block containing one single-line SQL statement in a code block (per your rules). You will run that statement and paste the MySQL output back to me. I will then parse the output and either ask for another operation or, when finished, produce the final Action: Answer with the exact required answer list.\n\nOption B — You want me to create a local temporary MySQL server in this container (if you want me to prepare a database and/or sample data):\n  - I can install and initialize a local MariaDB/MySQL server, start it, create a database and user, and then run queries locally. This requires me to install packages and start services. If you choose this, tell me what data/schema to create or give sample SQL to populate.\n\nOption C — You prefer I continue searching the filesystem for possible credentials or configuration files (deeper scan). If so, I can run a broader grep/find (this may take longer). Tell me if you want me to proceed with that.\n\nPlease tell me which option you want and, for Option A, provide the connection details and the specific question to answer. For Option B, tell me what schema/data to create. For Option C, say 'search' and I will run the broader scan.",
