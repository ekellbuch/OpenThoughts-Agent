  "analysis": "Current state: the mysql client is installed in the container (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running local mysqld and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. No connection credentials or question have been provided yet. To be able to run SQL I need connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database) or a local MySQL server/socket. A common approach before asking for credentials is to search the filesystem for MySQL client config files or environment files that might contain connection info (e.g., /etc/mysql/my.cnf, ~/.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, or other config files in /app). I haven't yet looked for such files in the filesystem.",
  "plan": "I'll search the system for common MySQL client config files and application environment/config files under /app, /etc, /root, and /home that might contain host/user/password/database info. Specifically: (1) check /etc/mysql/my.cnf and /root/.my.cnf; (2) list /app to see what project files exist; (3) recursively grep for occurrences of the string 'mysql' and also 'MYSQL_' (common env var prefix) in /app, /etc, /root, and /home while excluding pseudo-filesystems to avoid noise. These steps should reveal any stored credentials or connection endpoints so we can construct a mysql client connection and then run the single-line SQL you request.",
