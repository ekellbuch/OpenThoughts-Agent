  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. A prior search of /app, /etc, /root, and /home did not reveal credentials or application config exposing connection details. Because you have not provided connection credentials or chosen to run a local server, the next reasonable step is to perform a broader filesystem search for common configuration files or environment files that might contain MySQL connection info (for example .env, docker-compose.yml, settings files, .my.cnf, config/*.yml, DATABASE_URL, DB_PASSWORD, mysql:// URIs). This may locate credentials or host endpoints so we can connect and run SQL.",
  "plan": "I'll run a focused but broader search for likely config files and common secret names in likely application directories: /app, /var/www, /srv, /etc, /home, /root, /opt. Specifically:\n1) Find files with names that commonly hold credentials (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, *.yml, *.yaml, *.cnf, *.ini) under those directories. This will list candidate files to inspect.\n2) Search the same directories recursively for strings that indicate MySQL connection info: 'mysql', 'mysql://', 'DB_PASSWORD', 'DATABASE_URL', 'password', 'user', and '.my.cnf'. We'll exclude pseudo-filesystems to reduce noise. The grep will print filenames and matching lines so we can locate secrets quickly.\n3) Also search the filesystem for any .my.cnf files (user-level client config files) and check /var/lib/mysql to see if any existing database files are present (indicating a server may have been installed previously).\nI expect to find zero or a few candidate files. If we find connection credentials or a socket, we can then construct a mysql client command and produce the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) you requested. If nothing is found, the next step would be to either (A) have you provide connection details or (B) install and initialize a local database server — tell me which you prefer.",
