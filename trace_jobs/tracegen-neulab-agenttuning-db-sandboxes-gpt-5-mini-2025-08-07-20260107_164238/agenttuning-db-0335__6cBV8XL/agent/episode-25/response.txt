  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt) and found no client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.). No SQL has been executed because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or asked me to set up a local server or run a deeper search.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of three options. Please reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that option:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server:\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting it), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or a specific SELECT requirement).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and output one Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to execute. You will paste back the mysql output and I will parse it and continue until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe the schema).\n  - If you confirm, I will show the exact shell commands to install, initialize, and start the server, then create/populate the DB and run queries locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml).\n  - I will run broader find/grep scans and report any candidate files that might contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: credentials posted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, for Option A say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide.\n\nOnce you reply with exactly one option and any required details, I will proceed with the appropriate commands and the single-line SQL operation when applicable.",
