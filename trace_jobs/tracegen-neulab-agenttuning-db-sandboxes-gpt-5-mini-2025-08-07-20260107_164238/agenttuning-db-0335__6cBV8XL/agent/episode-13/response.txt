  "analysis": "mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and I found no credentials or application config (no .my.cnf, no .env/docker-compose credentials) in /app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv or /opt. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL against a database right now: there is no reachable server and no connection information.",
  "plan": "You must choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of the three options below and provide any requested details; I will then act accordingly.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or specify 'prompt'), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in table orders\" or \"List top 5 customers by total order amount\").\n  - After you provide these, I will explain the single-line SQL I will run and then output an Action: Operation containing exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL code block as you required. You will run that SQL with your mysql client and paste the output back; I will parse it and iterate until we can produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Tell me you want a local server and specify the schema/tables/data to create (or say 'empty DB'). I will install and initialize a server, start it, create the requested schema/data, and then run queries locally. This requires installing and starting server packages and may change the container environment.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - If you want me to continue searching more broadly for possible credentials (including other directories or file patterns), say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize. This can take longer and may return many results.\n\nSecurity note: If you paste credentials here, they will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and I will provide the single-line SQL for you to run locally with a prompt.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (for Option A include the exact question to answer). I will then produce the next Action. I will not run further commands until you confirm.",
