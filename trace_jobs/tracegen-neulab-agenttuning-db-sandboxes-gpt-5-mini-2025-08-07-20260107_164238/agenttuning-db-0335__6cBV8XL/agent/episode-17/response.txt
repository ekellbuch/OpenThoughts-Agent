  "analysis": "The environment has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt) and found no client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.). Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL against a database right now: there is no reachable server and no connection information has been provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick exactly one next action. Tell me which option you want and provide any required details. I will then proceed and provide the precise commands or the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) per your rules.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - You provide: host (or socket path), port (if non-default), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Also provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\").\n  - What I'll do when you choose this: explain the SQL I will run, then output one Action: Operation containing a single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) that you will run with your mysql client. You will paste back the mysql output, and I will parse it and iterate until we can produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - You confirm you want a local server and tell me whether to create an empty DB or to initialize it with a given schema/data (paste SQL or describe schema).\n  - What I'll do when you choose this: I will (1) install the server package, (2) initialize the data directory (using secure or insecure initialization per your instruction), (3) start the server (foreground or background), (4) create a database/user as requested, and (5) run any SQL you ask. I will present the exact shell commands and then run them.\n\nOption C — Continue searching the filesystem for credentials/config files:\n  - You say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (e.g., \".env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml\").\n  - What I'll do when you choose this: run a broader find/grep across the specified paths to try to locate any hidden credentials or connection information. I will present the commands I will run and then run them.\n\nSecurity note: If you provide credentials in the chat they will appear here. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and I will provide SQL for you to run locally with an interactive prompt.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include any requested details for that option. I will then produce the next action.",
