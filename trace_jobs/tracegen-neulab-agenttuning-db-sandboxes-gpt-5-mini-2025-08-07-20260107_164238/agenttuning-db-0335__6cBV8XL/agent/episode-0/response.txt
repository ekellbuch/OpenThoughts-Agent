  "analysis": "I have an interactive shell as root in /app. No prior commands have been run in this session (the terminal is essentially idle). There is no information yet about any MySQL server, connection credentials, database name, or the specific question you want answered. Before I can run SQL against a MySQL server I need connection details (host/port or socket, username, and password) or evidence that a local MySQL server is running and accessible via default socket. I'll probe the environment for MySQL-related environment variables, check for a running mysqld process, inspect the common socket directory, and check if the mysql client is available. Based on those results I will either connect or ask you for credentials/target database and the question you want answered.",
  "plan": "1) Check environment variables for any MYSQL_* or related variables that might contain host/user/password/database. 2) Check for a running mysqld process to see if a local server is available. 3) List /var/run/mysqld (common socket location) to see if a socket exists. 4) Check if the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). Depending on results, I'll ask you for missing connection details or construct a mysql invocation. Each step is a single short command; I expect to get back environment variable lines (if set), process listing (if running), directory listing (if socket present), and the client version output.",
