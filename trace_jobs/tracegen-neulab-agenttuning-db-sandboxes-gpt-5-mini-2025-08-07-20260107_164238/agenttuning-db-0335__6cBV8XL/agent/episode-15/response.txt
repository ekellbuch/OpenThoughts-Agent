  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt) and found no .my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, or other files exposing connection credentials. Therefore there is currently no reachable database and I cannot execute any SQL until you either provide connection details for an existing server or ask me to install and initialize a local server (or permit a deeper filesystem search).",
  "plan": "Please pick exactly one of the following options so I can proceed and provide the next action:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say \"prompt\" to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or \"List id,name from users where active=1\").\n  - If you choose this, I will: (1) explain the single-line SQL I will run and why; (2) output an Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement in a SQL code block (per your required format). You will run that SQL with your mysql client and paste the raw mysql output back; I will parse it and iterate until we can produce the final Action: Answer.\n  - Example client invocation you can run locally (do not post passwords if you prefer privacy): mysql -h your_host -P 3306 -u your_user -p'your_password' your_database -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\"\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Tell me you want a local server and specify the schema/tables/data to create (or say 'empty DB'). I will install and initialize a server, start it, create/populate the requested data, and then run queries locally. This will involve installing and starting server packages and may change the container environment. If you pick this, I will list the commands I will run (apt-get install mariadb-server or mysql-server, initialize, start service, create user/database, and sample populate SQL).\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - If you want me to continue searching more broadly for possible credentials (including other directories or file patterns), say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize. I will run broader find/grep scans (may take longer) to try to locate any hidden credentials or connection info.\n\nSecurity note: credentials pasted in the chat will appear here. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and I will provide the SQL for you to run locally.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (for Option A include the exact question to answer). Once you provide that, I will produce the next Action (either shell commands to set up a server or a single SQL statement labeled Action: Operation per your rules).",
