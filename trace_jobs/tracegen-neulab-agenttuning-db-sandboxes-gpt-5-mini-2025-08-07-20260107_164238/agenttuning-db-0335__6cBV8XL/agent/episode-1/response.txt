In short, there is no local MySQL client or server available to run SQL against. Before I can execute any SQL statements I need a MySQL client present (or you must provide a remote host + credentials so I can connect using a client).",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client so I can connect to a MySQL server when you provide credentials (or to a local server if started later). I'll update apt package lists and install the default-mysql-client package. 2) Verify the mysql client is available by running mysql --version. After that I will wait for you to provide the connection details (host/port/user/password/database) and the SQL question you want answered. Commands: apt-get update, apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, then mysql --version to confirm installation.",
