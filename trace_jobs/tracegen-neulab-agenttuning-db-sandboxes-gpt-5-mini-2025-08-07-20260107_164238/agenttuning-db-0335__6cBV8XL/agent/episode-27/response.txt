  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no MySQL socket at /var/run/mysqld, and previous filesystem searches did not reveal any client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.). Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a live database because there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or asked me to create a local server or perform a deeper search.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one of three options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that option.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server:\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or a precise SELECT specification).\n  - After you provide these I will: explain the SQL I will run and output one Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to execute with your mysql client. You will paste back the mysql output and I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe the schema) or say 'empty DB'.\n  - If you confirm, I will present the exact shell commands I will run, install and initialize the server (starting mysqld manually if needed), create any requested DB/user/data, and then run queries locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (for example: .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml).\n  - I will run a broader find/grep across the specified paths and report any candidate files that may contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: credentials pasted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, for Option A say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option (A, B, or C) and include the needed details. I will then proceed.",
