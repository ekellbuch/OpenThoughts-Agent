  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed and there is no local MySQL server or socket. I previously searched /app, /etc, /root and /home and found no credentials or config exposing a MySQL host/user/password/database. I cannot run any SQL because there is no reachable database and you have not provided connection details or a question to answer.",
  "plan": "You must choose how to proceed. Pick one of these options and give any required details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to be prompted), and database/schema name (if known). Also provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\").\n  - I will then produce one Action: Operation containing a single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) and explain why it answers the question. You will run that SQL and paste the mysql output back to me.\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in the container:\n  - Tell me you want this and provide schema/data to create (or say to create an empty DB). I will install and initialize a server, create the requested schema/data, and then run queries as needed.\n\nOption C — Run a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - If you choose this, I will run broader find/grep across the filesystem (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, config files). It may take longer and return many results.\n\nSecurity note: if you provide credentials here, be aware they will appear in the chat. If you prefer, say 'prompt' for the password and run the mysql client locally using the SQL I provide.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any needed details (for Option A include the exact question to answer). I will then proceed.",
