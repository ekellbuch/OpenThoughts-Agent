  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and I found no client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose, etc.) in common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt). Because there is no reachable server and no connection details, I cannot execute any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick exactly one option and supply any requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to avoid posting the password), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or \"SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active=1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10\").\n  - I will then explain the single-line SQL I will run and output a single Action: Operation block containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in the required SQL code block). You will execute that SQL with mysql and paste the raw mysql output back; I will parse it and continue until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Tell me to create a local server and describe the schema/tables/data to create (or say 'empty DB'). I will install and initialize a server, start it, create/populate the requested data, then run queries locally. (This modifies the container by installing and starting a DB server.)\n\nOption C — Do a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally provide directories or filename patterns to prioritize. I will run broader find/grep scans to try to locate any hidden credentials or connection info.\n\nSecurity note: credentials pasted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I give.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (for Option A include the exact question to answer). I will then proceed and produce the next Action.",
