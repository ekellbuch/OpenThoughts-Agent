  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and previous filesystem searches did not reveal any credentials or configuration files (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.) that would let me connect to an existing server. Because of this, I cannot run any SQL against a database yet. You have not indicated whether you want me to (A) connect to a remote server (and provided credentials), (B) install and initialize a local server inside the container, or (C) continue searching the filesystem more broadly for credentials/config files.",
  "plan": "I will not modify the system without your confirmation. Please choose exactly one of the following options and provide any requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (you provide credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt'), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\").\n  - I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) and explain why it answers your question. You will run it with your mysql client and paste back the output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and tell me whether to initialize the server securely or with an insecure empty root password, and whether to create any initial database/schema/data (paste SQL or describe schema).\n  - If you confirm, I will: (1) install the server package, (2) initialize the data directory, (3) start mysqld manually (since systemd may not be available), (4) create requested DB/user/data, and (5) run queries locally. I will show the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml). I will run broader find/grep scans and report any candidate files that may contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: If you paste credentials here they will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and I will provide SQL for you to run locally with an interactive prompt.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include any required details for that option. Once you respond I will proceed and provide the next commands or the single-line SQL statement as required.",
