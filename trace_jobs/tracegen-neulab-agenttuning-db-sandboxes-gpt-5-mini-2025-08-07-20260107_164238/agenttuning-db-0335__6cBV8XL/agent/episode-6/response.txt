  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed and no local mysqld/server or socket. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home) and found no credentials or application config exposing MySQL connection details. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either provide connection credentials or instruct me to create/start a local database or to perform a deeper filesystem search for hidden credentials.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these you want to do next:\n\n1) Provide connection details (host, port or socket, username, password or \"prompt\", and database) plus the exact question to answer. If you choose this, I will craft a single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) and explain what it does; you will run it and return the mysql output.\n\n2) Ask me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in the container and create/populate a database. If you choose this, tell me the schema/data to create and I will run the necessary install/start and then execute SQL as needed.\n\n3) Ask me to run a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files. If you choose this I will run broader find/grep commands to look for files like .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml, settings files, or other possible secrets.\n\nChoose the option and provide any needed details. I will then proceed. I will not run further commands until you confirm which option to take.",
