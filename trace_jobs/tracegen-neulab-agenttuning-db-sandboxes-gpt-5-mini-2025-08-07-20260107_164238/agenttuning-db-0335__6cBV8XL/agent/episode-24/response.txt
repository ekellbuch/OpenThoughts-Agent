  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no socket at /var/run/mysqld, and previous searches of likely locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt) did not reveal any client config or credentials (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.). Because of that I cannot execute any SQL against a live database: there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection details or chosen to set up a local server or request a deeper filesystem search. No SQL statements have been executed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick exactly one of these options so I can proceed; include any requested details for the chosen option.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (preferred if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to be prompted), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or the precise SELECT you expect).\n  - I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) and explain why it answers the question. You will run that SQL with your mysql client and paste the raw mysql output back; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and tell me whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe the schema/data).\n  - If you confirm, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server (since systemd may not be available), then create/populate the DB and run queries locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (for example: .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml).\n  - I will run broader find/grep scans and report any candidate files that may contain connection info. This may take longer and return many results.\n\nSecurity note: credentials you paste here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, for Option A say password='prompt' and I will give you the SQL to run locally with an interactive prompt.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include any required details for that option. I will then proceed.",
