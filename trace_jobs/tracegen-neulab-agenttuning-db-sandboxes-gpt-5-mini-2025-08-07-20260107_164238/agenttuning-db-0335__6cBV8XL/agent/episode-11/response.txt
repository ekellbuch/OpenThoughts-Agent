  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. I searched common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home) and found no credentials, .my.cnf, or application config exposing connection details. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database right now because there is no reachable server and you have not provided connection credentials or a target question to answer.",
  "plan": "You need to tell me how to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt' to be prompted), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or \"List top 5 customers by total order amount\").\n  - Once you provide those, I will explain the SQL I will run and then produce a single Action: Operation containing one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) as you require. You will execute that SQL with your mysql client and paste the output back; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Create and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Tell me you want a local server and specify the schema/tables/data to create (or say to create an empty DB). I will install, initialize and start the server, create/populate the DB, and then run queries locally. Note: this installs packages and starts services inside the container.\n\nOption C — Run a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - If you want me to look more broadly for files like .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml, or other application settings, say 'search' and optionally list directories to prioritize. This may take longer and return many results.\n\nSecurity note: credentials pasted here will appear in the chat. If you prefer not to share passwords, say password='prompt' and run the mysql client locally with the SQL I provide. Tell me which option you choose and provide any needed details (for Option A include the exact question to answer). I will then proceed.",
