  "analysis": "You are in a container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server process, no MySQL socket at /var/run/mysqld, and my searches across common locations (/app, /etc, /root, /home, /var/www, /srv, /opt) did not reveal any credentials or config files (.my.cnf, .env, docker-compose.yml, etc.) that would let me connect to an existing database. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL against a live database yet. I have not modified the system and no SQL has been run.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one action so I can proceed. Please reply with A, B, or C and include any requested details for that option.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (if you have credentials):\n  - Provide: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or say 'prompt'), and database/schema name (if known).\n  - Provide the exact question or query you want answered (e.g., \"COUNT rows in table orders\" or a precise SELECT clause).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and output one Action: Operation containing exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a SQL code block) for you to execute. You will paste the mysql output back and I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and say whether to initialize securely (prompt for root password) or allow an empty/insecure root password for convenience.\n  - Tell me if you want any initial database/schema/data created (paste SQL or describe schema) or say 'empty DB'.\n  - If you confirm, I will show the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server (no systemd assumed), then create/populate the DB and run queries locally.\n\nOption C — Perform a deeper filesystem search for credentials/config files:\n  - Say 'search' and optionally list directories or filename patterns to prioritize (for example: .env, docker-compose.yml, config/*.yml, *.php, settings.py).\n  - I will run a broader find/grep across the specified paths and report candidate files that may contain connection info.\n\nSecurity note: Credentials pasted into the chat will appear here. If you prefer not to share passwords, for Option A say password='prompt' and I will provide the single-line SQL for you to run locally with an interactive prompt.\n\nI will not run any further commands until you pick exactly one option and provide the required details.",
