  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Earlier diagnostics show: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, no /etc/mysql or /var/lib/mysql directories, and no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. No database question has been provided and no SQL has been executed. Therefore I cannot run any MySQL queries from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed and provide the missing information. Two options:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself:\n- Provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will respond with exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as required: a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block and prefixed with the line 'Action: Operation'. You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and then provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer (using 'Action: Answer').\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client here and provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database). For example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=root password=secret database=mydb.\n- If you permit installation, I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, and then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nPlease reply with:\n1) Your chosen option (A or B).\n2) The exact database question to answer.\n3) If Option B: the connection details and explicit permission to install the client.\n\nAfter you reply I will produce the next action according to your choice. I will not run any further commands until you provide that information.",
