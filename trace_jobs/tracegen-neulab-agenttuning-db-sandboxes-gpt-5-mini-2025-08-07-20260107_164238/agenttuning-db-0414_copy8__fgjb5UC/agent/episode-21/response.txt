No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you'll run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container.

  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose how to run SQL and supply the necessary information. Pick exactly one option and reply with the requested data. After you reply I will follow your rule of producing exactly one SQL statement per round (if operating) formatted as required.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with exactly: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return a single operation per round formatted exactly as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL console output. I will parse it and then provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with exactly: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and the connection details in this exact form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, and then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with exactly: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics to confirm the environment state before you choose A or B.\n\nWhich option do you choose? If Option A, provide the exact question now. If Option B, provide credentials and explicit install permission. If you want checks first, reply 'Check environment.' I will not run any commands until you reply.",
