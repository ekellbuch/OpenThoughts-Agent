  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Previously run checks show: no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. No database question has been provided and you haven't chosen whether you'll run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. No database operations have been performed; the environment cannot access a MySQL server as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you decide how to proceed. Please choose exactly one of the options below and provide the requested information so I can continue. I will then follow your rule of producing exactly one SQL statement per round when operating.\n\nOption A — You run the SQL I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will respond with exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide the next SQL or the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires installing a client and credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and give connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run package installation (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), verify the client, test the connection, then proceed. I will still provide one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) to confirm the environment before you choose A or B.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one of: Option A (and the question), Option B (and credentials + explicit install permission), or Check environment. I will not run any commands until you reply.",
