  "analysis": "You ran environment checks in the container. Results:\n- No mysql client is installed (mysql: command not found).\n- No mysqld server process is running (no mysqld in ps output).\n- No MySQL config or data directories are present (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist).\n- No saved root credentials at /root/.my.cnf.\n- You have not supplied the database question to be answered, nor have you provided any MySQL connection details or given explicit permission to install packages in this container.\n\nWhat has been accomplished: the environment has been inspected and determined insufficient to run MySQL queries from this container as-is. What still needs to be done: you must choose how you want to proceed (you run SQL against your DB, or I install a client here and you provide credentials) and supply the database question (and, if needed, credentials and install permission).",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state until you instruct me. Choose one of the following options and reply accordingly:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself (recommended when you don't want me to install software):\n- Reply: \"Option A\"\n- On the next line, provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL block). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse it and either provide another operation or the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — Let me run SQL from this container (I will need permission to install a client and you must provide connection details):\n- Reply: \"Option B\"\n- On the next line give explicit permission to install a client and provide connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation, I will run the following commands (in order) to prepare and test connectivity, then proceed with the one-statement-per-round SQL workflow:\n  1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client)  -- install a MySQL client\n  2) mysql --version  -- verify client installed\n  3) mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"  -- test connection\n  After a successful test I will run one SQL statement per round as requested.\n\nIf you'd like me to perform another quick environment check first, reply: \"Check environment\" and I will re-run the small diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) before you choose.\n\nTell me which of Option A, Option B, or Check environment you choose and provide the requested information. Once you reply, I will proceed and (if operating) produce a single SQL statement in the exact format you required per round.",
