  "analysis": "You ran environment checks in the container. Results show: no MySQL client is installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process is running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you will run SQL statements I supply or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Nothing has been queried or modified—this environment cannot access a MySQL server as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL here until you choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and reply with the requested information. I will then follow the exact one-SQL-statement-per-round workflow you specified.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will return exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as required (prefixed by the line 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back to me. I will parse it and provide the next SQL or the final answer (Action: Answer).\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires permission to install a client and connection details):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and give connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation, I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), verify the client, test the connection with a simple query, then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report back.\n\nTell me which option you choose and include the requested data (the question for Option A, or credentials + explicit install permission for Option B, or 'Check environment'). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
