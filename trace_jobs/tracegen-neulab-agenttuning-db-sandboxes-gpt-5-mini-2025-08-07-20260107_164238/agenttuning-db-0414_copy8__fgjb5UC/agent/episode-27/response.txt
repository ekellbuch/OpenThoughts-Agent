  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Previous diagnostics (which you ran) show: no MySQL client is installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process is running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf file with credentials. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you will execute SQL I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. No database operations have been performed; this environment cannot access a MySQL server as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose exactly one of the following and supply the requested information so I can continue (I will follow your rule of producing exactly one SQL statement per round when operating):\n\nOption A — You run the SQL I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then respond with a single operation per round, formatted exactly as you required:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and provide the next SQL or the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and give connection details in this exact form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client), verify the client, test the connection with a simple query, and then proceed. I will still present one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report results before you choose A or B.\n\nAfter you reply with one of the three exactly as above and include the requested information, I will proceed with the next action. I will not run any commands until you respond.",
