No database question has been provided and no SQL has been executed. Therefore I cannot query a MySQL server from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "You must choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and reply with the exact required information. After you reply I will produce the next action following your rule of one SQL statement per round.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself:\n- Reply with: \"Option A\" and the exact database question to answer.\n- I will respond with exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Reply with: \"Option B\" and provide explicit permission to install a client plus connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=....\n- If you permit installation, I will run apt-get update and install a MySQL client, test the connection, then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nIf you want me to first run additional environment checks (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld), say so explicitly. Otherwise pick Option A or B and supply the requested data (the question for A, or credentials and install permission for B). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
