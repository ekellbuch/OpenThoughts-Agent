  "analysis": "The container prompt is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Prior diagnostics show there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you'll run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Therefore no database operations have been performed and I cannot query any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose how to run SQL and provide the missing information. Pick exactly one option and reply with the requested information. After you reply I will follow the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule and format every SQL operation exactly as required.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with exactly: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then respond with exactly one SQL statement per round formatted like this:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL console output. I will parse that output and either provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer formatted as:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires installing a client and credentials):\n- Reply with exactly: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a client and the connection details in this exact form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will install a MySQL/MariaDB client here (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, and then proceed. I will still produce exactly one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with exactly: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) to confirm the environment before you choose A or B.\n\nPlease reply with one of: Option A (and the question), Option B (and credentials + explicit install permission), or Check environment. I will not run any commands until you reply.",
