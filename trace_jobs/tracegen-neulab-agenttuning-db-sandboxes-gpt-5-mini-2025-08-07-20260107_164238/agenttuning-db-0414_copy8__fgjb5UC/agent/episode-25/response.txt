No database question has been provided and you haven't indicated whether you'll run SQL statements I give or want me to install a client and run them here. No database operations have been performed and I cannot query any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Please reply with exactly one of the following options and the requested data so I can continue:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide another single SQL or the final answer using:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line give explicit permission to install a MySQL client and provide connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run package installation to add a client, verify it, test the connection, and then proceed. I will still present one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-check environment first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report results before you choose A or B.\n\nReply with your chosen option and the required information. I will not run any commands until you respond.",
