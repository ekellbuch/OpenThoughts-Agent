No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you'll run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container.

Please choose exactly one option and provide the required information so I can continue:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return one SQL operation per round formatted exactly like this:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or the final answer using:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a client and give connection details in this exact form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation, I will install a MySQL/MariaDB client here, test the connection, then proceed to run queries. I will still provide exactly one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) to confirm the environment prior to you choosing A or B.\n\nWhen you reply, I will follow the one-statement-per-round rule and format every SQL exactly as required. If you choose Option A, provide the question now. If Option B, provide credentials and explicit permission to install a client. If you want checks first, reply 'Check environment.'",
