  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Previous diagnostics show no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process, no /etc/mysql or /var/lib/mysql directories, and no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. You have not provided the database question to answer nor chosen whether you will run SQL statements yourself or let me run them from this container. No database operations have been performed so far.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL here until you (A) provide the question and confirm you will execute the SQL statements I give (and paste back raw MySQL output), or (B) permit me to install a MySQL client in this container and provide connection details so I can connect and run queries. Please choose one of these options and supply the required information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself:\n- Provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will respond with exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as required (a single-line SQL code block labeled with 'Action: Operation'). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse the output and then provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer using 'Action: Answer'.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Explicitly permit me to install a client (I will run apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client) and provide connection details: host, port, user, password, database.\n- Once you permit and provide credentials, I will install the client, test the connection, and proceed. I will still follow the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule and show raw outputs.\n\nIf you prefer, I can first run additional small environment checks (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql) before installing anything; say so explicitly. After you reply with your chosen option and required data (the question, and credentials/permission if Option B), I will produce the next action (either the first SQL statement to run if you choose A, or the install/connect commands and then the first SQL if you choose B).",
