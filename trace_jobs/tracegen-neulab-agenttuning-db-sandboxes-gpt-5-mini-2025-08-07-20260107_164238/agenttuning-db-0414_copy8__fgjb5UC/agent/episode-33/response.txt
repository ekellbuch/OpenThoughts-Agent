No database question has been provided and you have not indicated whether you will run SQL I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. No database operations have been performed; the environment cannot access a MySQL server as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed to run or craft SQL until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose exactly one of the following options and supply the requested information.\n\nOption A — You run SQL I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide the next single SQL or the final answer in the exact required format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and the connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), verify it, test the connection with a simple query, then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-check environment first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report results before you choose A or B.\n\nAfter you reply with exactly one of: Option A (and the question), Option B (and credentials + explicit install permission), or Check environment, I will proceed. If you choose Option A, I'll immediately produce the first SQL operation in the required single-line SQL block format. If Option B, I'll install the client and test the connection then produce the first SQL operation.",
