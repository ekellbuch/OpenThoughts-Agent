  "analysis": "The container prompt is idle at /app. Prior checks show there is no MySQL client or server here (mysql command not found, no mysqld process, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql absent, no /root/.my.cnf). You have not supplied the database question to answer, nor chosen whether you'll run SQL I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. No SQL has been executed and nothing further can proceed until you provide one of those choices and any needed details.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you choose how to proceed. Please pick one option and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: \"Option A\" and the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return one operation per round formatted exactly as you required: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block. You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide another single SQL or the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Reply with: \"Option B\", explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client here, and provide connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=....\n- If you permit installation, I will run package installation (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), verify the client, and then connect using the provided credentials. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show the raw output.\n\nIf you prefer, I can first re-run short environment checks before installing (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld). Say so explicitly. After you reply with Option A or B and the associated information, I will produce the next action in the exact format you specified.",
