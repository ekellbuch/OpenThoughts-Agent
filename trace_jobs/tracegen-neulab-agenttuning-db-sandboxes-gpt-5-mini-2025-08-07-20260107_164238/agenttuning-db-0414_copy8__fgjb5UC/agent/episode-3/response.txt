  "analysis": "The shell prompt is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app with no MySQL question or connection details provided. No database operations have been performed. To proceed I need either (A) the question and confirmation that you will run the SQL statements I provide and return raw MySQL output, or (B) MySQL connection details/credentials so I can run queries from this container. Before asking that, it's useful to inspect this environment for a MySQL client, running server, and common config files so we know what resources are available.",
  "plan": "I will run a small set of diagnostic shell commands to determine if a mysql client is present, if a mysqld server process is running, and if common configuration or data directories exist. This will help decide whether I can run SQL from here or if you should run the SQL yourself. Expected results: 'which mysql' or 'mysql --version' will show if a client is installed; 'ps aux | grep mysqld' will show if a server is running; listing /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql and checking /root/.my.cnf may reveal config or credentials. After you see the outputs, tell me the question you want answered and whether you'll execute SQL or provide credentials for me to run them.",
