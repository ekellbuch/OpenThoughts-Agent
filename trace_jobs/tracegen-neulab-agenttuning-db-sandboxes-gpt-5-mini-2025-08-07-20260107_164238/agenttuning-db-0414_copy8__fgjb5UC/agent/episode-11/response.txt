  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Prior checks show no MySQL client installed (mysql command not found), no mysqld server process, and no MySQL config or data directories (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql are absent). There is no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. You have not provided the database question to answer or chosen how SQL should be executed. No database operations have been performed.",
  "plan": "I cannot run queries from this environment as-is. Please choose one of the two options below and reply exactly with the requested information. After you reply I will follow the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule and provide operations in the exact format you required.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: \"Option A\" and the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will respond with exactly one SQL statement per round. Each operation message will be formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and then provide another single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Reply with: \"Option B\" and provide explicit permission to install a client plus connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=....\n- If you permit, I will install a MySQL client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, then proceed to run queries here. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- If you pick Option A, I will assume you will run the SQL and return raw MySQL output. Do not modify the SQL I give. Return the exact console output so I can parse it.\n- If you pick Option B, include explicit permission to install packages. Do NOT send credentials unless you intend them to be used here.\n- When we finish operations and I am confident in the answer, I will provide the final answer using the required pattern:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option (A or B) and the additional required information (the question for A, or credentials and install permission for B).",
