You've already run environment checks showing: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and /root/.my.cnf is absent. No database question has been provided and you have not indicated whether you will run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. As a result, no database operations have been performed and this environment cannot query a MySQL server as-is.",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state until you instruct me. Please choose one of the following and reply with the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL or the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line give explicit permission to install a MySQL client and provide connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run (in sequence):\n  1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client) — install a MySQL client\n  2) mysql --version — verify client\n  3) mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\" — test connection\n  After a successful test I will proceed with the one-statement-per-round SQL workflow.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report back before you choose.\n\nWhen you reply, include the selected option and the additional required information (the question for Option A, or credentials + explicit install permission for Option B, or 'Check environment' for C). I will then proceed and, if operating, produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the exact format you required.",
