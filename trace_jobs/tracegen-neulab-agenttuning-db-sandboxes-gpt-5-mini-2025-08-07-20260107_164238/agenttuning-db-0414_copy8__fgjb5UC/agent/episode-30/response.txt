Please reply with exactly one of the following options and include the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must run only the first SQL code block I provide and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either give another SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and connection details exactly as:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), verify it, test the connection, and then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report results before you choose A or B.\n\nAfter you reply with one of the above (and the required details), I will proceed and produce the next action in the exact format you specified (if operating, a single SQL statement per round). I will not run any commands until you respond.",
