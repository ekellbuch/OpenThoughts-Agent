  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Prior environment checks show no MySQL client is installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process is running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. You have not provided the database question to answer and have not chosen whether you will execute SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Therefore no database operations have been performed and I cannot query any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how we proceed and supply required information. Pick exactly one option and reply accordingly:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with the single line: Option A\n- On the next line, write the exact database question you want answered (for example: \"Find the top 5 customers by revenue\").\n- I will then respond with exactly one SQL statement per round formatted like this:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL console output. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires installation and credentials):\n- Reply with the single line: Option B\n- On the next line, give explicit permission to install a client and provide connection details in this exact form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run package install commands here to add a MySQL client, test the connection, then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nIf you want me to first run more environment checks before choosing, reply: \"Check environment\" and I will run small diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld). Otherwise reply with Option A or Option B and the required information. I will not run any commands until you reply with one of these choices.",
