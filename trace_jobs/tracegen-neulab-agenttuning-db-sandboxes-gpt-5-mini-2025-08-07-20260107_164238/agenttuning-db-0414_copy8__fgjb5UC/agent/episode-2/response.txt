  "plan": "I need the question you want answered about the MySQL database and how you want to run SQL. Choose one of the following and reply: (A) You will run SQL: I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round inside a single-line markdown SQL code block labeled with 'Action: Operation' (you must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output). (B) I should run SQL here: provide MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or indicate that a local mysql client is available and give credentials. Once I have the question and execution method, I will produce one SQL statement per round as required, wait for your returned output, parse it, and either produce the next operation or the final answer. If you want me to inspect the container first (e.g., check for a mysql client or available files), tell me and I will run small shell checks.",
