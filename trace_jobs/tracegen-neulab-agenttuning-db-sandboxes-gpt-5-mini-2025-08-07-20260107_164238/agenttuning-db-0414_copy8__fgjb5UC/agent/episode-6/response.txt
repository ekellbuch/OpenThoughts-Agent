  "analysis": "The container shell is idle at /app. I checked earlier and found: no mysql client installed (mysql command not found), no mysqld process running, no /etc/mysql or /var/lib/mysql directories, and no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. You have not yet supplied the database question to answer, nor indicated whether you will execute SQL I provide or want me to run queries from this container. Therefore no database operations have been performed and I cannot run SQL here without further info or installing a client and receiving connection details.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options and provide the required information so we can proceed.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements yourself:\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what you want to find in the database).\n- I will reply each round with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block and prefixed with 'Action: Operation' as you required. You must execute only the first SQL code block I give and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and then either provide another single SQL statement or the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- You must explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client in the container and provide connection details: host, port, user, password, and database name (or a DSN). Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=root password=secret database=mydb.\n- If you permit installation, I will run apt-get update and install a client (default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), then test the connection and proceed. I will still follow the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule and label operations 'Action: Operation'.\n\nPlease reply with:\n1) Your chosen option (A or B).\n2) The exact database question to answer.\n3) If Option B: the connection details and explicit permission to install a client.\n\nAfter you reply, I will produce the next single action (either the first SQL to run if you choose A, or the install/connect commands then SQL if you choose B). I will not run any further commands until you confirm.",
