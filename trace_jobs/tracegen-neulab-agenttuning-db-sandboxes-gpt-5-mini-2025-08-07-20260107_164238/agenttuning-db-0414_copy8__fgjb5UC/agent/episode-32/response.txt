  "analysis": "The container is at a ready shell prompt (root@969bfacfba21:/app). You already ran environment checks: `which mysql` returned nothing, `mysql --version` returned \"command not found\", no mysqld process is running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and /root/.my.cnf is absent. In short: there is no MySQL client or server and no stored credentials in this environment. You also have not provided the database question to answer nor chosen whether you will run SQL I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Therefore no database queries can be executed from here right now.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose how to proceed. Pick exactly one option and supply the required information; I will then follow your rule of producing exactly one SQL statement per round.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will respond with a single operation per round formatted exactly as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL console output. I will parse it and then provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer using:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run package installation (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), verify the client, test the connection (e.g., `mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"`), then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nIf you want me to re-check the environment before choosing, reply: Check environment and I will re-run the short diagnostics. After you reply with Option A, Option B (with credentials and explicit install permission), or Check environment, I will either emit the first SQL statement (Option A) or perform the install/connect steps then emit the first SQL (Option B).",
