  "analysis": "The container shell is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Previous checks showed: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process, no /etc/mysql or /var/lib/mysql directories, and no /root/.my.cnf credentials. No database question has been provided and no SQL has been executed. Therefore I cannot query any MySQL server from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick how you want to proceed and supply the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself:\n- Provide the exact question you want answered about the database.\n- I will reply with exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as required (a single-line SQL code block, prefixed with 'Action: Operation'). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide the next single SQL or the final answer using 'Action: Answer'.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client here and provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Example: host=1.2.3.4 port=3306 user=root password=secret database=mydb.\n- If you permit, I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), then test the connection and proceed. I will still provide one SQL statement per round and expect you to run only the first SQL code block I give or, if I run it here, I'll show the raw output.\n\nTell me: (1) Choose Option A or B, (2) Provide the exact database question, and (3) If Option B, supply connection details and confirm permission to install the client. I will not run any commands until you reply.",
