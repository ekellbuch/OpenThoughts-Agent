  "analysis": "The shell is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Previous diagnostics (already run) show: no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you'll run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. No SQL has been executed; I cannot query any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of three options so we can proceed. Reply with exactly one of the following and include the requested information:\n\n1) Option A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n   - Reply with: Option A\n   - On the next line provide the exact database question you want answered.\n   - I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as required:\n     Action: Operation\n     ```sql\n     <single-line SQL statement>;\n     ```\n   - You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and continue or give the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\n2) Option B — I run SQL from this container (requires installing a client and credentials):\n   - Reply with: Option B\n   - On the next line provide explicit permission to install a client and connection details in this exact form:\n     host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n   - If you permit, I will install a MySQL client here (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, then proceed. I will still produce one SQL statement per round.\n\n3) Option C — Re-run environment checks first:\n   - Reply with: Check environment\n   - I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) to confirm the environment before you choose A or B.\n\nTell me which option you pick and provide the required information (the question for Option A, or credentials + install permission for Option B, or 'Check environment'). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
