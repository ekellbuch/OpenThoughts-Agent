  "analysis": "I see a shell prompt at root@969bfacfba21:/app with no command output. No MySQL activity has been performed yet. The task description says you'll ask a question and I should help operate a MySQL database by providing one SQL statement per interaction; however, you haven't supplied the actual question or any database connection details yet. Nothing has been accomplished so far; we need the user's question and (if you want me to run SQL here) connection info or an existing MySQL client/credential setup inside this environment.",
  "plan": "I'll ask you to provide the question you want answered and the necessary MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or confirm that a local MySQL server/container is available and which client to use. I'll also explain how I will proceed: each operation round I'll produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block (as required) and label it with 'Action: Operation'. You will run only the first SQL code block I give and return its raw MySQL output; I will parse that output and then decide the next SQL to run or produce the final answer. If you instead want me to run SQL inside this shell, provide credentials or a running mysql client command and confirm permission. No commands will be executed until I have the question and connection details.",
