  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the options below and reply with the requested information: \n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then produce exactly one SQL statement per round, formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I give and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and either produce the next SQL statement or the final answer (Action: Answer / Final Answer: [...]).\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line give explicit permission to install a client and provide connection details exactly in this form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) to install a client, verify it, test the connection with a simple query, then proceed with one SQL statement per round.\n\nOption C — Re-check environment first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run the short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report results.\n\nTell me exactly which option you choose and supply the required information (the database question for Option A, or credentials + explicit install permission for Option B, or 'Check environment'). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
