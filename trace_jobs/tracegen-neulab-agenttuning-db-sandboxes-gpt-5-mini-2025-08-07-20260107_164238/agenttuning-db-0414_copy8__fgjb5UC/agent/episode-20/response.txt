You have not provided the database question to answer and have not selected whether you (A) will run SQL statements I provide or (B) want me to install a client and run queries from this container. No database operations have been performed and I cannot query any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick exactly one option so we can proceed. Reply with one of the following and include the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question to answer.\n- I will then reply with exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as required (a single-line SQL code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide the next single SQL or the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a client and supply connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit, I will install a MySQL/MariaDB client, test the connection, and then proceed. I will still provide one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) to confirm the environment before you choose A or B.\n\nAfter you reply with one of these options and the required information, I will produce the next action in the exact format you requested. I will not run any commands until you choose.",
