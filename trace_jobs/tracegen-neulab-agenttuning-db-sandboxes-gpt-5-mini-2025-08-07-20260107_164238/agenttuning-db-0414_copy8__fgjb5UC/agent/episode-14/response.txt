  "analysis": "The shell is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Previous environment checks show: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. No database question has been provided and no SQL has been executed. Therefore I cannot query any MySQL server from this container as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed and provide missing information. Two clear options:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: \"Option A\" and the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will reply with exactly one SQL statement per round formatted precisely as required: a line reading 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block. You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL console output. I will parse it and then provide another single SQL statement or the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Reply with: \"Option B\", explicitly permit me to install a client here, and provide connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=....\n- If you permit installation, I will install a MySQL client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, then proceed to run queries here. I will still produce one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs. Do not send credentials unless you intend them to be used here.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- I will not run any further shell commands until you choose Option A or B and provide the required data.\n- When you choose Option A, give the exact question to answer. When you choose Option B, give explicit permission to install the client and provide credentials.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option (A or B) and the associated required information so I can produce the next action in the exact format you requested.",
