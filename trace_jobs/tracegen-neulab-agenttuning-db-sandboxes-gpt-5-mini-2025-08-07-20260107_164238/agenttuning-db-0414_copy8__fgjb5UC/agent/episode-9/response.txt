  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose how to run SQL and provide the question. Please pick one option and reply:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will reply each round with exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block prefixed by 'Action: Operation'. You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then provide another single SQL statement or the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client here and provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database).\n- If you permit installation, I will run apt-get update and install a client, then connect and proceed. I will still produce only one SQL statement per round and show raw output.\n\nReply with: (1) your chosen option (A or B), (2) the exact database question, and (3) if Option B, the connection details and explicit permission to install the client. Once you reply, I will produce the next action (either the first SQL to run if Option A, or the install/connect steps then the first SQL if Option B).",
