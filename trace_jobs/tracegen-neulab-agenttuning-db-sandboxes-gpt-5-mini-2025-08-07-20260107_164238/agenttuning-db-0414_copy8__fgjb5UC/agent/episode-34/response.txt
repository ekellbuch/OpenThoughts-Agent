No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you will run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container.

  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you choose how to proceed. Please pick exactly one of the following options and provide the requested information. After you reply I will follow the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule and format operations exactly as you required.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will respond with exactly one SQL statement per round in this format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I give and paste back the raw MySQL console output. I will parse that output and then either give another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires installing a client and credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run (in sequence):\n  1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client)\n  2) mysql --version (verify client installed)\n  3) mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\" (test connection)\n  After a successful test I will proceed with the one-statement-per-round SQL workflow described for Option A.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run the short diagnostics to confirm the environment state before you choose A or B.\n\nNotes/requirements:\n- If you choose Option A, provide the exact question now. I will then send the first SQL statement in the exact single-line markdown SQL block (and label 'Action: Operation').\n- If you choose Option B, include explicit install permission and credentials. Do not send credentials unless you intend them to be used here.\n- I will not run any shell commands or install packages until you reply with one of the options above and the requested details.",
