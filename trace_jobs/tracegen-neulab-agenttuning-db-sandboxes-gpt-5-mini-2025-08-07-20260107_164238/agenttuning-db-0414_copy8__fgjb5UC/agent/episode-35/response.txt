Recent diagnostics show: no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf with credentials. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you (A) will run SQL statements I provide or (B) want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Nothing has been queried or modified — this environment cannot access a MySQL server as-is.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you tell me how to proceed. Please pick exactly one of the following and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as required:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then either provide another single SQL statement or the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires installing a client and credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and the connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run the following steps locally in the container:\n  1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client) — install mysql client\n  2) mysql --version — verify client installed\n  3) mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\" — test connection\n  After a successful test I will proceed with the one-SQL-statement-per-round workflow described for Option A.\n\nOption C — Re-run environment checks first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run quick diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report back so you can decide.\n\nTell me which option you choose and include the requested data (the question for Option A, or credentials + explicit install permission for Option B, or 'Check environment' for C). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
