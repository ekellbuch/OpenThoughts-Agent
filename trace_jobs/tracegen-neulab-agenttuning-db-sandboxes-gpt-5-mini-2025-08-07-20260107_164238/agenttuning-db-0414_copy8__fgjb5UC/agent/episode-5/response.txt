  "analysis": "The container has no MySQL client or server installed and no stored credentials (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, mysql command not found). You have not provided the database question to answer nor indicated whether you will run SQL statements yourself or want me to install a client and run them from this container. No SQL operations have been performed; we cannot query a database from here until you either supply credentials for a reachable MySQL server or allow me to install a client and provide connection details.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and supply the necessary information. Option A (you run SQL): You provide the question and confirm you'll execute SQL I provide. I will respond each round with exactly one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block and prefixed with 'Action: Operation'. You must run only the first SQL code block I give and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and either give another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format. Option B (I run SQL here): You grant permission to install a MySQL client in the container and provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If you permit installation, I will run: 1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client) to install a client; 2) test connection with mysql --version and mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"; 3) then proceed to run one SQL statement per round as above. If you prefer I first inspect the environment further, I can run small checks (which mysql, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql) before installing; tell me which you want. Please reply with: (a) your chosen option (A or B), (b) the exact database question to answer, and (c) if Option B, the connection details and explicit permission to install a client. I will not run further commands until you reply.",
