  "analysis": "The shell is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Prior diagnostics (already run) show: no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql are absent, and no /root/.my.cnf credentials file. You have not yet provided the database question to answer nor chosen whether you (A) will run SQL statements I provide or (B) want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Because of this, no database operations have been performed and I cannot query a MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one of three explicit options so we can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with exactly: Option A\n- On the next line, give the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return one operation per round in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and then produce the next single SQL or the final answer ('Action: Answer').\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires installing a client and credentials):\n- Reply with exactly: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a client and the connection details in this exact form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will install a MySQL/MariaDB client, test the connection, and then proceed. I will still provide one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Run environment checks first:\n- Reply with exactly: Check environment\n- I will re-run small diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) to confirm the environment state before you choose A or B.\n\nTell me which option you pick and provide the requested information (the question for Option A, or credentials+permission for Option B, or request checks with Option C). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
