  "analysis": "The shell is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. From earlier diagnostics: there is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld server process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and /root/.my.cnf is absent. You have not provided the database question to answer, nor chosen whether you'll run SQL statements I provide or want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Therefore no database operations have been performed and I cannot query any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so we can proceed:\n\nOption A — You will run the SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with \"Option A\" and the exact question you want answered about the database. I will then produce exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as required (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL code block). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and either provide another single SQL operation or the final answer (using the 'Action: Answer' format).\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container:\n- Reply with \"Option B\", explicitly permit me to install a MySQL client here, and provide connection details in this exact form: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=....\n- If you permit installation, I will install a client (apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), test the connection, and then proceed, still following the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule.\n\nIf you want an initial environment check before granting permission to install, say so explicitly (I can re-run which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld). Reply with your chosen option and the required information (the question for Option A, or credentials and explicit install permission for Option B). I will not run any commands until you reply.",
