  "analysis": "I inspected the container environment. There is no mysql client or server present: `which mysql` returned nothing, `mysql --version` failed, no mysqld processes are running, and /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist. There is no /root/.my.cnf with saved credentials. In short, I cannot run MySQL queries from this container right now because the client and server are absent and there are no stored credentials. You also have not yet given the actual question you want answered about the database.",
  "plan": "I need two things from you before we can proceed: (1) the question you want answered (the database question), and (2) how you want the SQL executed. Choose one of these options and tell me which you pick:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL yourself: I will provide exactly one SQL statement per round. Each time I operate I will produce a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block labeled with 'Action: Operation' (as you required). You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse the output and either provide another single SQL statement or the final answer in the required 'Action: Answer' format.\n\nOption B — Let me run SQL from this container: grant me permission to install a MySQL client (or mariadb client) and provide the connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If you choose this, I will install a client (apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or mariadb-client), then connect and run the SQL statements you instruct (still obeying the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule). I will only install software if you explicitly allow it.\n\nWhat I will do next depending on your choice:\n- If you choose Option A: tell me the question to answer. I will return my first single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) to run against your MySQL server. You must run it and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n- If you choose Option B: provide credentials (host, port, user, password, database) and permission to install a client. I will then install the client and connect, and then proceed with the same one-statement-per-round process.\n\nPlease reply with your chosen option, the database question, and (if Option B) the connection details and permission to install the client. I will not run any further commands until you reply.",
