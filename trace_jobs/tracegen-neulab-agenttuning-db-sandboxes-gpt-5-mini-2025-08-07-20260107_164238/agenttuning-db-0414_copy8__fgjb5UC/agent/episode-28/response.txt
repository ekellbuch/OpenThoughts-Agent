  "analysis": "The container is idle at root@969bfacfba21:/app. Prior checks show: no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and /root/.my.cnf is absent. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you (A) will run SQL statements I provide or (B) want me to install a client and run queries from this container. Therefore no database operations have been performed and I cannot access any MySQL instance from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose exactly one of the following options and supply the requested information so I can proceed. I will then follow your one-SQL-statement-per-round rule and format every operation exactly as required.\n\nOption A — You will run SQL statements I provide:\n- Reply with: Option A\n- On the next line, provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will return exactly one SQL statement per round formatted as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I provide and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and either provide another single SQL statement or the final answer using:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (requires install + credentials):\n- Reply with: Option B\n- On the next line provide explicit permission to install a MySQL client and provide connection details exactly as: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run package installation to add a client, verify it, test the connection with a simple query, then proceed. I will still present one SQL statement per round and show raw outputs.\n\nOption C — Re-check environment first:\n- Reply with: Check environment\n- I will re-run short diagnostics (which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf) and report results before you choose A or B.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one of: Option A (and the question), Option B (and credentials + explicit install permission), or Check environment. I will not run any commands until you reply.",
