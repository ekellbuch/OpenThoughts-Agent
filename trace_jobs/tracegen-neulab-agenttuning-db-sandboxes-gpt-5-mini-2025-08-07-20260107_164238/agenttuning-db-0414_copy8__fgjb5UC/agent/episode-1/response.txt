  "analysis": "The shell is at a ready prompt (root@969bfacfba21:/app) with no recent commands or MySQL output. You haven't provided the question to be answered or any MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor asked me to run any specific command in this environment. No database operations have been performed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the question you want answered about the MySQL database and either: (A) the MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) so I can craft SQL to run here, or (B) confirm that you'll run the SQL I provide and return the raw MySQL output. Once I have the question and connection method, I'll: 1) produce exactly one SQL statement per round inside a single-line markdown SQL code block and label it 'Action: Operation'. 2) You will run only the first SQL code block I give and return its output. 3) I'll parse the output and either provide another single SQL operation or produce the final answer using the required 'Action: Answer' format. If you want me to inspect the container first (mysql client availability, files), tell me and I will run small shell checks. For now I will not run any commands until you supply the question and how you want me to proceed.",
