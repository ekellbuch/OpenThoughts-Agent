  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container (/app). I previously ran diagnostics: no mysql client is installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, and there is no /root/.my.cnf. No database question has been provided and you have not chosen whether you will execute SQL statements I supply or want me to install a client here and run queries. Therefore nothing has been queried or changed and I cannot access any MySQL server from this environment as-is.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two modes so we can proceed. Provide exactly one of these and the requested details:\n\nOption A — You will run SQL I provide:\n- Reply with the single line: Option A\n- On the next line, provide the exact database question you want answered.\n- I will then return exactly one SQL statement per round formatted precisely as:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  You must execute only the first SQL code block I give and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will parse that output and either provide another single SQL statement or produce the final answer in the required form:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nOption B — I run SQL from this container (I will need permission to install a client and connection details):\n- Reply with the single line: Option B\n- On the next line give explicit permission to install a MySQL client and provide connection details exactly in this form:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=...\n- If you permit installation I will run (and show you each command/output):\n  1) apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client (or mariadb-client) — to install a client\n  2) mysql --version — verify installation\n  3) mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\" — test connection\n  After a successful test I will proceed under the same one-SQL-statement-per-round rule (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block).\n\nIf you want me to re-run the quick environment checks before choosing, reply with: Check environment — I will re-run which mysql, mysql --version, ps aux | grep mysqld, ls -la /etc/mysql, ls -la /var/lib/mysql, cat /root/.my.cnf and report results.\n\nWhich option do you choose? If Option A give the exact question now. If Option B, include explicit install permission and the connection details. If you want re-checks first, reply 'Check environment'.",
