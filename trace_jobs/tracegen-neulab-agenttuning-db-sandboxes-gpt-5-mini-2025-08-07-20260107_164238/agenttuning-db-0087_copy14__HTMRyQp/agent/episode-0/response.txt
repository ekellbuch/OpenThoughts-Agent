  "analysis": "The shell is open as root in /app but no MySQL commands have been run yet. There's no current question from you about the database, so I don't yet know what SQL you want executed. To be able to operate the MySQL server and run SQL when you provide the question, I need to determine whether MySQL/MariaDB is installed and running on this container, and if there are local credentials I can use (for example in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf). I will probe the environment to find the mysql client, server process, data directory, and any local maintenance credentials. After that I will wait for your SQL question and then run exactly one SQL statement per your instructions.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is available and its version (mysql --version). 2) Look for running mysqld/mysql processes (ps aux | grep). 3) List the MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) to see databases. 4) Check /etc/mysql/debian.cnf for possible maintenance credentials (often contains a user/password for connecting as root). 5) Expose any MYSQL-related environment variables. These steps will let me connect and run the SQL you ask for. I will not run any SQL yet; I'm only gathering connection info. Once you provide the SQL question, I'll form one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block as you required.",
