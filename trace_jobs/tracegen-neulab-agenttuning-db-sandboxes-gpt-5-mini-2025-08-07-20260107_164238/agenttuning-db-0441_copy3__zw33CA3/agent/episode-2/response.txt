  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client into the container successfully. Current state:\n- Working directory: /app (empty).\n- No MySQL server detected earlier (no mysqld process, no /etc/mysql or /var/lib/mysql found).\n- mysql client is now available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql Ver 8.0.44).\nNo SQL has been executed yet against any database. To run SQL you must either connect to a remote MySQL server (provide host, port, user, password, database) or we must install and start a local MySQL server (which is heavier and not done yet).",
  "plan": "I will not run further system commands now. Next, you should tell me the SQL question you want answered and provide connection details for the MySQL server you want me to use (host, port (if not 3306), user, password, and database name). Once you provide the question and connection info I will:\n1) Think through and explain the approach and the SQL needed.\n2) If you choose to operate, I will supply exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block, prefixed by the line 'Action: Operation'. You will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) I'll examine the returned output, iterate with further single-statement operations as needed, and when certain, I'll finish with 'Action: Answer' and a Final Answer array.\nNotes on how you can run the provided SQL using the mysql client locally (example template — replace the placeholders):\n- mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\nKeep in mind: I will only provide one SQL statement per operation, in the exact format you requested. Please now provide the database connection details and the question you'd like answered.",
