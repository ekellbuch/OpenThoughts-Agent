  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL queries because you have not provided either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) confirmation to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details. After you provide the choice and the question, I will (1) explain the approach and the SQL needed, and (2) when you ask me to operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format.\n\nPlease choose one option and give the required info:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll be prompted), and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (include table and column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will produce the single SQL statement for you to execute) or just \"Provide SQL\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and a database name (or allow defaults). I will install mysql-server/mariadb-server, initialize it, create users/databases as requested, and then we can run SQL locally. This requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nInteraction notes and rules I will follow once you choose:\n- When you request an operation I will first explain the SQL approach, then output exactly one SQL statement in the exact format you specified: a line with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations as needed.\n- When finished I will respond with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n- For security, avoid pasting passwords into public logs; if you prefer you can omit the password and use -p to be prompted when running mysql locally.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now, reply with one of:\n- \"Operate (remote)\" plus connection details and the question, or\n- \"Provide SQL only\" plus the question and schema info, or\n- \"Install local server\" plus any desired passwords/database names.\n\nI will not run further commands until you pick an option and provide the necessary details.",
