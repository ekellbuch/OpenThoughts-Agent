  "analysis": "The container is at /app and the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). No local MySQL server is running (no mysqld detected earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot query a database yet because you have not provided connection details for an existing MySQL server nor asked me to install and initialize a local server. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "Wait for your decision and details. Provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name.\n- Provide the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Provide SQL only' (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n\nIf you choose Option A and ask me to operate, I will:\n1) Explain the SQL approach (which tables/columns I will use, joins/filters/aggregations required).\n2) Output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate until we reach a final answer and then return 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (heavier):\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed, I will install a server, initialize the data directory, create users/databases as requested, and then we can run SQL locally. This requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nIf you prefer to run commands yourself, tell me and I will provide the exact single-line SQL (and the exact mysql command to run) for you to execute and paste back the raw output.\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting plaintext passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use mysql -p to be prompted when running the client locally.",
