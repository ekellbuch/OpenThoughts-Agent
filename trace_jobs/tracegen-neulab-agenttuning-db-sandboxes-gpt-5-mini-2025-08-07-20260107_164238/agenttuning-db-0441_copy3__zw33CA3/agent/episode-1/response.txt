  "analysis": "Current container /app is almost empty (only . and ..). There is no MySQL server or client present: ps shows no mysqld, which/mysql and mysql --version returned nothing, and there are no /etc/mysql or /var/lib/mysql entries or SQL files in the current tree. Environment variables contain no DB connection info and no listener on 3306. To run SQL statements you will need a MySQL client (unless you want to connect to an external DB). Nothing has been executed yet that performs SQL operations.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client in the container so we can connect to a database when you provide connection details (host, user, password, database) or a SQL file. Steps:\n1) Update apt cache (apt-get update) so package lists are current.\n2) Install a MySQL client; try default-mysql-client, and if that fails install mariadb-client as a fallback. This gives us the mysql CLI.\n3) Verify the mysql client is available and show its version.\nAfter these steps I'll ask you for the DB connection info or the SQL question you want executed. If you already intend to use a remote DB, provide host/user/password and I'll craft the single-line SQL statement for execution as required.",
