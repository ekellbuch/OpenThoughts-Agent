  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), /app is empty (no DB files or SQL dumps), and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot query any database until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific SQL question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required information. Tell me which you want and supply the details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered and, if known, the relevant table and column names or schema.\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or only \"Provide SQL\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). I will then install and initialize a server and create users/databases as requested; this requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to operate from this container, I will (before executing any SQL) explain the approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the exact format you specified: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only the SQL inside that first block and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate with further single-statement operations until we can produce the final answer, then I will output:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting plaintext passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and run mysql with -p to be prompted.",
