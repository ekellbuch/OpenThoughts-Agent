  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process was found earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot perform any SQL queries until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server or (B) ask me to install and initialize a local server in this container. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will not run any system commands now. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered (include table and column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or only \"Provide SQL\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the mysql command you can run locally).\n- Example command template you can use to run a single SQL statement locally (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For security, omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). I will then install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize it, create users/databases as requested, and then we can run SQL locally. This will require multiple commands and more time.\n\nAfter you choose and provide details (and the exact question), I will:\n1) Explain the SQL approach I will use.\n2) If you request an operation, produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate until we can provide a final answer and then return:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use mysql -p when running commands locally.",
