  "analysis": "You are in a container with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process was found earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot perform any SQL operations until you provide either connection details for an existing MySQL server or request that I install and initialize a local server here. You also have not yet provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required information. After you provide the choice and details I will (1) explain the SQL approach I will use, and (2) when you ask me to operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in the first SQL markdown code block). You will execute that single statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate as needed and, when certain, finish with 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n- Option A (recommended): Query an existing/remote MySQL server. Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known). Also tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' (I will output the SQL for you to run) or 'Provide SQL only'.\n- Option B: Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. Confirm and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). This requires more steps and time.\n\nIf you want me to craft the mysql command to run a SQL I give, use this template (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n(For better security omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use -p to be prompted when running mysql locally.",
