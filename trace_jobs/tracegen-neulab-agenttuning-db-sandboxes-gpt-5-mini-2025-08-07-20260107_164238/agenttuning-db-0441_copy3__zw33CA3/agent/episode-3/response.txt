  "analysis": "Current container state: the mysql client has been installed and is available at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process was found earlier), and there are no database files or SQL dumps in /app. No SQL has been executed yet. To run SQL I need connection details for a MySQL server (remote or local).",
  "plan": "I will not execute any SQL yet. I need you to provide:\n- The exact question you want answered (be as specific as possible).\n- MySQL connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306), user, password, and database name. If you prefer, you can run the mysql client locally and paste the raw output of any SQL I provide.\n\nOnce you provide the question and connection info I will:\n1) Explain my analysis and approach to build the SQL needed to answer your question (describe what tables/columns we need to inspect and what joins/filters/aggregations might be required).\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format when you ask me to operate. That statement will be a single-line SQL inside the first SQL code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. You will execute only that statement and return its raw MySQL output to me.\n3) Based on the output you return, I will iterate (if needed) with further single-statement operations until I can produce a definitive final answer. When certain, I will finish with 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [...]' exactly in the format you specified.\n\nNotes and tips for you to run the SQL I give (example usage):\n- To run a SQL statement non-interactively with the mysql client:\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (Replace HOST, PORT, USER, PASSWORD, DATABASE and <SQL statement>.)\n- For better security, omit the password from the command line and let mysql prompt you: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -D DATABASE -p\n- If you prefer I can instead install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container, but that is heavier and may require creating users and setting passwords.\n\nPlease now provide the database connection info and the specific question you want answered (or paste any relevant schema or sample output). After you provide that, tell me whether you want me to operate (run SQL) or only to produce the SQL for you to run.",
