  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process was found earlier) and the working directory /app is empty (no DB files or SQL dumps). No SQL has been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL queries because you have not provided either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) confirmation to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these you want to do and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. Also give the exact question you want answered (include table and column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to: (1) Operate — I will output exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute, or (2) Provide SQL only — I will produce the single-line SQL (and optionally the exact mysql command) for you to run locally.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server inside this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). I will then install and initialize the server and create users/databases as requested; this requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nInteraction notes (how I will proceed once you provide info):\n1) I will explain my approach and the SQL needed to answer your question.\n2) If you request an operation, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations until we can produce the final answer.\n3) When finished I will provide the final answer with the exact format you requested: 'Action: Answer' and 'Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\",...]'.\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and run mysql with -p to be prompted.\n\nPlease now choose Option A or B, provide the connection/setup details and the exact question you want answered, and tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' now or only 'Provide SQL'.",
