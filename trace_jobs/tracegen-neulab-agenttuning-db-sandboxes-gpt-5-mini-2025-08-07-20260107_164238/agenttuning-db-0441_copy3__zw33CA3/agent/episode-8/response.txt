  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process found earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot query any database until you either (A) supply connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database) or (B) ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You have not provided a specific question to answer or chosen an option yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these two main options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question (or schema/table/column names if known).\n- I will explain the SQL approach and then, when you ask me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL code block. You will run that single statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate until we reach the final answer and then produce 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server here:\n- Confirm you want this. I will install a server (mysql-server or mariadb-server), initialize it, create any needed database/user, and then run SQL locally. This is heavier and will take multiple commands; tell me desired root/user password and database name (or allow me to choose defaults).\n\nIf you prefer, you can also run the client locally and paste outputs; if so, tell me which option and provide the connection command you used (or paste the mysql output). If you want me to proceed now with a specific action, reply with one of:\n- \"Operate (remote)\" plus connection details and the SQL question, or\n- \"Install local server\" plus any desired passwords/database names, or\n- \"Provide SQL only\" plus the question and schema info (I will return the single-line SQL you can run).\n\nExamples I may produce when you request an operation:\n- A one-line SQL statement (in the format you require) to be executed via: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nPlease indicate your choice and provide the connection details and the exact question you want answered.",
