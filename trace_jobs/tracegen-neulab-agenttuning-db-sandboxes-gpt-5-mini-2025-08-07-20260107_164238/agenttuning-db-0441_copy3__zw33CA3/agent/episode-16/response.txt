  "analysis": "The container is ready with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), the working directory /app is empty (no DB files or SQL dumps), and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot query any database until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database) or (B) ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Also tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will produce one SQL statement in the exact format you required for you to execute) or just \"Provide SQL only\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command to run).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). I will then install and initialize the server and create any requested users/databases; this requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nNotes on interaction rules I'll follow once you choose:\n- For any operation I perform, I will first explain the approach and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL inside that first block and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate as needed and conclude with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\",...]\n\nIf you want to run SQL locally yourself, use this template to run a single statement I give (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n(For better security omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nPlease now indicate your choice (Option A or B), provide the connection/setup details and the exact question you want answered, and say whether you want me to 'Operate' now or only 'Provide SQL'.",
