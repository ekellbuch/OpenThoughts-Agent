  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), /app is empty (no DB files or SQL dumps), and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL because you have not provided either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server or (B) confirmation to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific SQL question or the schema to query.",
  "plan": "Wait for your instruction. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide (exact values): host (or unix socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or just \"Provide SQL\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n- Example command template you (or I from this container) would use to run a single SQL statement I provide (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For security, prefer omitting -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (heavier):\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed I will install and initialize a server, create requested users/databases, and then run queries locally. This requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nWhen you ask me to operate (Option A with connection details, or Option B after local server is ready) I will:\n1) Explain the SQL approach I'll use to answer your question (which tables/columns, joins, filters, aggregations, etc.).\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations until we reach a final answer, then output:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting plaintext passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use mysql -p to be prompted interactively when running commands locally.",
