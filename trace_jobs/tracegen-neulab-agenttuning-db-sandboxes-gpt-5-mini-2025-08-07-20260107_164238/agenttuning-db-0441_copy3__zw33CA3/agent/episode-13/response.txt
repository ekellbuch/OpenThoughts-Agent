  "analysis": "You are in a container at /app with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process found earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or ask me to install and initialize a local server in this container. You also have not specified the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "Wait for your instruction. You must choose one of the following and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or to \"Provide SQL only\" (I will give the single-line SQL for you to run).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed, I will run the apt-get install and initialization steps and then we can run SQL locally.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to operate from this container, I will (when instructed) produce the single-line SQL in the exact format you requested (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and with SQL in the first SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will iterate until we reach a final answer and then output 'Action: Answer' with Final Answer array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use -p to be prompted when running mysql locally.",
