  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process was found) and the working directory /app is empty (no database files or SQL dumps). No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run or craft usable SQL results until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host/port/user/password/database) and the specific question to answer, or (B) ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (which requires additional installation and configuration).",
  "plan": "Wait for your instruction. Please choose one of the two options and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered (include table and column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or just \"Provide SQL\" (I will return the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n- Example template to run a single SQL statement I give (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For better security omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and a database name (or allow defaults). I will then install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize it, create users/databases as requested, and run queries locally. This requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nOnce you provide the choice and details and the specific question, I will:\n1) Explain the approach and the exact SQL I intend to use.\n2) If you ask me to operate, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and iterate until we reach a final answer. When finished I will produce:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting plaintext passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use mysql -p to be prompted when running the client locally.",
