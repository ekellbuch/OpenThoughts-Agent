  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process found earlier) and the working directory /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot query any database until you either provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database) or ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also haven't provided the specific question you want answered yet.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do, and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered (include relevant table and column names if known).\n- Also say whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output one SQL statement in the exact format you required for you to run) or just \"Provide SQL only\" (I give the SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n- Example command you can use locally to run one SQL statement I give (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For better security omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server inside this container (heavier):\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/password and database name (or allow me to choose defaults). I will then install a server package, initialize the data directory, create user/database as requested, and then we can run SQL locally. This will require multiple commands and more time.\n\nInteraction rules I'll follow once you choose: \n- When you ask me to operate I will first explain the approach and the SQL needed. Then I will output exactly one SQL statement, in this exact format: a line saying 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations until we can produce the final answer. When finished I will reply with:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n- I will not run SQL unless you instruct me to \"Operate\" and provide connection info or set up a local server.\n\nSecurity note: Avoid pasting passwords in public logs if possible. If you prefer, omit the password and use -p to be prompted when running mysql locally.\n\nPlease now choose Option A or B, provide the connection/setup details and the exact question you want answered, and tell me whether to \"Operate\" (I will produce a single SQL statement for you to execute) or to only \"Provide SQL\" for you to run yourself.",
