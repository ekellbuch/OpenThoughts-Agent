  "analysis": "The container is at /app and the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL queries because you have not provided connection details for an existing MySQL server nor have you asked me to install and initialize a local server. You also haven't provided the specific SQL question or the schema to query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the options below and provide the requested details so I can act:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or state you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or only \"Provide SQL\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n- Example mysql command template you can use to run a single SQL statement I give (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For security, prefer omitting -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and a database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed I'll install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize it, create the requested user/database, and then we can run SQL locally. This requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nOnce you provide the choice and details and the specific question, I will:\n1) Explain the SQL approach I will use.\n2) If you request an operation, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL in that first code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate as needed and finish with 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array.",
