  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app in a minimal container. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed. To proceed with any SQL operations I need either: (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server you want to query (host/port/user/password/database) or (B) confirmation to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also need to specify the exact question you want answered or provide schema/table names so I can craft queries.",
  "plan": "I will not change the system until you choose. Please pick one of the two recommended options and provide the requested information. For each option I describe what I'll do and the exact commands/templates I will use.\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered (include known table and column names or paste the schema if available).\n- If you want me to operate from this container, I will: (1) explain the SQL I'll use, and (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the single-line SQL inside the first SQL markdown code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'). You will run that one SQL and paste the raw mysql output back to me.\n- Template to run the SQL I provide locally or from this container:\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For security, omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (heavier):\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or allow me to choose a temporary password) and database name(s) to create. I will then run the necessary installation and initialization steps and create the requested user/database.\n- High-level steps I will perform if you confirm: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mysql-server (or mariadb-server) ; initialize /var/lib/mysql if needed; start the server (in container usage may require running mysqld_safe in foreground); secure the installation or create a non-root user; create the database; then run queries locally with the mysql client.\n\nWhen you ask me to operate (Option A with connection details, or Option B after local server is ready):\n1) I will explain the approach and the specific SQL needed.\n2) I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the format you required:\n   - The line: Action: Operation\n   - Then the single-line SQL inside the first SQL markdown code block.\n   (You will execute only the SQL inside that first code block. I will analyze the returned raw mysql output and iterate until we reach final answers.)\n3) When finished I will commit the final answer with:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting plaintext passwords in public logs. If you prefer not to share passwords here, run the mysql commands locally with -p (so you are prompted) and paste the raw output back for me to analyze.\n\nPlease reply with one of:\n- \"Operate (remote)\" plus connection details and the exact question (I will then explain SQL and output the single SQL operation),\n- \"Provide SQL only\" plus the question and schema/table names (I will return the one-line SQL for you to run), or\n- \"Install local server\" plus any desired passwords/database names (I will perform the installation and then run queries).\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to produce the mysql command I will run from this container, provide the connection info and confirm \"Operate\".",
