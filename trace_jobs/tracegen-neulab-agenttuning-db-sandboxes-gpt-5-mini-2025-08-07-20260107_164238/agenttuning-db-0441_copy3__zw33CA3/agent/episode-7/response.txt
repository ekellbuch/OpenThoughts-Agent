  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). No local MySQL server is running (no mysqld found earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot query any database until you either provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the necessary information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. Also provide the exact question you want answered and, if known, the relevant table and column names.\n- Once you provide that and request 'Operate', I will (1) explain the SQL approach, then (2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside the first SQL code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. You will run that one statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate as needed and finish with 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array.\n- Example you can use locally to run an SQL I give:\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For better security omit the password on the command line and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm if you want this. I will then install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize the data directory, and create users/databases as needed. This is heavier and will take several steps.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the database connection details and the specific question you want answered. Also tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' (produce the SQL for you to execute) or only produce the SQL for you to run yourself. I will then proceed following the interaction rules you specified (one SQL statement per operation, SQL in the first SQL code block).",
