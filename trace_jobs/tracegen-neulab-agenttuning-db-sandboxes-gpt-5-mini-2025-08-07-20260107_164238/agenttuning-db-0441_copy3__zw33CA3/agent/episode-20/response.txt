  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL queries until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database) or (B) instruct me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "Tell me which option you choose and supply the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered. If you know table and column names or can paste a schema, include that.\n- Also state whether you want me to 'Operate' (I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Provide SQL only' (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and a database name (or allow defaults). I will then install and initialize a server and create users/databases as requested; this requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nInteraction steps once you provide the above and request an operation:\n1) I will explain the approach and the SQL needed to answer your question.\n2) If you ask me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) I will analyze the output, iterate with further single-statement operations as necessary, and when certain produce the final answer with:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nExample local command template you can use to run a single SQL statement I give (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n(For security, prefer omitting the password and using -p to be prompted.)\n\nPlease now choose Option A or B, provide the connection/setup details and the exact question you want answered, and tell me whether to 'Operate' now or just 'Provide SQL'.",
