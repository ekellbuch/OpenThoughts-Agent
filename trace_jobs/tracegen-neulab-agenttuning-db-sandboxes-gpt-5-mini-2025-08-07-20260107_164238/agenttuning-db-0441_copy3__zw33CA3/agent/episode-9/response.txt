  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected previously) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL until you either provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not yet provided the specific question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required information. Options and what I'll do for each:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- You provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names if known).\n- I will explain the SQL approach and then, when you ask me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside the first SQL code block preceded by the line 'Action: Operation'. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate as needed and then deliver the final answer with 'Action: Answer' and Final Answer array.\n- Example command template you can use locally to run the SQL I provide (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For better security, omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Tell me if you want this. I will install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize the data directory, set a root/user password or create a user and database as you specify. This requires more steps and will take longer.\n\nOption C — You run the mysql client locally and paste results here:\n- If you prefer to run commands yourself, tell me and I will produce the exact single-line SQL statement (and optionally the exact mysql command) you should run. You will then paste the raw output and I will continue.\n\nPlease choose an option and provide: (1) the exact question you want answered, and (2) connection details if you chose Option A or the desired server setup parameters if you chose Option B. Also tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' now (I will then give the single SQL statement in the required format) or whether you only want the SQL to run yourself.",
