  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier) and /app is empty (no database files or SQL dumps). No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL queries because you have not provided connection details for an existing MySQL server, nor have you asked me to install and initialize a local server here. You also have not given a specific question to answer.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered and, if known, table and column names (or a schema dump). Also tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' (I will produce one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or just 'Provide SQL' (I will give the SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database names (or allow me to pick defaults). I will then install and initialize a server and create the requested users/databases; this requires multiple commands and will take longer.\n\nOnce you provide your choice and the necessary details (and say 'Operate' if you want me to run queries), I will:\n1) Explain my approach and the SQL I intend to use.\n2) If you request an operation, output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement in the first SQL markdown code block. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate until we can produce a definitive final answer and then respond with:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: For passwords, prefer to omit them from command lines and use mysql -p to be prompted. If you choose Option A and prefer me to connect from this container, provide the connection info. If you prefer to run commands yourself, tell me and I will provide the exact single-line SQL (and mysql command) to run.",
