  "analysis": "You are in a container at /app with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL queries against a database until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host/port/user/password/database) or (B) instruct me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You also have not provided the specific question you want answered or any schema/table information.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details. Specifically:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to 'Operate' (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or 'Provide SQL only' (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command for you to run locally).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). I will then install and initialize a server and create users/databases as requested; this requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nInteraction rules I will follow once you choose Option A and request an operation:\n1) I will explain my approach and the SQL needed.\n2) I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a leading line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only that SQL (I will only have the first SQL code block executed) and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) I will analyze the returned output and iterate with further single-statement operations as needed. When certain, I will finish with:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nIf you prefer to run the SQL I provide locally, here is the template to execute a single statement (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n(For security, prefer omitting -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nPlease now: pick Option A or B, provide connection/setup details and the exact question, and say whether to 'Operate' now or just 'Provide SQL'.",
