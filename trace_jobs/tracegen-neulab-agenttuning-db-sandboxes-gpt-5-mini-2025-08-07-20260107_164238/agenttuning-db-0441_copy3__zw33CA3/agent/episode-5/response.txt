  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process was found previously) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL until you either provide connection details for an existing MySQL server or ask me to install and initialize a local server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the needed information:\n\nOption A — Use a remote/existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or tell me you will supply it when prompted), and database name. Also give the exact question you want answered (describe which tables/columns to inspect if known).\n- I will explain the SQL approach, then (if you request operation) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefixed by 'Action: Operation' and with the SQL in a single-line markdown code block). You will run that one statement with the mysql client and return the raw output. I'll iterate until we can produce the final answer.\n\nOption B — Run the mysql client locally from this container to connect to a remote server yourself:\n- I will give the exact one-line mysql command you can paste, for example:\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nOption C — Install and initialize a local MySQL server inside this container (heavier):\n- If you want this, confirm and I will install and initialize a server, create a database/user as needed, and then we can run SQL here. This will take several steps and may require you to accept default passwords or provide one.\n\nNotes on the interaction rules you specified:\n- Every time I operate I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block and prefix that operation with 'Action: Operation'. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. When finished I will present the final answer as: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANS1\", \"ANS2\", ...]\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the database connection details and the precise question you want answered. If you want me to proceed with a specific SQL operation now, say 'Operate' and include the connection info and the question.",
