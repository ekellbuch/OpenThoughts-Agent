If you prefer to run commands yourself, tell me and I'll produce the single-line SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute and return the raw output. If you want me to connect from this container to a remote server, I'll use the mysql client and craft the appropriate command. If you want a local server instead, confirm and I'll install and initialize one (this requires more steps).",
