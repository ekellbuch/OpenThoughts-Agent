  "analysis": "The container is ready and has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL because you have not provided connection details for an existing MySQL server nor asked me to install and initialize a local server. You also have not given the specific SQL question to answer.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice. Please pick one of these options and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or \"Provide SQL only\" (I will give the single-line SQL and optionally the full mysql command you can run locally).\n- Example template you (or I from this container) can use to run a single SQL statement I give (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For security prefer omitting -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (heavier):\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and a database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed I will install and initialize a server and create users/databases as requested. This requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nInteraction details I will follow once you choose Option A and request an operation:\n1) I will explain my approach and which tables/columns or schema elements I will use.\n2) I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) I will analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations as needed. When certain I will finish with:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nPlease now: choose Option A or B, provide the connection/setup details and the precise question you want answered, and tell me whether to 'Operate' now or only 'Provide SQL'. If you prefer, you can run commands locally and paste raw outputs for me to analyze.",
