  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app (root@911de46aa62b:/app#). No commands have been run yet in this session (the terminal shows only the initial prompt and no working output). We don't yet know whether a MySQL server is running in this container, whether the mysql client is available, or where any database files or SQL dump files might be. To answer SQL questions or run statements you will provide, I need to discover the MySQL client/server availability, any configuration, sockets/ports, and any SQL files in the repo.",
  "plan": "I will inspect the current directory and system for MySQL-related binaries, processes, sockets, configuration and database files. Steps and why:\n1) pwd and ls -la to see current location and files.\n2) Check processes for mysqld/mysql to see if a server is running.\n3) Find the mysql client (which mysql) and check its version.\n4) List typical MySQL config and data directories (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql) to see if a server is present.\n5) Dump environment variables that might indicate DB connection info.\n6) Check listening network sockets for port 3306 (MySQL default) to see if server listens on TCP.\n7) Search the repository (current tree) for .sql, .cnf, or SQL dump files that might be relevant.\nThese commands will give the necessary context so that when you ask a specific SQL question, I can craft the exact SQL to run and point to the correct mysql client/connection parameters.",
