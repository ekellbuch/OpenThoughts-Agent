  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld detected earlier) and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. No SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot run any SQL against a database because you have not provided connection details for an existing MySQL server nor asked me to install and initialize a local server. You also have not provided the specific SQL question or schema to be queried.",
  "plan": "I will not run any system commands until you choose how you want to proceed. Please pick one of the following and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll be prompted), and database name.\n- Provide the exact question you want answered and, if available, the relevant table and column names or a schema dump.\n- Tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or just \"Provide SQL\" (I will return the single-line SQL and optionally the exact mysql command you can run locally).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). I will then install and initialize a server and create users/databases as requested; this requires multiple commands and more time.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want me to operate, I will:\n1) Explain my approach and the SQL I will use.\n2) Output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate with further single-statement operations as needed and, when certain, finish with:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nIf you prefer to run SQL locally yourself, use this template to run a single statement I provide (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n(For security, prefer omitting -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nPlease now: choose Option A or B, provide the necessary details and the exact question, and state whether to 'Operate' now or only 'Provide SQL'.",
