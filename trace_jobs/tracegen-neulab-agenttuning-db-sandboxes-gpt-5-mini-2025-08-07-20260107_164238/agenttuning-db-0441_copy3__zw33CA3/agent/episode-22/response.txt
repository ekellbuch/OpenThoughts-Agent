  "analysis": "You are in a container at /app with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld was found earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. To run SQL I need either: (A) connection details for an existing MySQL server (host/port/user/password/database) so I can craft and/or execute queries against it, or (B) confirmation to install and initialize a local MySQL server inside this container (which requires extra installation and configuration). You also haven't provided the specific question you want answered or the schema/table names to query.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these you want and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), database name, and the exact question to answer. If you know table and column names or can paste a schema, include that. Also tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to run) or to only \"Provide SQL\" (I will return the single-line SQL and optionally the full mysql command you can run locally).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed I will install mysql-server (or mariadb-server), initialize it, create a user/database as requested, and then run queries locally. This is heavier and will take multiple commands.\n\nWhen you ask me to operate I will:\n1) Explain my approach and the SQL I intend to run.\n2) Output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block. You must execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n3) I will analyze the returned output and iterate with further single-statement operations as needed, and when certain provide the final answer in the exact format you specified:\n   Action: Answer\n   Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting plaintext passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and run mysql with -p so you are prompted interactively when executing commands locally.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now, reply with one of:\n- \"Operate (remote)\" plus connection details and the question, or\n- \"Provide SQL only\" plus the question and schema info, or\n- \"Install local server\" plus any desired passwords/database names.\n\nIf you choose Option A and prefer to run SQL locally yourself, here is the template you can use to execute a single-line SQL I provide (replace placeholders):\nmysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n(For better security omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)",
