  "analysis": "The container is ready with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process detected earlier), /app contains no database files or SQL dumps, and no SQL statements have been executed in this session. I cannot query any database yet because you haven't provided connection details for an existing MySQL server nor asked me to install and initialize a local server. You also haven't provided the specific SQL question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Please choose one of these options and provide the requested information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing (remote) MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or unix socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), database name, and the exact question you want answered (include table/column names or schema if known).\n- Also tell me whether you want me to \"Operate\" (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute) or only \"Provide SQL\" (I will give the single-line SQL for you to run).\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (heavier):\n- Confirm you want this and provide any desired root/user passwords and database name (or allow defaults). If confirmed I will install and initialize a server and create users/databases as requested; this requires multiple commands and will take longer.\n\nWhen you request an operation I will:\n1) Explain my approach and the SQL I will use.\n2) Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL statement inside the first SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the SQL in that first SQL block and return the raw MySQL output. I will iterate as needed and finish with 'Action: Answer' and the Final Answer array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid pasting passwords in public logs. If you prefer, omit the password and use mysql -p to be prompted when running the client locally.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and supply the connection/setup details and the exact question. If you want me to proceed immediately, say 'Operate' and include the connection details and question.",
