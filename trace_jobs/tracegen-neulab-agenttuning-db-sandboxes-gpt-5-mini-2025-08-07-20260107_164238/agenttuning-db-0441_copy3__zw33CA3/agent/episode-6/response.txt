  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). No local MySQL server is running and /app contains no database files or SQL dumps. So far no SQL statements have been executed. I cannot query any database until you provide connection details for a MySQL server (remote or local) or ask me to install and initialize a local server here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the options below and provide the necessary information. After you provide that and the specific question you want answered, I will (1) explain my approach and the SQL needed, and (2) when you ask me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (prefix 'Action: Operation' then a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute only the SQL in the first code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will iterate until we reach a final answer.\n\nPlease choose one option and provide details:\n\nOption A — Use an existing/remote MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say you will be prompted), and database name. Also provide the exact question you want answered and, if known, the table names and relevant column names.\n- Example to run the SQL I provide locally from this container or your shell (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n  (For better security omit -p'PASSWORD' and use -p to be prompted.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this; it requires more steps (installing server packages, initializing data directory, setting root password or creating a user). I can perform those steps if you request it.\n\nWhen you give the connection info and your question, tell me whether you want me to (1) provide the SQL for you to run, or (2) have me attempt to connect from this container (I will show the mysql command I will run). If you want me to operate now, say 'Operate' and include the connection details and the question. I will then (as required) output one SQL statement in the exact format you specified.\n\nNotes: I will always follow your required interaction pattern: one SQL statement per operation, SQL inside the first SQL code block, prefixed by 'Action: Operation'. When finished I will return the final answer as: Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [\"ANS1\",\"ANS2\",...].",
