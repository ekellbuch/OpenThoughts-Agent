  "analysis": "Current state: you are root in /app inside a container. The MySQL client is installed and functional (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running, no MySQL directories or data under /var/lib/mysql or /etc/mysql, and no database dump files were found in /app. No SQL has been executed because no connection details or question were provided and you have not requested a local server to be started. I cannot access any database until you either provide connection details for a reachable MySQL server or allow me to install and initialize a local server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options. Do NOT run any commands until you reply with one of these:\n\nOption A - Connect to an existing database (preferred if you have one):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (what to query or modify).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name.\n- Optionally state whether you want the password hidden; if so I'll use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf to avoid exposing it on the command line.\n\nAfter you provide Option A details I will:\n1) Explain the SQL I plan to run and why.\n2) Output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will run it and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B - Start a local server in this container:\n- Reply with the single word START-LOCAL.\n\nIf you choose START-LOCAL I will (after confirming with you) install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server (I will show the apt install and initialization commands first), create a user/database or import a dump you provide, and then proceed to run queries per your question, following the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option now: either (A) followed by the question and connection details (and whether to hide the password), or (B) the single word START-LOCAL to install a local server.",
