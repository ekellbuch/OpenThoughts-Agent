There is no MySQL server running locally, no MySQL data/config directories, and no database dumps or SQL files in /app. I have repeatedly requested that you either (A) provide the exact question plus remote MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) reply START-LOCAL to allow installation and initialization of a local MySQL-compatible server, but you have not chosen either option. Because no selection or connection information has been provided, I cannot run any SQL against a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose exactly one option. Please reply in this terminal with one of the following: (A) the exact question you want answered AND the MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If you prefer the password hidden, say so and I'll use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf. OR (B) the single word START-LOCAL to let me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container. I will not install or modify anything unless you explicitly reply START-LOCAL. After you choose: - If you choose A, I will explain the SQL I will run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format (one-line SQL code block) for you to execute. - If you choose B, I will show the install/init commands and then proceed after your confirmation, following the one-SQL-statement-per-round rule.",
