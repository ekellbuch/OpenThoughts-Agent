Once you choose: \n- If you provide connection details and the question, I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (single-line SQL code block). You will run it and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse and iterate until completion. \n- If you choose START-LOCAL, I will show the installation and initialization commands for a local server and then proceed after your confirmation, always running one SQL statement per round as required.",
