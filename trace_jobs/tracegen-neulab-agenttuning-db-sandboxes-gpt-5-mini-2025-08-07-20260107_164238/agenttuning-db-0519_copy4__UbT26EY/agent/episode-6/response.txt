No MySQL server or connection details have been provided yet, and no SQL has been executed against any database. To proceed I need either: (A) the exact question you want answered plus MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) a path to a local DB dump file in the container that I can inspect/import. I will also check the current directory (/app) for any SQL or DB dump files that might allow me to proceed without external connection details.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm current working directory and identity. 2) List files in the current directory to look for possible DB dumps. 3) Search /app (limited depth) for likely database dump files (.sql, .sql.gz, .db, .sqlite). 4) After showing results, ask you to provide the question and/or connection details. If you provide connection details I will explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and then produce the SQL in the required format. If you provide a dump path, I'll propose the SQL to run against an imported DB and then provide the single SQL statement for you to execute. Commands will be non-destructive listing/searching operations.",
