Once you provide those, I will explain the single SQL statement I will run and then produce it in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL block). OR (B) Ask me to start a local MySQL-compatible server inside this container. If you choose that, I will install and initialize a local server (I will show the commands first) and then proceed to create/load a database or run queries as you instruct. For now I will not install or modify anything until you confirm which path you want. Please reply with either: 1) the database question plus connection details, or 2) the word START-LOCAL to have me install a local server and proceed.",
