No choice or additional information has been received yet, so no SQL can be executed.",

If you choose (A) provide: 1) the exact question you want answered, and 2) connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Tell me if you prefer the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or ~/.my.cnf). If you choose (B) reply START-LOCAL and I will (after your confirmation) install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server and then proceed to create/import a database and run queries per your instructions. I will not install or run anything until you explicitly choose. The next command simply prints this prompt in the terminal.",
