Once you supply that, I will: 1) Explain the SQL I intend to run and why. 2) Provide a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block on a single line). 3) You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. 4) I will parse the output, iterate with further single SQL statements if necessary, and when finished produce Action: Answer with the Final Answer array. If you prefer not to expose the password on the command line, tell me and I will use MYSQL_PWD or create a ~/.my.cnf file to avoid showing the password in the process list. If you want me to start a local MySQL server instead, tell me and I will install and initialize one (this requires extra steps).",
