There is no MySQL server running locally, no MySQL data/config directories under /var/lib/mysql or /etc/mysql, and no database dumps or SQL files in /app. You have not supplied the exact question to answer or any remote database connection details, and you have not confirmed START-LOCAL to install a local server.

You must reply (in the terminal) with exactly one of the following options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A (connect to an existing DB):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered AND the MySQL connection details: host (or socket), port, user, password, and database name. Also tell me if you prefer the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide those, I will explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B (start a local DB):\n- Reply with the single word START-LOCAL. If you choose this, I will first show the exact commands I will run to install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server (apt-get update, install mariadb-server or mysql-server, initialize data directory as needed, and start the server), and I will only run them after you confirm. After the server is up I will create/import a database or user as you instruct and then run queries per your question, following the rule of one SQL statement per round.\n\nIf you'd like, list the exact question and connection details now (for Option A), or reply START-LOCAL to install a local server (Option B).",
