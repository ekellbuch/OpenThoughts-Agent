I have repeatedly prompted you to either (A) provide the question plus connection details or (B) reply START-LOCAL to let me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server, but no selection or details have been received. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will ask you one final time to choose exactly one of the two options so we can proceed. Option A: provide the exact question you want answered AND MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Indicate if you want the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or ~/.my.cnf). Option B: reply with START-LOCAL to let me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container. Once you reply with one of these options I will either: (A) explain the SQL I plan to run and then output a single SQL statement in the required Action: Operation format, or (B) show the install/init commands and proceed after your confirmation. I will not install or modify anything until you explicitly choose.",
