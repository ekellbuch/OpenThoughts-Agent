There is no information yet about a MySQL server, client, credentials, or the specific question you want answered. To proceed we need to discover if a MySQL client and/or server is available in this environment and where the database files or socket live, and we also need the actual question you want answered (which table, conditions, or modifications you want to make).",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is installed and its version. 2) Check whether a MySQL/MariaDB server process is running. 3) Check listening sockets for mysql. 4) List common MySQL config and data directories to locate sockets or database files (/etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql). 5) Check environment variables for any MySQL-related credentials. After these checks, I will report back what I found and ask you for the database question and any credentials/connection details. If a server is available and I have credentials, I'll run SQL as you instruct (one statement per operation).",
