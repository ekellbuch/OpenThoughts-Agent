If you prefer not to expose the password on the command line, specify that and I will use the MYSQL_PWD environment variable or create a ~/.my.cnf file. Once you provide those, I will: - Explain the SQL I plan to run and my reasoning. - Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). You will execute that and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate until we reach a final answer, at which point I will output Action: Answer and Final Answer as specified.",
