Without either (A) remote connection details and the question or (B) permission to install and initialize a local server (START-LOCAL), I cannot run any SQL against a database.",

If you prefer not to expose the password on the command line, I will use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf. After you provide details I will explain the SQL I intend to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. (B) Reply with START-LOCAL to have me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container; if you choose that, I will: 1) install a server package (mariadb-server or mysql-server), 2) initialize and start the server, 3) create a database/user or import a dump you provide, and 4) run queries per your question, always providing one SQL statement per round. I will show the exact commands I will run before executing them. For now I will prompt you to choose option A or B.",
