  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed and functional (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally, no database files/dumps in /app, and you have not provided any external database connection details or the specific question to answer. I cannot run any SQL statements until you either (A) provide the exact question plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) ask me to start a local MySQL-compatible server in this container so I can create/import a database and run queries.",
  "plan": "Wait for your choice. You can do one of the following:\n- Provide the exact question you want answered plus MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If you prefer not to expose the password, say so and I will use MYSQL_PWD or create a ~/.my.cnf to avoid showing it on the command line. Once you provide this, I will explain the single SQL statement I will run and then output it in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block).\n- Reply with START-LOCAL to have me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server inside the container. If you choose START-LOCAL, I will: 1) install a server package (mariadb-server or mysql-server) 2) initialize and start the server 3) create a user/database as needed or import a dump you provide 4) run queries per your question. I will show the exact commands before executing them and then proceed step-by-step, issuing one SQL statement per your workflow.\nPlease tell me which option you prefer and, if choosing the remote-connection path, supply the connection details and the exact question to answer.",
