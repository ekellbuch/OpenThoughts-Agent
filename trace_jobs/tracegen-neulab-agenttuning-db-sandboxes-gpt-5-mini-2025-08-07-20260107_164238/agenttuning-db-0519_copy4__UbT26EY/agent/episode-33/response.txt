I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either (A) provide the exact question plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) reply START-LOCAL to allow installation and initialization of a local MySQL-compatible server.

Please reply in this terminal with one of the following: (A) Provide the exact question you want answered AND the MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If you prefer the password hidden, state that and I'll use MYSQL_PWD or a ~/.my.cnf. After you provide A, I will explain the SQL I will run and then output exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute. OR (B) Reply START-LOCAL to have me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container; if you choose that, I will show the install/init commands before running them and proceed only after your confirmation.",
