Indicate if you want the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide these, I will explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format. OR (B) Reply START-LOCAL to have me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container; if you choose that I will show the install/init commands and proceed after your confirmation.
