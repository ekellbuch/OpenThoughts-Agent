  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide: 1) The question you want answered (what to query or modify). 2) MySQL connection details: host (or socket), port, username, password, and database name — or a database dump file path. If you prefer not to expose the password on the command line, tell me and I will use MYSQL_PWD or create a ~/.my.cnf. After you provide those, I will: - Explain the SQL I plan to run and my reasoning. - Provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block on a single line). You will execute that and return the raw MySQL output. I will then parse results and continue iteratively until we can produce the final answer (Action: Answer with Final Answer array) or complete the requested modifications.",
