Provide the two clear options and request the necessary details for each: (A) if you provide the question and connection details, I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute; (B) if you reply START-LOCAL I will show the commands I will run to install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server and proceed after your confirmation. I will not install or modify anything unless you explicitly choose START-LOCAL. After you reply, I will continue with the requested steps.",
