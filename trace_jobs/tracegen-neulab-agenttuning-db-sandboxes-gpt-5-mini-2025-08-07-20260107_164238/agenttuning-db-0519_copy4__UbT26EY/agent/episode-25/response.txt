There is no MySQL server running locally, no MySQL data/config directories present, and there are no database dump files under /app. You have not provided the exact question to answer, nor any remote database connection details (host, port, user, password, database), and you have not confirmed whether you want a local server installed. No SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of two actions. Please reply (in the terminal) with exactly one of the two options below: (A) Provide the exact question you want answered AND the MySQL connection details: host, port, user, password, database. Also tell me if you prefer the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide that, I will explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block). OR (B) Reply START-LOCAL to let me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server inside this container. If you choose START-LOCAL I will (before executing anything) show the exact apt and init commands I will run (install mariadb-server or mysql-server, start the service, secure/init DB) and ask for your confirmation; afterwards I will create/import any database you provide and run queries per your question using the one-SQL-per-round workflow. Reply with only your chosen option and the required information so I can proceed.",
