Also tell me if you prefer the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide these, I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block). OR (B) Reply START-LOCAL to have me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container; if you choose that I will show the install/init commands before running them and proceed only after your confirmation.",
