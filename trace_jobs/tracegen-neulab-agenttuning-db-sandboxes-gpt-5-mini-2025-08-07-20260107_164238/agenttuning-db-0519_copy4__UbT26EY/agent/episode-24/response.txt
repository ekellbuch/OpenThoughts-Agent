  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally, no database files or dumps in /app, and you have not provided the exact question to answer or any MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I have repeatedly prompted you to either (A) provide the question plus connection details or (B) reply START-LOCAL to let me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server, but no selection or details have been received. No SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "Wait for your explicit choice. Reply with exactly one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n(A) Provide the exact question you want answered AND MySQL connection details: host, port, user, password, database. Indicate if you want the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide these, I will explain the single SQL statement I plan to run and then output it in the required format (Action: Operation) as a one-line SQL block.\n\n(B) Reply START-LOCAL to have me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container. If you choose this, I will show the install/initialization commands before running them and then proceed to create/import a database and run queries per your question (one SQL statement per round).\n\nI will not take further action until you reply with one of the two options above.",
