Multiple prompts have been printed asking you to either (A) provide the question plus connection details or (B) reply START-LOCAL to install a local server, but no choice has been received. At this point I cannot run any SQL until you pick one of those options or provide a DB dump or connection info.",

After you reply I will either: (A) explain the SQL I plan to run and then output exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) show the install/init commands for a local server and proceed after your confirmation. I will not perform installs or run SQL until you explicitly choose.",
