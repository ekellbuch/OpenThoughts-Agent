There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally, there are no MySQL data/config directories present, and no database dump files were found in /app. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any remote database connection details, and you have not confirmed whether you want a local server installed. Because of that, no SQL has been executed and I cannot access a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will prompt you one more time to choose exactly one of the two available paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption A (connect to an existing DB): You must provide the exact question you want answered AND the MySQL connection details: host (or socket), port, user, password, and database name. Also tell me if you prefer the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide these I will: 1) explain the single SQL statement I will run and why, and 2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B (start a local DB): Reply with the single word START-LOCAL. If you choose this I will: 1) show the exact apt install and initialization commands I will run to install and start a local MySQL-compatible server, 2) run them only after you confirm, and 3) create/import a database (if you provide a dump) and run queries per your question. I will always provide one SQL statement per round.\n\nPlease reply in the terminal with exactly one option (A with details, or START-LOCAL).",
