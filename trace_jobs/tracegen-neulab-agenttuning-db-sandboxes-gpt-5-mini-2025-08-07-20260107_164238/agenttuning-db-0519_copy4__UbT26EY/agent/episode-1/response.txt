  "analysis": "Current environment has no MySQL client or server present. The mysql binary is missing, no mysqld process is running, common MySQL directories (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql) are absent, and there are no MySQL-related environment variables. To run SQL against a MySQL server from this container we need a MySQL client or another way to connect to a database. At this point no database server is available locally. The next step is to install a MySQL/MariaDB client so we can connect to a database when you provide connection details (host, port, user, password) or to a locally started server if one is available later.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL-compatible client (default-mysql-client) non-interactively. 3) Verify the mysql client installation by printing its version. After the client is available, I'll ask you for the database connection details or the specific question and credentials so I can run the single SQL statement you request. If apt/network is unavailable, we'll see errors and then choose an alternative plan.",
