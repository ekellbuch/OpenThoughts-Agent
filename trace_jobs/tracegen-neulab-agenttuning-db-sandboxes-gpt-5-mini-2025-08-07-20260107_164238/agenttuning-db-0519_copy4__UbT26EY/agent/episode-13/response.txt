There is no MySQL server running locally, no database files or dumps in /app, and you have not provided any external MySQL connection details or the exact question to answer. I cannot run any SQL until you either (A) provide the exact question plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) reply with START-LOCAL to let me install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server in this container.",
  "plan": "Wait for your choice. If you provide connection details and the exact question I will: 1) explain the SQL I plan to run, 2) output a single SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (one-line SQL in a code block), and 3) parse the output you return and iterate until completion. If you reply START-LOCAL I will: 1) show the commands I will use to install and initialize a local MySQL-compatible server (mariadb-server or mysql-server), 2) run those installation commands, 3) create or import a database if you provide a dump, and 4) run queries per your instructions — always providing one SQL statement per round. If you prefer not to expose a password on the command line, tell me and I will use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf to keep it hidden.",
