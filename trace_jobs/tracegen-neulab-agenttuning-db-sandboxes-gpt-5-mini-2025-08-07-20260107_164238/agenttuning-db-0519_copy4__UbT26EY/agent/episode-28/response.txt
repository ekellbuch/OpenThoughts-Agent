There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running locally, no MySQL data/config directories under /var/lib/mysql or /etc/mysql, and no database dumps or files were found in /app. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any remote DB connection details, and you have not confirmed whether you want a local server installed. Therefore no SQL has been executed and I cannot query any database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A (connect to an existing DB):\n- You provide the exact question to answer and MySQL connection details: host (or socket), port, user, password, and database name. Tell me if you prefer the password hidden (I can use MYSQL_PWD or create ~/.my.cnf). After you provide these I will: 1) explain the single SQL statement I intend to run and why, and 2) output exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B (start a local DB):\n- Reply with the single word START-LOCAL. After that confirmation I will: 1) show the exact apt install and initialization commands I will run to install and start a local MySQL-compatible server (mariadb-server or mysql-server), 2) run them only after you confirm, 3) create/import a database if you provide a dump, and 4) run queries per your question, always providing one SQL statement per round.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one option now: either (A) followed by the question and connection details (and whether to hide the password), or (B) the word START-LOCAL.",
