The next step is to try to connect to a local MySQL server (or the default socket) and list available databases. If there's no server running or socket access is denied, the mysql client will report an error and we'll adapt (for example by checking for running mysqld processes, looking for configuration, or asking you for connection credentials/host).",
  "plan": "Run the mysql client to issue a simple non-interactive statement that lists databases: SHOW DATABASES;. This will reveal whether a local MySQL server is running and accessible and what databases exist. Depending on the output, we'll either proceed to query a specific database/table you ask about, or troubleshoot connection availability (check mysqld process and sockets or ask for host/credentials).",
