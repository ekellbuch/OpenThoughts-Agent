Nothing has been attempted yet to connect to MySQL from this shell. To proceed I need to inspect the MySQL server (if present) and see available databases/tables so I can answer your future SQL question. I will try to connect to the local MySQL client and list databases. If the mysql client isn't available or authentication fails, I'll report that output so we can adapt.",

This will tell us whether MySQL client is installed and whether we can connect to a local server as root without a password. If successful, we'll see available databases and decide the next SQL to run based on your question. Command: run mysql with -e 'SHOW DATABASES;' so it returns quickly in the terminal.",
