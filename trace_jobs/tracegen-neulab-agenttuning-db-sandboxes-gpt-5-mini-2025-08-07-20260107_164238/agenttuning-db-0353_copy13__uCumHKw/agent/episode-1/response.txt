  "analysis": "The mysql client is not installed in the container (mysql: command not found). No MySQL server or databases have been inspected yet. To run SQL against a MySQL server we need a client. Next step is to install a MySQL client (or MariaDB client) so we can connect to any available server. If there's no network or package manager, we'll see the failure output and adapt. After installing a client, we'll attempt to connect or list servers/databases as requested.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists with apt-get update so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client). 3) If installation succeeds, try listing databases with the mysql client: mysql --batch --skip-column-names -e 'SHOW DATABASES;'.\n\nI expect apt-get update to fetch package metadata, apt-get install to install the client, and then the mysql command to either list databases (if a server is available and allows connection) or report connection/authentication errors which we will handle next.",
