  "analysis": "You are in a container shell as root in /app. No previous commands have been run in this session. There's no visible MySQL activity yet. The task workflow requires interacting with a MySQL server using single SQL statements per operation. Before issuing SQL, we need to confirm whether a MySQL server is reachable and whether a MySQL client is available. What has been accomplished: nothing yet. What still needs to be done: discover whether the mysql client is present and can connect, and, if so, run SQL statements as you request.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see if there are database-related files or credentials. 2) Attempt to connect to MySQL using the mysql client and run a SHOW DATABASES; statement to determine available databases. If that succeeds, I'll wait for your question and then run the specific SQL you request. If it fails, I'll report the error output so we can troubleshoot credentials or server availability. The first command is quick (ls), the second may take a bit (mysql client connection).",
