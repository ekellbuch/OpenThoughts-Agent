I cannot run any SQL because I have no target database to connect to. You also haven't provided the database question you want answered (what table/columns/conditions/aggregation you need).",
  "plan": "I will not run any operations until you tell me which database to target or whether you want a local server created. Please choose one of the following and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"List all users with last_login in the past 30 days\" or \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\").\n  - I will then craft one single-line SQL statement and present it as: Action: Operation with a single SQL code block (this will be the only SQL executed by you). After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will analyze and continue or finish.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL server here:\n  - If you want a local server, confirm and I will install and initialize MySQL/MariaDB, start it, create a database and user, and then proceed to answer your question against that local DB. Note this takes more time and will be done inside this container.\n\nIf you choose Option A, here is an example mysql client command you can run locally (replace placeholders) to execute the SQL I will provide:\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nPlease tell me which option you want and supply the connection details and the specific question you want answered.",
