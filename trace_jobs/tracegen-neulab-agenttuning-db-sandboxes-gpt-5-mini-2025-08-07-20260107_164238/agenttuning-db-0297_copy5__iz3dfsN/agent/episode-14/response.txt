  "analysis": "The environment: mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening port 3306). You have not provided a database question or any connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Because there's no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet. I have prepared the client so we're ready to connect when you provide connection info or confirm installing a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide required details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (what table/columns/conditions/aggregation/limits etc.).\n  - I will then produce exactly one SQL statement (one line) in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing that one-line SQL statement; you will execute it and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze results and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n  - If you prefer not to paste credentials here, tell me and I will give you the mysql client command to run locally with the SQL I produce.\n\nOption B — Install and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB and any desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow me to generate defaults).\n  - I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the DB/user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question.\n\nWhen you provide the connection details and the precise question, I will: 1) explain my reasoning and show the single SQL statement to run (Action: Operation). 2) After you run it and paste the raw output, I will continue or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nHelpful examples of the exact question format you can send me:\n  - \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'.\"\n  - \"List id, name, email from users created in the last 30 days.\" \n  - \"Show top 5 products by total_sales for year 2025 (product_id, total_sales).\"\n\nSecurity note: If you paste credentials here they will be visible in the session. If you prefer privacy, ask me to provide the SQL plus the exact mysql client command and run it locally instead.",
