  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor the specific question you want answered. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (e.g., \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\" or \"List users created in the last 30 days\").\n  - I will then produce a single-line SQL statement in the exact required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will run that one statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze it and continue or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server (MySQL or MariaDB) and provide any desired root password, database name, and user credentials.\n  - If confirmed, I will install and start the server, create the database/user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the required details (for Option A) or confirm installation details (for Option B). If you choose Option A and prefer not to share credentials here, I can instead produce the single SQL statement and the exact mysql client command you can run locally.",
