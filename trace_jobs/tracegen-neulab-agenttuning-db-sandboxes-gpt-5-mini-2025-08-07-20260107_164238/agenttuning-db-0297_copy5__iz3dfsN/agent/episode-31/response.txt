  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not supplied any remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot run any SQL statements yet. Previous steps already installed the mysql client and confirmed it's available.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will execute that single SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list and run the installation and initialization commands to install and start the server and to create the DB/user. After the server is available I will proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A and ask me to only produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command so you can run it locally and paste back the raw output.\n\nPlease reply with either: (A) connection details + precise question, or (B) confirmation to install a local server and any desired credentials. Once you reply I will explain my SQL approach and then produce the single SQL operation (Action: Operation) as required.",
