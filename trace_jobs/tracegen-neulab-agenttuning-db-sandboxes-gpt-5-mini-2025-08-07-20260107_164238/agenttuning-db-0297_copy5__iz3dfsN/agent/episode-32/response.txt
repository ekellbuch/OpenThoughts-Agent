  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor specified the database question you want answered. Because there is no target server or credentials, no SQL can be executed yet. The container is prepared to connect once you provide connection info or confirm that you want a local server created here.",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state without your instruction. Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute that single SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and indicate whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server and to create the DB and user, then proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials here, choose Option A and ask me to produce only the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. When you reply, include your choice and the required details (for A: connection + question; for B: confirm install and any credentials or say use defaults).",
