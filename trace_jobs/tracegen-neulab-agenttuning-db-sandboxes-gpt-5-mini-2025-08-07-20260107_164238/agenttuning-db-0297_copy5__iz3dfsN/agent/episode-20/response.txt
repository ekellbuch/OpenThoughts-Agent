  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The mysql client has been installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor the specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, no SQL can be executed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the required information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (clearly specify tables, columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - Once you provide those, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format:\n\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n\n    You will run only that SQL (I will expect you to execute the first SQL code block). After you paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\n  - If you prefer not to paste credentials here, I can provide the single-line SQL and the exact mysql client command you can run locally (example: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, a database name and a user/password to create (or allow me to choose defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will run package installation and initialization commands to install and start the server, create the database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nNext step: tell me Option A or B. If A, provide connection details and the exact question to answer. If B, confirm installation and provide any desired credentials or let me pick defaults.",
