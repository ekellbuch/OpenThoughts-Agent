  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening 3306). You have not provided any remote connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server to connect to, I cannot run any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following and provide the required information: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact data question you want answered (examples below). \n  - Once you provide those, I will craft exactly one single-line SQL statement and present it in the required format: \n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n    You will execute only that SQL (I will only expect the first SQL code block to be run). Then paste the raw MySQL output back and I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - If you confirm, I will install and initialize a local MySQL (or MariaDB) server, start it, create a database and user, and then proceed. This takes more time and changes the container.\n\nHelpful notes and examples of questions you can ask me to turn into SQL:\n  - \"List all users where last_login is within the last 30 days.\" \n  - \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'.\" \n  - \"Show the top 5 products by total_sales for 2025.\" \n\nIf you choose Option A, here is how you (or I) will run the SQL I produce with the mysql client (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nSecurity reminder: if you paste connection info here, consider using a redacted password in public contexts. Provide credentials only if you intend them to be used in this session.\n\nTell me which option you want and, if Option A, provide the connection details plus the exact question to answer.",
