  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor the specific database question you want answered. Therefore I cannot run any SQL statements yet because there is no target server to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\" or \"List users created in the last 30 days\").\n  - I will then craft exactly one single-line SQL statement and present it in the required format:\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n    You will execute only that SQL (I will expect you to run the first SQL code block). After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this. If confirmed, specify whether to install MySQL or MariaDB and optionally provide preferred root password, database name, and user credentials.\n  - I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question.\n\nIf you choose Option A and prefer not to share credentials here, I can supply the single-line SQL and the exact mysql client command you can run locally (example: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide the required details and the precise question you want answered. Once you provide that, I will produce the single SQL operation in the required format.",
