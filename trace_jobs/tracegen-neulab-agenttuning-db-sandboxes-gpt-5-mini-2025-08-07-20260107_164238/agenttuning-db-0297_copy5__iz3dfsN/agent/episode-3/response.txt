  "analysis": "mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening 3306). I cannot run any SQL yet because I have no server connection details. The environment is ready to connect to a remote DB using the mysql client once you provide host, port (default 3306), username, password, and database name. You also haven't provided the specific question you want answered from the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide either: A) the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the exact question (what table/columns/conditions/aggregation you want), or B) confirmation that you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server here (in which case I'll install, start, create a test DB/user, and then proceed). Once you provide the connection details and the question, I will: 1) craft a single-line SQL statement that answers the question and present it in the exact required format: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block (one statement, one line). 2) You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 3) I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array. Please tell me which option you prefer and provide the needed details.",
