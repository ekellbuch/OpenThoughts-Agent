  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm creating a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format:\n\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n\n    You will run only that SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install and initialize the server, start it, create the DB and user, and then proceed to answer your question.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A and ask me to only produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. Provide your choice (A or B) and the required details (for A: connection + question; for B: confirm install and any credentials), and I will proceed.",
