  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute SQL statements against any database yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm that you want a local server created here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information. Do not run any commands yet unless you instruct me to.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (clearly specify tables/columns/filters/aggregations/sorting/limits).\n  - After you provide those, I will explain my approach and produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single one-line SQL code block). You will run that one SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or let me choose defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the database and user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question. I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A but ask me only to produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here.\n\nWhen you reply, state your choice (A or B) and provide the necessary details and the exact question to answer. After that I will (1) explain my SQL reasoning and (2) produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) as required.",
