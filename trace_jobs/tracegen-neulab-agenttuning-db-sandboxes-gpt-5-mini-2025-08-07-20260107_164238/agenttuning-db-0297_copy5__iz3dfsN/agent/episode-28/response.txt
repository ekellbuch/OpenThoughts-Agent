  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm creating a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further commands until you choose one of two options: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (clearly specify tables, columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\n  - After you provide those, I will explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format:\n\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n\n    You will execute only that SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and indicate preference (MySQL or MariaDB). Optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install and initialize the server, start it, create the DB and user, and then proceed to answer your question.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials here, choose Option A and tell me to only produce the SQL plus the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output back here. When you reply, include your choice and the required details (or confirm local install).",
