  "analysis": "Current environment: mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet. The container is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm installing a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information. Option A — Connect to an existing database (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (specify tables, columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit). After you provide those, I will explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer. Option B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB, and optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and user/password to create (or allow defaults). If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server and to create the DB/user, then proceed. If you prefer not to share credentials here, choose Option A and ask me to provide only the SQL plus the exact mysql client command so you can run it locally and paste the raw output. Please state \"Option A\" with connection details + precise question, or \"Option B\" with confirmation and optional credentials.",
