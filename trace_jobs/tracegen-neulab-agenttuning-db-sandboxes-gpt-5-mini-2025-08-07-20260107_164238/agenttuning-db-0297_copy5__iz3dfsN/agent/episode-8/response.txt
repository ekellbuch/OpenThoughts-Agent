  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening port 3306), and you have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor the specific question you want answered. Because there is no target database to connect to, I cannot issue any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the following and provide the requested information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide the connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"List users created in the last 30 days\", or \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\").\n  - After you provide those, I will craft exactly one single-line SQL statement (formatted per your required workflow) as: \n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n    You will execute that single SQL statement and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze the result and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this. If confirmed, specify whether to use MySQL or MariaDB and any preferred root password / database name / user credentials.\n  - I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question.\n\nSecurity note: If you paste credentials here, be aware they will appear in this session. If you prefer not to reveal the password publicly, you can run the mysql client command locally using the SQL I provide. Example command you can run when I supply SQL (replace placeholders):\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the exact question you want answered. I will then produce the single SQL operation in the required format.",
