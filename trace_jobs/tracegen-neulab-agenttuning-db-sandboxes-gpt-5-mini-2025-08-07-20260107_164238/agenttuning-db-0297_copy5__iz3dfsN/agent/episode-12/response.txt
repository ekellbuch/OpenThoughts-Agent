  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor the specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\", or \"List users created in the last 30 days\").\n  - Once you provide those, I will craft exactly one single-line SQL statement and present it in the required format: \n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n    You will execute only that SQL (I will expect you to run the SQL in the first SQL code block). After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will analyze the output and either issue the next single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this. If confirmed, tell me whether to install MySQL or MariaDB and provide any desired root password, database name, and user credentials (or I can generate defaults).\n  - I will install, initialize, and start the server, create the database and user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question.\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials here, I can produce the single-line SQL and the exact mysql client command you can run on your side (mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\") and you can paste back the raw output. Please tell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the precise question you want answered.",
