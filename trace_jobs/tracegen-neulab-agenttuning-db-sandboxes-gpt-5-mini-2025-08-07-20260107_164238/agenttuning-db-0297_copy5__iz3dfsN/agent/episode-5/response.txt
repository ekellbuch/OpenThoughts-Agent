  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no running MySQL server locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening 3306) and you have not provided any remote database connection details or a database question to answer. I cannot execute any SQL yet because I have no server to connect to and you haven't supplied the question or credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these two paths and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306), username, password, database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"List users created in the last 30 days\", or \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\").\n  - I will then craft a single-line SQL statement and present it in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will run that single statement and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and continue or finish.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this. If confirmed, I'll install and initialize a local server (or MariaDB) and create a database and user. After that I'll proceed to run SQL as requested.\n\nIf you choose Option A, I can also show the exact mysql command to run the SQL I provide, e.g.: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\". Provide the connection details and the question you want answered and I will prepare the single SQL operation per your workflow.",
