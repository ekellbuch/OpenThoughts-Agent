  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot run any SQL statements against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state without your instruction. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - Once provided, I will explain the SQL I will run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format:\n\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n\n    You will execute only that SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server and to create the DB and user. After the server is available I will proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A but tell me to only produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. Examples of precise questions you can give: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\", \"List id, name, email from users created in the last 30 days, ordered by created_at desc, limit 50\", or \"Show top 5 products by total_sales in 2025 (product_id, total_sales)\".\n\nWhen you reply, state your choice (Option A or B) and provide the required details (for A: connection + question; for B: confirm installation and any desired credentials). I will then (1) explain my SQL approach and (2) produce the single SQL operation in the exact required format.",
