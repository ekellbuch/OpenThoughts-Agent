  "analysis": "Current state: the container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor the specific database question you want answered. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot run SQL yet. I have been following your workflow requirements: when I operate I must provide exactly one SQL statement in a single SQL code block (Action: Operation). I must also explain my thoughts and plan before operating. Right now the missing pieces are: a) which database to target (remote connection details) or b) confirmation to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server here, and c) the exact question you want to answer from the database (what table/columns/conditions/aggregation).",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me which path to take. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested details.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide the connection details: host, port (omit or use 3306 for default), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\", or \"List users created in the last 30 days with columns id, name, email\").\n  - Once you provide those, I will produce a single-line SQL statement in the exact required format:\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n    You will run that SQL (I will expect only the first SQL code block to be executed) and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, database name and a user/password to create (or I can generate defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. This requires running package installation and service initialization commands and will take extra time.\n\nSecurity note: if you provide credentials here they will appear in this session. If you prefer not to share credentials publicly, choose Option A but run the client locally: I will give the single-line SQL and the exact mysql command you can run on your machine (mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"). Then paste back the raw output.\n\nExamples of questions you can ask me to convert into SQL:\n  - \"Show top 5 products by total_sales in 2025 (product_id, total_sales).\"\n  - \"Count the number of users with last_login within the last 30 days.\"\n  - \"List orders (id, user_id, total) where status = 'shipped' and total > 100, ordered by total desc, limit 10.\"\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the exact question you want answered. After that I will produce the single SQL operation in the required format.",
