  "analysis": "The MySQL client has now been installed in the container (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is still no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening 3306). I cannot run any SQL against a database until I have connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or until you ask me to install and run a local server here. You also haven't yet provided the database question you want answered. According to your workflow, I must produce exactly one SQL statement in a single first SQL code block when I choose to operate. For now, we are ready to connect once you provide connection info and the question.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide: (1) the target database connection details (host, port — default 3306, username, password, database name) and (2) the exact question you want answered (what data to retrieve or change). Once you provide those, I will: - craft a single-line SQL statement that addresses your question, wrapped exactly as you required (Action: Operation with a single SQL block in markdown). - you will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL response back. - I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer format. If you prefer me to create a local MySQL server here instead, tell me and I will install and initialize one and then proceed.",
