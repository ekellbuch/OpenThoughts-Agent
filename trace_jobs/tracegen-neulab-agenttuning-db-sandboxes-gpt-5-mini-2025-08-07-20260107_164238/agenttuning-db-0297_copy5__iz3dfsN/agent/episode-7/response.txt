  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening 3306) and you have not provided any remote database connection details or the specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the necessary information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - You must provide: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, database name, and the exact question (what table/columns/conditions/aggregation you want).\n  - Once you provide those, I will craft a single-line SQL statement that answers the question and present it in the exact required format:\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n    (I will produce only one SQL statement per operation. You will execute the statement and paste back the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze and either issue the next single SQL or finalize with Action: Answer.)\n  - Example of how you could run the SQL I provide locally (replace placeholders):\n    mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server. If confirmed I will:\n    1) apt-get install mysql-server (or mariadb-server),\n    2) initialize and start the server, create a database and a user, and\n    3) proceed to run SQL per your question.\n  - This will take more time and change the container state.\n\nPlease choose Option A or B. If Option A, provide the connection details and the exact question you want answered. If Option B, confirm and optionally provide the database name and user/password you prefer. If you want, also tell me whether to use MySQL or MariaDB for the local install.",
