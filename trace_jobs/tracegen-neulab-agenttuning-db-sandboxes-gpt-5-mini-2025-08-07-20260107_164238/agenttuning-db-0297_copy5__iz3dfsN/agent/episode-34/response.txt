  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not supplied any remote DB connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements at this time. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm that you want a local server created here.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of two options so I can proceed: Option A — Connect to an existing database (recommended): provide host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (specify tables/columns/filters/aggregations/sort/limit). I will then explain the SQL I'll run and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will run that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze it and continue or finish with Action: Answer. Option B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB; optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password (or allow defaults). If you confirm, I will list and run the install/initialization commands, start the server, create the DB/user, and then proceed with the same single-SQL-step workflow. If you prefer not to post credentials here, choose Option A and ask me to only provide the SQL plus the exact mysql client command so you can run it locally and paste back the raw output.",
