  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client was installed successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because no target server or credentials were provided, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the required information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will explain the SQL I will run and then produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, a database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list and run the package installation + initialization commands to install and start the server, create the DB and user, and then proceed to answer your question.\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials publicly, choose Option A but tell me to only produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. Example client command I will provide when ready:\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nPlease reply with your choice (Option A or B). If Option A, include connection details and the precise question to answer. If Option B, confirm installation and optionally provide the credentials you want created (or say to use defaults).",
