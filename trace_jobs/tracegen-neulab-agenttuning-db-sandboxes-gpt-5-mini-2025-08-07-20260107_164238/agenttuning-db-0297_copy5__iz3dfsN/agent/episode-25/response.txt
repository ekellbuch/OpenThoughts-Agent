  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because no target server or credentials were provided, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm creating a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state without your explicit instruction. Please choose one of the two options below and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name, and the exact question you want answered (specify tables, columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will explain the SQL I will run and then produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze and continue or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list and run the package installation and initialization commands to install and start the server, create the DB and user, and then proceed to answer your question.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials here, choose Option A and ask me to produce only the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste back raw output. Once you reply with your choice and the required details I will proceed and provide the single SQL operation (or install steps) as appropriate.",
