  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. No MySQL-related command has been run yet. There's no evidence in the prompt of a running MySQL server or an open MySQL client session. Before issuing any SQL I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, whether a Unix socket or TCP port is available, and whether the mysql client is installed so I can connect and run queries. I will inspect the current directory, list files, check running processes for mysqld, look for MySQL sockets, and check for the mysql client binary and its version. After that I will wait for your database question or credentials to connect and run SQL.",
  "plan": "1) Print working directory and list files to see any database artifacts in /app. 2) Check running processes for mysqld to see if a server is running. 3) List listening TCP sockets to find a MySQL TCP port (3306) if present. 4) Search the filesystem for mysqld socket files. 5) Check whether the mysql client binary exists and its version. Based on these results, we'll either connect to MySQL or ask you for database connection details. Each command is chosen to gather required information safely and quickly.",
