  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor a specific question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements right now.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\n  - I'll explain the SQL I will run and then produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will run only that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm whether to install MySQL or MariaDB and optionally provide desired root password, database name, and user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials here, choose Option A but ask me to only produce the single-line SQL plus the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. Tell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the precise question you want answered.",
