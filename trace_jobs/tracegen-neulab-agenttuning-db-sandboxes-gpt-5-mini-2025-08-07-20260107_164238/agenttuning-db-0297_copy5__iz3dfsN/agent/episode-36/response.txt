  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database yet. The container is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm creating a local server.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of two options so I can proceed, and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - After you provide those I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run, and (2) present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute that single SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze and continue or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, a database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server and to create the DB and user, then proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to post credentials here, choose Option A and ask me to produce only the single-line SQL plus the exact mysql client command you can run locally and paste back the raw output.\n\nWhen you reply, state \"Option A\" with the connection details and the precise question, or \"Option B\" with confirmation and any desired credentials (or say use defaults).",
