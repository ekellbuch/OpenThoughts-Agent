  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor the specific question you want answered. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any operations until you choose one of the two options below and provide the required information.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host, port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\" or \"List users created in the last 30 days with columns id, name, email\").\n  - After you provide those, I will explain my reasoning and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with one SQL code block). You will execute that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze the output and either issue the next single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm whether you want me to install MySQL or MariaDB and optionally provide a root password, database name, and user credentials (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. This will require running package installation and initialization commands.\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials publicly, choose Option A but tell me to provide only the SQL and the full mysql client command so you can run it locally and paste back the output. Examples of exact question formats you can provide: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\", \"List id, name, email from users created in the last 30 days\", or \"Show top 5 products by total_sales in 2025 (product_id, total_sales)\". Once you give the choice and details I will proceed.",
