  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm installing/initializing a local server.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two options so I can proceed and then I'll produce the single SQL statement per your workflow:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will explain the SQL I plan to run and then present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow me to choose defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server and to create the database/user. After the server is available I will proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A and ask me to only provide the SQL plus the exact mysql client command you can run locally; then paste the raw output here. Please reply with \"Option A\" and the connection details plus your precise question, or \"Option B\" and confirmation (and any desired credentials).",
