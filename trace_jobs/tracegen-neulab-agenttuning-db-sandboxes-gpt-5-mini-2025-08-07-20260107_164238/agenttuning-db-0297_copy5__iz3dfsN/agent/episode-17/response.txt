  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor the specific database question you'd like answered. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL at this time. The environment is prepared to connect to a database once you provide connection info or confirm creation of a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, database name, and the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, and limit if applicable).\n  - I will then: (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute that one SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, a database name, and a user/password to create (or let me choose defaults).\n  - If confirmed I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. This will take more time and change the container state.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials here, choose Option A but ask me only to produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. Example client command format I can provide when ready: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the requested details and the precise question you want answered. Once you do, I will explain my reasoning and then provide the single SQL operation in the exact required format.",
