  "analysis": "Current environment: the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306) and you have not provided any remote connection details or the specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements. The container is ready to connect to a database once you provide connection info or confirm that you want a local server installed and initialized here.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you choose a path. Please pick one of the two options below and supply the requested information.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password, and database name.\n - Provide the exact question you want answered (clear specification of table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, sort and limit if applicable).\n - I will then: (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, and (2) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze it and either produce another single SQL operation or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n - Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow me to generate defaults).\n - If confirmed I will install and start the server, create the database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. Note: this will change the container state and takes longer.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials in this chat, choose Option A and tell me to only produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output back here.\n\nExamples of precise questions you can send me to turn into SQL:\n - \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'.\"\n - \"List id, name, email from users created in the last 30 days, ordered by created_at desc, limit 50.\"\n - \"Show top 5 products by total_sales in 2025 (product_id, total_sales).\"\n\nOnce you reply with your choice and the required details (connection info + question, or confirmation to install a local server and credentials to create), I will prepare the single SQL operation (Action: Operation) and explain my reasoning prior to that operation.",
