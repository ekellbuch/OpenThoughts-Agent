  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot run any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I intend to run and produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow me to generate defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed. I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials here, choose Option A and tell me to only provide the single-line SQL plus the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the precise question you want answered. After that I will explain my reasoning and produce the single SQL operation in the exact required format.",
