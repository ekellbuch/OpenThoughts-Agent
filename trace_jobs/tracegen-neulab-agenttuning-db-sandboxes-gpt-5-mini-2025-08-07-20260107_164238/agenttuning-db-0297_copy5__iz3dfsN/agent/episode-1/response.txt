  "analysis": "I inspected the current container. /app is empty. There is no MySQL server process running (no mysqld in ps output), no listening TCP sockets shown, no MySQL socket files found, and the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). So I cannot run any SQL yet because there is no client to connect with and no running server to connect to. To proceed I need a MySQL client (or other client like mariadb) installed here, and then you must provide connection details (host, port, username, password, and database) so I can connect and run SQL statements. If you instead want me to install a server here and create a database locally, I can attempt that, but usually it's better to connect to an existing DB if one is intended.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package so we can run SQL against a remote or local server. I'll run apt-get update and then install the default-mysql-client package. 2) Confirm the mysql client is available by checking its version. 3) After the client is installed I'll ask you for the DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the SQL question you want answered. Once you provide those, I'll craft a single-line SQL statement in the required \"Action: Operation\" format for you to execute, then analyze the output and continue as needed.",
