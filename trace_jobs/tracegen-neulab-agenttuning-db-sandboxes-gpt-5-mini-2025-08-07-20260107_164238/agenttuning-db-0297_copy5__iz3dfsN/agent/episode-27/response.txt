  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor the specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm creation of a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the required information so I can proceed.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I will run and present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format:\n\n    Action: Operation\n    ```sql\n    <ONE-LINE SQL STATEMENT>;\n    ```\n\n    You will execute only that SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install and initialize the server, start it, create the DB and user, and then proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A and ask me to provide only the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n  - \"Option A\" and the connection details + the precise question to answer, or\n  - \"Option B\" and confirmation (and any desired credentials or say to use defaults).\n\nAfter you reply I will (1) explain my SQL approach and then (2) provide the single SQL operation (Action: Operation) as required.",
