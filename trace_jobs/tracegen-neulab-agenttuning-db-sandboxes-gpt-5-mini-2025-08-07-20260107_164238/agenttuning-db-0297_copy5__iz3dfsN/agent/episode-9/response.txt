  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no socket found, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor the specific database question you want answered. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the needed information:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide: host, port (omit or use 3306 for default), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (for example: \"Count rows in orders where status = 'shipped'\" or \"List users created in the last 30 days\").\n  - Once you provide those, I will produce a single-line SQL statement formatted exactly as required: Action: Operation followed by one SQL code block (one statement, one line). You will run that statement and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will analyze the output and either issue the next single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - If you confirm, tell me whether to install MySQL or MariaDB and provide any desired root password/database/user credentials.\n  - I will install, initialize, and start the server, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to run SQL per your question.\n\nNotes:\n  - If you want me to craft the mysql client command to run the SQL I provide locally, I can give it (example: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\").\n  - Provide credentials only if you intend them to be used in this session; otherwise run the SQL locally and paste back the raw output.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the required details and the exact question you want answered. I will then produce the single SQL operation in the required format.",
