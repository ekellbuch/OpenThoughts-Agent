  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). You have not provided any remote database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor a specific database question to answer. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements against a database yet. The environment is ready to connect once you provide connection info or confirm creating a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not change the container state without your instruction. Please choose one of these two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limit, etc.).\n  - Workflow after you provide details: I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and why, then (2) present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answers array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and indicate whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, a database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list the exact shell commands I will run to install, initialize, and start the server and to create the DB and user. After the server is available I will proceed to answer your question using the same single-SQL-step workflow.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A but tell me to only produce the SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n  - \"Option A\" plus connection details and the precise question to answer, or\n  - \"Option B\" plus confirmation (and any desired credentials or say to use defaults).\n\nAfter you reply I will (1) explain my SQL approach and then (2) provide the single SQL operation (Action: Operation) as required.",
