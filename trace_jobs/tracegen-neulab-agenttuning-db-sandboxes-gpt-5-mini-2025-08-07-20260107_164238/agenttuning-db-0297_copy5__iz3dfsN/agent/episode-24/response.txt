  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). No remote connection details (host, port, username, password, database) or a specific database question have been provided. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (clearly specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\n  - I will then explain the SQL I intend to run and present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one SQL statement. You will execute that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze and continue or finish with Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Create a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide desired root password, database name, and a user/password to create (or allow defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will list and run the installation and initialization commands to install and start the server, create the DB and user, and then proceed to answer your question.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A but ask me to only produce the single-line SQL and the exact mysql client command; you can run it locally and paste the raw output here. Provide your choice and the required details (or confirm local install) and I will proceed.",
