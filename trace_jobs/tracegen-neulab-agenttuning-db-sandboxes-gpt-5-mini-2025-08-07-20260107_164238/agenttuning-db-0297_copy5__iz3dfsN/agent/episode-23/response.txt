  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The MySQL client has been installed (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally (no mysqld process, no socket file, no listening TCP port 3306). No remote connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and no database question have been provided. Because there is no target server or credentials, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n  - Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password, and database name.\n  - Provide the exact question you want answered (specify table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.).\n  - After you provide those, I will: (1) explain the SQL I will run, and then (2) present exactly one single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single SQL code block). You will execute only that SQL statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze the output and either issue the next single SQL statement or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array.\n\nOption B — Create and use a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n  - Confirm you want this and state whether you prefer MySQL or MariaDB. Optionally provide a desired root password, a database name, and a user/password to create (or let me pick defaults).\n  - If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested database and user, and then proceed to answer your question. If you choose this, I will list the exact shell commands I will run before executing them.\n\nIf you prefer not to paste credentials publicly, choose Option A and ask me to only produce the SQL plus the exact mysql client command (mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"); you can run that locally and paste the raw output here.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n  - Option A and the connection details + the precise question to answer, or\n  - Option B and confirmation (and any desired credentials or say to use defaults).\n\nOnce you reply I will explain my SQL approach and then provide the single SQL operation (Action: Operation) as required.",
