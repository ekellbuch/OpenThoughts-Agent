  "analysis": "So far: the container has no mysql client binary and no mysqld process. A search found no MySQL socket, no my.cnf, and no obvious database files under /app or shallow checks elsewhere. Python 3.12 is installed, but Python MySQL adapters (pymysql, mysql.connector) are not present. Therefore we cannot run SQL against a MySQL server yet because (a) no server was found/running and (b) no client/connector is available to issue SQL. What still needs to be done: either locate an accessible MySQL server and credentials, or install a client/connector so we can connect if the server is reachable. Also we should search more broadly for any DB files (including SQLite) that might contain the data required.",
  "plan": "1) Check if pip is available (python3 -m pip). 2) If pip is available, install Python MySQL connectors (PyMySQL and mysql-connector-python) so we can issue SQL via Python if network/credentials are provided. 3) Re-check imports to confirm installation succeeded. 4) Search the filesystem for common DB files (sqlite, .db) in case the data is stored there. 5) Check whether apt-get exists as a fallback option to install the mysql client (only detecting, not installing yet). After these steps we'll either be ready to connect (if server/credentials are provided) or we'll ask you for the DB host/credentials or permission to install system packages.",
