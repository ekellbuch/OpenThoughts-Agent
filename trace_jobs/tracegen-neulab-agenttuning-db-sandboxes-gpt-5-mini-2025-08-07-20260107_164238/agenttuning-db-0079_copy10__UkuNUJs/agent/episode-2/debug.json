On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds.

It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nI will ask you a question, then you should help me operate a MySQL database with SQL to answer the question.\nYou have to explain the problem and your solution to me and write down your thoughts.\nAfter thinking and explaining thoroughly, every round you can choose to operate or to answer.\nyour operation should be like this:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;\n```\nYou MUST put SQL in markdown format without any other comments.
