  "analysis": "Current environment: a minimal container at /app. I ran basic checks already: ls shows only . and ..; no mysqld/mariadb processes found; mysql client not installed; /etc/mysql/debian.cnf not present; no MySQL-related environment variables; no .sql files found under /app, /var/lib/mysql, or /etc (within maxdepth 3). In short, there is no accessible MySQL server or client visible yet. To run SQL I need either a running MySQL server/socket and a client, or a way to connect (credentials, socket path, or network host/port). None of that has been discovered so far.",
  "plan": "Search the filesystem for MySQL artifacts (sockets, data files, configuration files) and for alternate binaries (mariadb, mysqladmin). Check common runtime directories (/run, /var/run) for mysqld sockets. Check whether Python is available and whether a MySQL connector library exists (pymysql or mysql.connector) as a fallback for issuing SQL if the mysql client is missing. Based on results I will decide next steps: (a) if a socket or server is found, attempt to connect with available client; (b) if no server, but connector library exists, use Python to connect if network/host credentials are available; (c) if neither is present, request more information or attempt to install a client (if network access is allowed). The following commands will look for sockets, data files, config files, alternative binaries, and Python/mysql libraries.",
