  "analysis": "You are in a shell session (root@...:/app). No SQL has been executed yet. There is no visible MySQL output or connection state in the terminal screen. Before issuing SQL statements to the database, we need to discover whether a MySQL server is present/running, whether the mysql client is available, and any local credentials (common locations: /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, environment variables, or .my.cnf). We may also search for .sql files or a database file to inspect. Nothing has been accomplished yet; the next steps are to detect the MySQL server/client and gather connection details so we can run SQL safely.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see project files. 2) Check for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 3) Check for any listening MySQL port (3306). 4) Check if the mysql client is installed and its version. 5) Try to read /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (commonly contains local root credentials in Debian-based container images). 6) Search environment variables for MySQL-related values. 7) Search common locations for .sql files to understand the DB schema/data if present. After these checks, we'll know how to connect and then can issue the required single-line SQL statements as requested.",
