  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app inside a container. The shell warns about no job control; otherwise it's a normal bash prompt. There is currently no interaction with MySQL yet and no SQL has been executed. I cannot see any files or running services yet. Before issuing SQL, I need to discover whether a MySQL client is available, whether a MySQL server is running (and where: TCP port or socket), and whether any credentials are available (e.g., ~/.my.cnf or environment variables). The next steps are to probe the filesystem and processes to find the MySQL client, server socket, data directory, and any credentials so I can run a proper single-statement SQL when you later ask the question.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm current user and working directory. 2) List files in the current directory to see project files. 3) Check for MySQL data directory and socket files (/var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld). 4) Check whether the mysql client binary exists and its version. 5) Check processes for a running mysqld. 6) Check listening TCP ports to see if MySQL is listening on 3306. 7) Look for environment variables that may contain DB credentials (e.g., MYSQL_*, DB_*, or related). 8) Check for a root user's MySQL config file (~/.my.cnf) for stored credentials. Based on these results, I'll know how to connect and will then produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format when you ask the database question. Each command is chosen to reveal specific info needed to form a correct mysql invocation.",
