  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app but no MySQL interaction has been done yet. The terminal shows only the shell prompt. To operate the MySQL database I need to find the mysql client/binary, determine whether a MySQL server is running and where its data/socket is, and identify credentials or environment variables (common in container setups). Nothing has been accomplished yet toward accessing the database.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current directory and environment for clues (files, env vars mentioning MySQL). 2) Check whether a mysql client binary exists and its version. 3) Check if a MySQL/MariaDB server process is running and where its data directory/socket is. 4) List /var/lib/mysql (common data dir) and /etc/mysql to find configuration. Based on that info I'll decide the next step (connect with mysql client or adjust commands). I will run lightweight commands to gather this info before attempting any SQL. Each command is brief; I'll wait a short time for command completion.",
