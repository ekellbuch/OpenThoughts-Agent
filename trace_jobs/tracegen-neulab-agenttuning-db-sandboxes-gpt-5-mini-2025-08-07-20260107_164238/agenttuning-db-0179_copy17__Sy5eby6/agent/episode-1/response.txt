  "analysis": "Current container has no MySQL client or server present. which mysql returned nothing and mysql --version failed; ps shows no mysqld process; /var/run/mysqld and /etc/mysql do not exist. Nothing has been executed against a database yet. To run SQL I need a MySQL client (to send queries) and connection info (host, port, user, password, database) or a running local server. Right now only the shell is available, so the next step is to install a MySQL/MariaDB client so I can run SQL statements once you provide the database question and credentials or confirm a local server should be installed.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL-compatible client (default-mysql-client). 3) Verify installation by checking which mysql and mysql --version. After that I will ask you to provide the database question and connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Once you provide the question and credentials, I will produce the single-line SQL statement inside a single SQL code block as required, and you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output for me to process further.",
