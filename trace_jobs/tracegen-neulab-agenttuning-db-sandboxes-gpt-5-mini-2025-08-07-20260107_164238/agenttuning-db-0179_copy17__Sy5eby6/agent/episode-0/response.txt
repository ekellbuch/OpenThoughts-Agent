  "analysis": "You are in a container shell at /app as root. No recent commands or MySQL queries have been run in this session. The task description says you'll ask a question about a MySQL database and I should help by issuing SQL statements (one at a time) and explaining. Right now no SQL has been executed and I don't know whether a MySQL server or client is available or how to connect. Before you ask the specific database question, I should discover whether the mysql client is installed and whether a MySQL server is running or reachable from this container. Once you provide the question, I will craft a single-line SQL statement inside a single SQL code block as requested. For now I will probe the environment to find the mysql client and server socket/config so I can connect when you give the database question.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a MySQL client binary (which mysql) and its version (mysql --version) so I know if I can run queries from this shell. 2) Check for a running MySQL process to see if a local server is present (ps aux | grep -i mysql). 3) Inspect the usual MySQL socket directory to find a socket path (/var/run/mysqld) or other runtime files. 4) List MySQL configuration directory (/etc/mysql) to find config if needed to determine credentials. After these checks, I'll report findings and ask you to provide the specific database question (and credentials or connection info if needed).",
