  "analysis": "So far I inspected the container. There is no mysql client or server installed: 'mysql' command is not found, /var/lib/mysql doesn't exist, there is no /root/.my.cnf or /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, and no mysqld process is running. To operate a MySQL-compatible database I must either connect to an existing server (none found) or install and start a database server here (and a client to run SQL). The environment appears to be a minimal container with apt available (not yet confirmed), so the most straightforward next step is to install MariaDB server and client, start the server, then run SQL via the mysql client.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists. 2) Install mariadb-server and mariadb-client noninteractively. 3) Attempt to start the MariaDB server using service/init script or fall back to mysqld_safe if needed. 4) Verify the server process is running. 5) Run a simple SQL command to confirm we can execute SQL (SELECT VERSION()). If the server starts and the client works, I will then ask you the question you want answered and proceed to run the SQL you request (one statement per round, per your rules).",
