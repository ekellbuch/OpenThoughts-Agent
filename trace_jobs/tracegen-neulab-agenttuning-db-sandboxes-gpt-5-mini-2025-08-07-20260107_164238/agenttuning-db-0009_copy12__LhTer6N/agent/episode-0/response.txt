  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside /app (prompt shows root@dc4f83cce324:/app#) but there is no visible output yet. No MySQL connection has been made. I need to discover whether a MySQL server is available in this environment, whether the mysql client is installed, and whether any credentials or socket/config files exist so I can run SQL against the database. Nothing has been executed yet in this session.",
  "plan": "I'll inspect the filesystem and processes to locate the mysql client, check for a running MySQL server (process or listening TCP port 3306), and look for possible client configuration files that might contain credentials (/root/.my.cnf, /etc/mysql/debian.cnf). Steps and expected results: 1) List current directory and /app to see any project files. 2) Check for the mysql client binary and its version. 3) Check running processes for mysqld to see if a server is running. 4) Check listening TCP ports to see if 3306 is active. 5) Inspect /var/lib/mysql for data files (indicates local server). 6) Check common client config files for stored credentials. Based on results I'll decide the next SQL or connection command.",
