  "analysis": "Current container shell shows you're root in /app. There are no application files here. I checked for a MySQL client and service: the mysql client is not installed (which mysql returned nothing) and no mysqld socket/config directories are present (/var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql are empty). A previous attempt to run mysql failed with 'command not found'. To query the database I need a MySQL/MariaDB client available in the container. There is no evidence a server is running locally; if a DB server exists elsewhere you'll need its host/credentials. For now I'll install a client and then try to connect to localhost to list databases; that will reveal whether a server is running locally or whether authentication is required.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages.\n2) Install a MySQL-compatible client (default-mysql-client). If that package is unavailable, attempt mariadb-client as a fallback.\n3) Verify the client is present by running mysql --version.\n4) Attempt a non-interactive connection to localhost as root to run SHOW DATABASES; this will either list databases, show authentication errors, or indicate no server is running. Based on that output (which you'll paste back), I'll decide the next SQL operation or provide the final answer.\n\nI will run apt-get update, then apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, verify, and then run SHOW DATABASES via the mysql client.",
