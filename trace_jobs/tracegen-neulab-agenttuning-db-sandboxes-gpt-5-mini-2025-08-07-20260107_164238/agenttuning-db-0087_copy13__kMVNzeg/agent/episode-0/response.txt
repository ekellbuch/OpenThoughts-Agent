  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside a container. No commands have been run yet. There is no information yet about a MySQL server or client being available, no database schema, and no previous SQL output to act on. To proceed I need to detect whether the mysql client is installed, whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running, where its socket and data directories are, and attempt a connection (if possible) so you can provide the MySQL query result back to me for the next step.",
  "plan": "1) Gather basic environment/process info (whoami, cwd, list files in /app) to ensure context.\n2) Check if a mysql client binary exists and its version.\n3) Check for running mysqld processes to know if a server is running.\n4) Check common MySQL socket and data directory paths to locate the server socket/files.\n5) Attempt a non-interactive connection with mysql client (root, no password) to run a simple SHOW DATABASES; so you can return the output. If authentication fails, we'll see that and adjust.\n\nI will run commands in sequence so you can paste back the MySQL client output for the SQL statement I request next. The only SQL I will issue (per instructions) is in a single-line code block when I choose to operate; for now I'm only probing the environment so I will not run any SQL yet.",
