  "analysis": "I installed the mysql client successfully. There is no MySQL server running locally: /var/run/mysqld does not exist, no mysqld process was found, and attempts to connect to the local socket failed with ERROR 2002. There is no client config (~/.my.cnf) or environment variables with credentials. In short: we have a client but no accessible server or credentials to connect to a server.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide connection details so I can run SQL and answer your question. You can either:\n\n1) Provide remote (or local) database connection info: host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, and password (or indicate a .my.cnf file to use). Once you provide that, I'll issue a single SQL statement (in the required format) to inspect the schema or data as needed. Example test command I will run once you provide credentials: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SELECT 1;\" (I will run the exact SQL you request in the specified format).\n\n2) Ask me to start a local server in this container. I can attempt to install and start a MySQL/MariaDB server here, but that requires additional packages and configuration and may be more complex. If you want that, confirm and I'll proceed with commands to install and initialize a server (or start an available server image).\n\nSecurity note: supplying credentials on the command line may expose them via process listings. If you prefer, provide a temporary .my.cnf file contents or instruct me to use a credentials file. Also tell me what SQL question you want answered (which table/columns/conditions) so I can prepare the exact single SQL statement to execute per your rules.",
