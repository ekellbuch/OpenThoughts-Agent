  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server accessible: no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process, no /root/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose which path to proceed and provide the required information.\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username and password — OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf with a [client] section (user, password, host, port). If you supply a .my.cnf, I will write it to /root/.my.cnf (0600) and use it to connect.\n- Also tell me the exact SQL question (which table(s) and conditions). Once you provide that, I will produce one SQL statement (in the exact required format) and execute it.\n\nOption B — Start a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server. If you confirm, I will install the server packages, initialize/start the server, optionally create a user/database you specify, and then run the SQL you request. This requires several package-install steps and a bit more time.\n\nSecurity note: Passing passwords on the command line can be exposed in process listings. If you prefer not to expose a password, give me the ~/.my.cnf contents instead.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply any required details (credentials or confirmation to install a server) and the exact SQL question you want answered. After you provide that, I will (per your rules) output a single SQL statement in the required format and then run it.",
