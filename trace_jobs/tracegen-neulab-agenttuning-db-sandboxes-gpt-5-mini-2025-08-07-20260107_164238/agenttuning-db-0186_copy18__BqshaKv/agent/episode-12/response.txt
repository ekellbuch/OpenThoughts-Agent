  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). However there is no MySQL server accessible from this environment: no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process, no /root/.my.cnf and no environment variables with connection info. Because of that I cannot execute any SQL against a database yet. No database files, dumps, or credentials have been provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details.\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, and password; OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf file with a [client] section (user, password, host, port).\n- Also tell me the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, and any WHERE conditions). Once you provide those, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format and run it via the mysql client.\n\nSecurity note for Option A: If you prefer not to expose the password on the command line, supply a .my.cnf contents and I will write it to /root/.my.cnf with mode 0600 and use it to connect.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL or MariaDB server here. If you confirm, also optionally provide the DB name, username and password you want created. I will then:\n  1) install the server packages and initialize it,\n  2) start the server,\n  3) create any requested user/database,\n  4) run the SQL you specify.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary connection details or confirmation to install a server, plus the exact SQL question (table/schema and conditions). After you provide that, I will produce the single SQL statement (in the required format) and execute it.",
