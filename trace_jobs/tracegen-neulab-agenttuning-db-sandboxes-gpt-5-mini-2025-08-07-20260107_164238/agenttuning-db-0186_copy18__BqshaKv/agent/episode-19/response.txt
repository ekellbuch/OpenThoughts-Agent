  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe). The server process runs as user mysql, the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root via the Unix socket (a test query returned the server version). There is currently no specific SQL question or target (database/table) provided by you, so I have not executed any further SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want me to do next. Common next steps:\n\n- Inspect the server: list databases so we can decide which one to query (SHOW DATABASES;).\n- Inspect a specific database: list tables in a named database (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;).\n- Query data: run a SELECT on a specific table with columns/conditions you specify.\n- Modify data/schema: run CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements you specify.\n\nIf you want me to inspect the environment first, I suggest running one of these (I will only output one SQL statement at a time as you requested). Tell me which of the actions above you want and, if applicable, provide the target database/table and any conditions. Once you specify, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.",
