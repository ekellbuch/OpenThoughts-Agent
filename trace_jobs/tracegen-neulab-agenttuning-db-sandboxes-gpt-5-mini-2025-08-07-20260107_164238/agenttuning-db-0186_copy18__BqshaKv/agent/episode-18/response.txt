  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container (mariadbd started via mysqld_safe). The server process runs as user mysql, the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root via the Unix socket (mysql -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" returned 10.11.13-MariaDB...). There is no root password configured for socket auth, so we can run SQL locally as root without a password.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me what you want. Please choose one of the following actions:\n\n1) Inspect schema: ask me to list databases or tables (for example, I can run SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;). If you want this, tell me exactly which listing you want and I will produce one SQL statement in the required format.\n\n2) Query data: tell me the exact question (which database, table, columns, and WHERE conditions). I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format and then run it.\n\n3) Modify the database: if you want to create/drop objects or insert/update rows, tell me the exact SQL operation to perform; I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format and run it.\n\nReminder of the rule you gave: when I output SQL it must be inside a single markdown SQL code block preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and contain exactly one SQL statement on a single line. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide. If you prefer, I can first list available databases for guidance.\n\nTell me which of the above you want and provide the target database/table or the exact question. Once you do, I will output the single SQL statement per your rules.",
