  "analysis": "You are in a container as root in /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process), no /root/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with connection info. Because of that I cannot execute any SQL against any database yet. No database files, dumps, or credentials have been provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details (or confirm), then I will perform the appropriate steps and run the single SQL statement per your rules.\n\nOption A — Use an existing remote/local database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username and password; OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf with a [client] section (user=..., password=..., host=..., port=...).\n- Also tell me the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, and WHERE conditions). If you provide a .my.cnf I will write it to /root/.my.cnf with permissions 0600 and use mysql -e \"<SQL>\"; if you provide credentials I will connect using mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"<SQL>\".\n- Security note: giving passwords on the command line can expose them via process listings; prefer a .my.cnf if you want to avoid that.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server here. Optionally provide the DB name, username and password to create.\n- If you confirm, I will run apt-get update and install a server (mariadb-server or mysql-server), initialize/start it, create the requested user/database if specified, and then run the SQL you request.\n- This will take additional time and will change the container state (packages installed, service started).\n\nAfter you pick an option and provide necessary details (and the exact question), I will output exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) and then run it. If you confirm Option B, tell me whether you prefer mariadb-server or mysql-server and the credentials/DB name to create.",
