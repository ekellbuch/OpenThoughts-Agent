  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). Previously there was no mysqld process and /etc/mysql did not exist. At this point we have a client but there is still no evidence of a running local MySQL server or any database credentials/configuration files. To execute SQL I need either a running MySQL server (local or remote) and credentials, or a .my.cnf with stored credentials. Right now these are missing/unconfirmed.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a local MySQL socket/directory to see if a server is running (look in /var/run/mysqld). 2) Check for a client config file (~/.my.cnf or /root/.my.cnf) that may contain credentials. 3) Inspect environment variables for MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PWD, etc. 4) Attempt a simple connection with the mysql client as root without password to test connectivity; if that fails, try explicitly using the socket if present. If these attempts fail, I'll report the results and ask you to provide the database host, port, username, and password (or a .cnf) or start a server.",
