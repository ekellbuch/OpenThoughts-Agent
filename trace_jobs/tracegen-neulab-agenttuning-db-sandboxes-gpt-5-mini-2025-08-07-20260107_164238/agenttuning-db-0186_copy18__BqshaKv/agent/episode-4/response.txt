  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and working, but there is no MySQL server available in this container: no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process, and no client config or credentials found. I cannot run any SQL against a database until either (A) you provide connection details (host, port, user, password or a .my.cnf) for an accessible MySQL server, or (B) you ask me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container so I can create and query databases locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the following and tell me which you want:\n\nOption 1 — Provide connection details: give me host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username and password (or provide the contents of a .my.cnf). Also tell me the exact question you want answered (which table/columns/conditions). Once you provide those I will construct a single SQL statement in the required format and run it via the mysql client to get results.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local server here: tell me to proceed and I will install and initialize a local MariaDB/MySQL server and start it. After it's running I'll create any needed users/databases (if you specify) and then run the SQL you request. This requires additional package installs and initialization steps.\n\nSecurity note: If you provide credentials on the command line, they may appear in process listings. If you prefer, provide them via a temporary /root/.my.cnf file content and I will use that instead.\n\nWhen you reply, indicate the option and supply the necessary connection details and the exact SQL question (table/schema info if known).",
