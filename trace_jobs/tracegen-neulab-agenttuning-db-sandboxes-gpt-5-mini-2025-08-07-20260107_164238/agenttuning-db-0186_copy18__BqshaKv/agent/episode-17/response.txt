The socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and the mysql client can connect via the Unix socket (mysql -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" returned 10.11.13-MariaDB...). The data directory /var/lib/mysql is present and owned by mysql. There are no visible error logs indicating problems. We are ready to run SQL against this local MariaDB instance as root via the socket (no password required for the local unix-socket root user).",

Please provide the SQL question (which table(s), columns, and conditions) or tell me if you want me to inspect the schema first (for example, list databases/tables). When you give the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute only the first SQL code block. If you want me to run any administrative steps (create database, create user, import data), tell me and I will perform those operations (and will explain each step). If you want me to inspect schema first, say so and I will issue a single SQL to list tables (e.g., show tables from db).",
