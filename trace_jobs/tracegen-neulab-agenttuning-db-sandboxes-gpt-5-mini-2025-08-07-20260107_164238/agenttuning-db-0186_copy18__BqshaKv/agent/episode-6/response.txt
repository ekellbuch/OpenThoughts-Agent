  "analysis": "You're at a root shell in /app inside the container. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld, no mysqld process), no /root/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL until you either (A) provide connection details to an existing MySQL server (host, port, username, password or a .my.cnf), or (B) instruct me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container so I can run SQL locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these two options and provide the needed information. After you decide, I'll perform the exact steps below depending on your choice:\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (preferred):\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password, OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf (with [client] user=... password=... host=...).\n- I will construct one SQL statement (per your rules) in the required format and then run it using the mysql client to fetch results. Example connection command I will run (if you give credentials on the command line): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"<SQL>\". If you give a /root/.my.cnf, I will write it to /root/.my.cnf (0600) and run mysql -e \"<SQL>\".\n- Security note: passwords on the command line may be visible in process listings. If you prefer to avoid that, give me a .my.cnf content instead of a raw password.\n\nOption B — Install a local server here:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local server. If you confirm I will run commands to install and start a server and then (optionally) create a database/user you specify.\n- Exact commands I would run if you confirm Option B (examples):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server)\n  3) systemctl start mariadb (or use mysqld_safe / service start), initialize DB if needed\n  4) mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass'; CREATE DATABASE db; GRANT ALL ON db.* TO 'user'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"\n  5) Then run the SQL you request via mysql -uuser -p'pass' -D db -e \"<SQL>\"\n- Note: installing and running a DB server in this environment may require a few minutes and additional configuration; I will proceed only after you confirm.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the required details and the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, conditions). When you want me to execute SQL, I will follow your rule and output precisely one SQL statement in a single markdown code block prefixed by the Action: Operation header (no other SQL blocks); you will run only the first SQL block and give me the output.",
