  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running in the container. I started mariadbd via mysqld_safe and confirmed connectivity using the mysql client. SHOW DATABASES; returned only the system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys), so there are currently no user-created databases. I inspected system tables: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; and queried mysql.user to list defined accounts (mariadb.sys, mysql, root all bound to localhost). I also listed the sys database tables for useful views. At this point we have a working local DB server and can run arbitrary SQL as root via the Unix socket (no password needed).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly what you want done next. Options and next-actions I can take (I will only run a single SQL statement each time, per your rules):\n\n1) Inspect schema further\n   - Show databases (already done). If you want to inspect a specific database's tables, tell me the database name and I'll run:\n     Action: Operation\n     ```sql\n     SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n     ```\n\n2) Inspect database users / privileges\n   - To list user authentication info (plugin, authentication string), I can run:\n     Action: Operation\n     ```sql\n     SELECT User, Host, plugin, authentication_string FROM mysql.user;\n     ```\n\n3) Query data in an existing table\n   - Tell me the database, table, columns and conditions. Example single-statement SELECT I would emit (you must run it):\n     Action: Operation\n     ```sql\n     SELECT col1, col2 FROM dbname.tablename WHERE condition LIMIT 100;\n     ```\n\n4) Create a new database/table and insert sample data\n   - If you want a new DB and test data, provide the DB name, table schema and sample rows. I can run one SQL statement at a time (e.g., CREATE DATABASE dbname;), then you would run subsequent statements.\n\n5) Create a user and grant privileges\n   - Provide username/password and privileges; I can run a single GRANT/CREATE USER statement when you're ready.\n\nSecurity note: running mysql commands with passwords on the command line can expose credentials in process listings; prefer to use the local socket as root (no password) or provide a /root/.my.cnf if you need non-root credentials.\n\nTell me which option you want and give the exact target (database/table/columns/conditions or user/db names). I will then produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted per your rule) and you will execute it and give me the output.",
