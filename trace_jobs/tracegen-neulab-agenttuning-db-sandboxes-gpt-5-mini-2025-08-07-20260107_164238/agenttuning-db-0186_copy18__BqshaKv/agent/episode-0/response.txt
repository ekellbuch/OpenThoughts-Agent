  "analysis": "I'm at a root shell in /app inside the container. No MySQL commands have been run yet. I don't see any information about a running MySQL server, available clients, or credentials. Before issuing SQL, I need to locate the MySQL client/server, config or dumps, and attempt a connection (or ask you for credentials if needed).",
  "plan": "1) Inspect current working directory and user to confirm environment. 2) List files in /app to find any DB dumps or config. 3) Check for system MySQL configuration directory (/etc/mysql) and whether a mysqld process is running. 4) Check whether a mysql client binary is available. 5) If client is present and server appears running, attempt a quick test connection as root without password (this may fail if auth is required). If the connection fails, I'll report back and request credentials or connection details.\n\nCommands will perform these checks in order. The mysql client test will try a harmless one-line statement to see connectivity (no schema changes).",
