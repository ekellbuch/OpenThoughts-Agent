  "analysis": "I have root in /app in this container. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld, no mysqld process), no ~/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database yet because there is no reachable server or credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these two ways forward and provide the needed information. I will not run any commands until you tell me which you prefer.\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, and password. If you prefer not to send the password on the command line, provide the contents of a ~/.my.cnf that I can write to /root/.my.cnf. Also tell me the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, and condition). Once you provide those, I will emit one SQL statement (in the required single-line SQL markdown code block) and then run it using the mysql client to retrieve results.\n\nOption B — Start a local server here:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container. If you confirm, I will run package installation and initialization commands, start the server, create a user/database if you request, and then run the SQL you specify.\n\nNotes about how I will operate after you choose:\n- Per your rules, when I issue SQL it will be exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block and on one line; you will execute only the first SQL block returned. Example I will produce when ready:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE id=1;\n```\n- If you want me to avoid exposing credentials on the process list, provide a ~/.my.cnf content instead of a plain password. If you provide credentials on the command line be aware they may be visible to other processes.\n\nTell me which option you want and give the necessary details and the exact question to answer. If you want Option B, confirm and optionally tell me username/password/database to create.",
