  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld, no mysqld process), no /root/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with connection info. Because of that I cannot run any SQL against a database yet — I need either connection credentials to an existing server or permission to install and start a local server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to pick one of two options and provide required details.\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username and password, OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf (with a [client] section). Also tell me the exact SQL question (which table(s), columns, and conditions).\n- After you supply these I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format and run it.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server. Optionally provide desired DB name, username and password to create. If you confirm, I will run the install and initialization commands, start the server, create the requested user/database, and then run the SQL you specify.\n\nSecurity note: supplying passwords on the command line can expose them via process listings; prefer providing a /root/.my.cnf content if you want to avoid that.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the exact question you want answered.",
