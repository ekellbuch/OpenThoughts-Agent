  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, version 8.0.44) but there is no accessible MySQL server: no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process, no /root/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with credentials. Because of that I cannot execute any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required details.\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (default 3306 if omitted), username and password OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf (with a [client] section: user=..., password=..., host=..., port=...).\n- Also tell me the exact question you want answered (which table(s), columns, and any conditions). Once you provide that, I will produce one SQL statement in the exact required format and execute it.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server. If you confirm, I will run package installation and initialization commands, start the server, optionally create a user/database you specify, and then run the SQL you request. This will take additional time.\n\nSecurity note: Supplying passwords on the command line can expose them in process listings. If you prefer to avoid that, give me a ~/.my.cnf content and I will write it to /root/.my.cnf with mode 0600 and use it to connect.\n\nWhen you provide the connection details and the exact question, I will (per your rules) output a single SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block preceded by 'Action: Operation' and then run that statement. If you want me to proceed now, reply with your chosen option and the necessary details.",
