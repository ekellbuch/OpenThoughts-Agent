SHOW DATABASES; returned only system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys), so there are no user-created databases yet. To understand what data or accounts exist we should inspect the system databases: list tables in the 'mysql' database and enumerate users. This will tell us what accounts exist and what privileges/root setup is present. We can also inspect the 'sys' database tables for helpful views.",
