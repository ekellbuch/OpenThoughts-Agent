  "analysis": "You are in a container as root in /app. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld, no mysqld process), no /root/.my.cnf, and no environment variables with credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database right now because there is no reachable server or credentials.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed and provide the necessary information. Two safe options:\n\nOption A — Use an existing database (recommended)\n- Provide connection details: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, and password — OR provide the contents of a /root/.my.cnf file (with a [client] section containing user, password, host, port). If you provide a .my.cnf I will write it to /root/.my.cnf with mode 0600 and use it to connect.\n- Also tell me the exact question (which table(s), columns, and any WHERE conditions) so I can construct the single SQL statement you require.\n- Once you provide those details I will output exactly one SQL statement inside the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) and then run it. Example of how I'll run the client if you give credentials on the command line: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"<SQL>\". Note: passwords on the command line may be visible in process listings; use a .my.cnf to avoid that.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local server in this container\n- Confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server here. If you confirm, I will:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-server (or mysql-server) and initialize it\n  3) start the server and create any user/database you request\n  4) then run the SQL you specify\n- This requires extra time and changes to the environment. Tell me whether to proceed and any username/password/database you want created.\n\nSecurity note: If you supply credentials on the command line, they can be exposed via process listings. Prefer providing a /root/.my.cnf content if you want to avoid that.\n\nWhen you reply, say which option you choose and provide the required details and the exact SQL question (table, columns, conditions). After that I will produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you specified and execute it.",
