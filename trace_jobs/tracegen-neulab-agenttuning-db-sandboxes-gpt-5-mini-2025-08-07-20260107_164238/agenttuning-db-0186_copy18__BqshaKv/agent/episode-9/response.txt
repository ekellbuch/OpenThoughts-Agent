  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql, MySQL 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/run/mysqld, no mysqld process), no /root/.my.cnf and no environment variables providing credentials. Because no reachable server or credentials are available, I cannot execute any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information. Option A (use an existing DB): provide connection details (host/IP, port if not 3306, username, and password) or supply a /root/.my.cnf content with a [client] section. Also tell me the exact question you want answered (what table(s), columns, and conditions). If you provide credentials on the command line I will use mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"<SQL>\"; if you provide a ~/.my.cnf I will write it to /root/.my.cnf (0600) and run mysql -e \"<SQL>\". Option B (start a local server here): confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server; if confirmed I will install the server packages, initialize/start the server, optionally create a user/database you specify, and then run the SQL you request. Security note: providing passwords on the command line can be visible in process listings — use a .my.cnf if you prefer to avoid that. Once you supply either (A) credentials plus the SQL question (I will then output the single required SQL statement in the exact format you requested) or (B) confirmation to install a local server plus any user/database details, I will proceed.",
