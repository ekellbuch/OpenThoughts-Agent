  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql. No local MySQL server was found earlier (no mysqld process and no common MySQL directories), so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database) and you have not asked me to install/start a local server. Therefore I cannot run any SQL or produce results yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options below and supply the requested details so I can continue.\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit about tables, columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploratory steps first, tell me which metadata you want (e.g., list tables, DESCRIBE a table, show sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to paste a password, tell me and I will give you the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization of a local server. If requested, state whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps.\n\nWhen you provide the choice and required details I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format: prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown. You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 3) I will analyze the output and iterate with further single SQL statements (one per round) until we reach the final answer. 4) When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only accounts, or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze.",
