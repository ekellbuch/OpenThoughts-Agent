  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and the container is ready to connect to a MySQL server. No MySQL server was detected locally earlier, and there are no database files in common locations. You have not yet provided the question you want answered or any connection details (host/port/user/password/database or socket). Without that information I cannot run SQL against a database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide: 1) the exact question you want answered (what table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.); and 2) MySQL connection details so I can connect and run queries. Required connection info: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, password (or you can opt to be prompted), and the database name. Optionally tell me if you want me to install and start a local MySQL server instead. Once you provide the question and connection info I will: - explain my approach and the SQL I will run; - output one SQL statement in the exact format you required (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL in a markdown code block); - you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; - I will analyze the output and iterate until we can produce the final answer. Security note: providing plaintext passwords is risky; you can instead omit the password and run the mysql client yourself when prompted, or provide temporary/throwaway credentials.",
