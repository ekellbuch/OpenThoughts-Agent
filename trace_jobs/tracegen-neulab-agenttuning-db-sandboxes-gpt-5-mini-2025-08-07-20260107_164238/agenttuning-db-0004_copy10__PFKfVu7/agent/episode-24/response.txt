  "analysis": "You are in a minimal Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The mysql client has been installed (/usr/bin/mysql). No local MySQL server was found earlier (no mysqld process and no common MySQL directories), so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Without the specific question and connection info (or explicit permission to install/start a local server here) I cannot run any SQL against a database.",
  "plan": "I will not run further shell commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit about table(s), columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, say so (e.g., list tables, describe a table, show sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you do NOT want to share a password, tell me and I will produce the exact single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n- Once you provide the question and connection info I will: (1) explain my approach, (2) output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (Action: Operation and a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute, (3) you will run it and paste the raw mysql output back, (4) I will analyze and iterate with further single SQL statements until we reach the final answer, then output Action: Answer with the final-result array.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly ask me to install and initialize a local server. If you request this, state whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), the port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this modifies the container and may require extra steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then proceed as in Option A.\n\nIf you want a quick example of how I will provide operations once you give details: I will precede the SQL with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block. Example (you should not run this unless you have an appropriate server and credentials):\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only accounts or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze.\n\nTell me which option you choose, provide the exact question (or metadata request), and either connection details or permission to install a local server. I will then produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) to execute next.",
