  "analysis": "The environment is ready to run MySQL client commands: the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no local MySQL server detected and no database files were found earlier. You have not provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/port/user/password/database or socket). Without the database location and the specific question, I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide two things: (1) the exact question you want answered (what table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.), and (2) MySQL connection details so I can connect and run queries. Required connection information: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and the database name. Optionally tell me if you want me to instantiate a local MySQL server here instead (I will only do that if you explicitly ask). Security note: avoid sharing long-term production passwords; prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the client locally and paste the output. Once you provide the question and connection info I will: - explain my approach and the single SQL statement I plan to run; - output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute; - analyze the returned raw MySQL output and iterate until we reach the final answer; - when finished, output Action: Answer with the exact final-result array.",
