At this point we can run SQL only if you provide connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port or socket, username, password, and database) or if you explicitly ask me to install and start a local server here. You have not yet provided the question you want answered or the database/table context.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please tell me: 1) the question you want answered (what data/aggregation/filters you need), and 2) the MySQL connection details (host, port, username, password — or whether to use socket, and the database name). Optionally tell me if you want me to start a local MySQL server instead. Once you provide connection details and the question, I will: - explain my approach and the SQL I plan to run; - when you want me to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue iteratively until we reach a final answer, at which point I'll output Action: Answer and the final-result array.",
