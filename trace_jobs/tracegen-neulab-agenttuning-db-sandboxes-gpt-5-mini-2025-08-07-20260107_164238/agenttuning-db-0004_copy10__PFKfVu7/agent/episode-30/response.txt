  "analysis": "The container is ready: the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt (/app) as root. Earlier checks showed there is no local MySQL server running and no database files present, so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database) and you have not asked me to install/start a local server. No SQL has been executed against a database in this session.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit: which table(s), which column(s), any WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploratory metadata first, say which (e.g., list databases, list tables in a database, describe a table, show sample rows).\n- Provide connection details so I can connect from this container: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name.\n- If you prefer not to share a password here, tell me and I will give you the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n- If you provide credentials and want me to operate, I will: (1) explain my approach for the requested question, (2) output exactly one SQL statement per round prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block (this is the statement you will run), (3) you will execute it and paste the raw mysql output back, and (4) I will analyze and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization. If you request this, tell me whether to install the distribution package (mysql-server), what port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then proceed as in Option A.\n\nIf you want to test connectivity from your side, you can run locally (will prompt for password if -p is used without value):\n- mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p -D <database> -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\nIf you ask me to run an initial exploratory query once you provide credentials, the typical first operation is SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES; (in the chosen database) to discover structure. When you are ready to proceed, tell me which option you choose and provide the exact question and connection details (or permission to install a local server). I will then produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) to execute next.",
