  "analysis": "The environment is ready: the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and the shell is at /app as root. No MySQL server was found on the system and no database files were present earlier. You have not yet provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/port/user/password/database or socket). Without the database location and the question, I cannot run any SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide two things: (1) the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits you expect), and (2) connection details so I can connect to the MySQL server. Required connection details: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name. Optionally tell me if you want me to install and start a local MySQL server instead. Once you provide the above, I will: - Explain my approach to answer the question and the exact single SQL statement I will run. - Output that statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). - You will run it and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and, if needed, issue the next single SQL statement. When finished I will produce Action: Answer with the final result array.",
