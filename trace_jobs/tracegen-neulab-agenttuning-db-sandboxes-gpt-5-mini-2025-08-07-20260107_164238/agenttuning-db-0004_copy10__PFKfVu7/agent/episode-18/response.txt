  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed at /usr/bin/mysql and you are at a shell prompt as root in /app. Earlier checks showed no local mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided the exact question you want answered against a database, nor any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database). Without the question and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options below and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about table(s), columns, filters, aggregates, ordering, and limits).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name.\n- If you do NOT want to share a password, say so; I will produce a single-line SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use default package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this modifies the container and may require additional steps.\n\nWhen you provide the choice and the required details I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question.\n2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format: prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown. You will execute that SQL and paste the raw mysql output back.\n3) I will analyze the output and iterate with further single SQL statements (one per round) until we reach the final answer.\n4) When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.\n\nNotes and helpful client commands you can run locally to test connectivity (will prompt for password if -p used without value):\n- mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n- If you want me to run queries directly from this container, provide the connection details above. Avoid pasting long-lived production passwords here; prefer temporary or read-only credentials if possible.",
