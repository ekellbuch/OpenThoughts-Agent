  "analysis": "You are in a container with the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and a ready shell prompt at /app as root. Previous checks showed no local MySQL server process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is no local database to query from this container. You have not provided (1) the exact database question to answer, nor (2) any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database) or explicit permission to install and run a local server. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please choose one of the following and supply the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about table(s), columns, filters/WHERE, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, ask for metadata (list tables, describe table, sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will produce the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then I will proceed.\n\nWhen you provide the choice and the required details I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown). You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 3) I will analyze the output and iterate with further single SQL statements (one per round) until we reach the final answer. 4) When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only accounts or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze.",
