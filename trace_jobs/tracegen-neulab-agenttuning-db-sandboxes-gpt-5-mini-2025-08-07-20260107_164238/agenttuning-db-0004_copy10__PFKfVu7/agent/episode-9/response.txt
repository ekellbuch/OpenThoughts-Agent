  "analysis": "The environment is ready: the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and you're at a shell prompt as root in /app. No local MySQL server or database files were detected earlier, so there is no local database to query. You have not provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database). Without the question and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run SQL against a database.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you choose one of these options and provide details: 1) Query an existing remote MySQL server — provide the exact question (what you want from the DB) and connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or state you'll be prompted), and database name. After you provide that I will:   - explain my approach to answer the question,   - produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required SQL markdown block (Action: Operation) for you to execute,   - you'll run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, and   - I'll analyze and iterate with further single SQL statements until I can produce the final answer. 2) Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here — explicitly ask me to install and initialize a server; if you request that I will install, initialize, and start it and then proceed as above (you may need to provide data or allow me to create sample tables). 3) If you prefer not to share passwords, you can run the mysql client locally and paste the raw output; in that case tell me the question and I will produce the single-line SQL you should run. Security note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials; prefer temporary or read-only accounts. Tell me which option you choose and provide the required details and the exact question you want answered, and I will proceed.",
