  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed at /usr/bin/mysql and you are at a shell prompt (/app) as root. Earlier checks showed no local MySQL server process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided the exact question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Without the question and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, and limits).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name.\n- If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will give you the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back.\n\nWhen you provide the question and connection info I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format: prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown. You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 3) I will analyze the output and iterate with further single SQL statements until we reach the final answer. 4) When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, I will install, initialize, and start it and then you can provide or allow me to create/load data to query. Note: this modifies the container and may require me to set a root password or you to provide data.\n\nSecurity note: Do not share long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs. Example client commands you can run locally:\n- Prompt for password: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n- Non-interactive (less secure): mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'PASSWORD' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose, the exact question to answer, and either the connection details or permission to install a local server. Once provided, I will produce the single SQL statement for you to execute next.",
