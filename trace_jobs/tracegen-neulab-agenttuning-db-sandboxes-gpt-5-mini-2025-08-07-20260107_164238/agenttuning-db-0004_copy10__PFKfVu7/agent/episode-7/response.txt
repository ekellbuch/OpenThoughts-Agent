  "analysis": "The environment has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). No local MySQL server or data directories were found earlier, so there is no local database to query. You have not provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL server connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database). Without that information I cannot run SQL against a database.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me how to proceed. Please provide: 1) the exact question you want answered (what table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits, etc.); and 2) MySQL connection details so I can connect and run queries — either a remote server (host, port, username, password, database) or a socket path and credentials. Alternatively, tell me to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here (I will only do that if you explicitly request it). Once you provide the question and connection info I will: - explain my approach and the exact single SQL statement I plan to run; - output that statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block); - you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; - I will analyze the output and, if needed, issue the next single SQL statement, iterating until we produce the final answer. If you choose to give credentials, consider using temporary or read-only credentials or run the client locally and paste the output for security.",
