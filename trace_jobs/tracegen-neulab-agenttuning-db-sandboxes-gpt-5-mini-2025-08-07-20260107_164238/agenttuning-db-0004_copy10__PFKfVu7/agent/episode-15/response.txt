  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt (/app) as root. There is no local MySQL server process detected and no MySQL data/config directories were present earlier, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided the exact question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Without the database location and the query requirement I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, and limits).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name.\n- If you prefer not to share a password, tell me and I will produce a single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nIf you choose Option A, I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question.\n2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format: prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown. You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 3) I will analyze the output and iterate (one SQL statement per round) until we reach the final answer, at which point I will output \"Action: Answer\" and the final-result array.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request this if you want a local server. If you request it I will install and initialize a server and then proceed to create or load data as you instruct.\n- Installing/starting a local server will modify the container and may require additional steps (setting root password, binding socket/port, creating databases). If you pick this, tell me whether to use default package mysql-server and whether to set a root password and which port to bind.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only accounts, or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze.\n\nExamples (for your use if you will run commands locally):\n- Test connection (prompts for password): mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n- Non-interactive (not recommended to paste long-lived passwords in chat): mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'PASSWORD' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n\nWhen you reply, tell me which option you choose and provide the exact question and either the connection details or permission to install a local server. After that I'll produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) to execute next.",
