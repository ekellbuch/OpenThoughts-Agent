  "analysis": "I am at a shell prompt in /app as root. No commands have been run yet in this session (besides the shell startup messages). The task description says you'll ask a question about a MySQL database and I should help operate it with SQL, but no question or database context has been provided yet. Before issuing any SQL, I should discover whether MySQL (server or client) is present, whether a server is running, and where database files/sockets/configuration are located so I can craft appropriate SQL to run. Currently nothing has been accomplished toward that discovery.",
  "plan": "I'll gather basic environment and MySQL-related information so we can decide how to connect and what SQL to run. Specifically I will: 1) confirm current directory and user; 2) list files in /app; 3) check for MySQL client binary; 4) check for MySQL server process; 5) check for open port 3306; 6) list common MySQL directories (/etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql) to find sockets/configs. These commands will let us know whether we can run the mysql client locally or need different connection details. I will not attempt to modify anything yet.",
