  "analysis": "The mysql client has now been installed successfully (mysql Ver 8.0.44). There is still no MySQL server information available: no local mysqld was found earlier and no MySQL directories existed. To run SQL I need connection details for a MySQL server (host, port or socket, username, password, and database) or your permission to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this environment. No question or target table/database has been provided yet.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm the mysql client binary location. 2) Ask you to provide the database connection details and the question you want answered. 3) Once you provide connection info and the question, I will:   - explain my approach,   - produce a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block (the one SQL statement you will execute),   - run iterative SQL operations as needed, one statement at a time, until we can assemble the final answer. 4) If you prefer a local server instead, I can install and start one (I will only do that if you explicitly ask). Example connect/test command I'll use once you give credentials: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\" (or omit password to be prompted).",
