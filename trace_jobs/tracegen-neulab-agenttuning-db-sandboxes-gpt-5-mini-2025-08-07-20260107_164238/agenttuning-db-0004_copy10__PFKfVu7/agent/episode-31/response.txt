  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). Earlier checks showed no local MySQL server process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database to query from this container. No database question or connection details have been provided by you, and I have not executed any SQL against a server because there is nothing to connect to yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how to proceed. Choose one of the two options below and provide the requested information so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit about tables, columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploratory steps first, say which metadata you want (e.g., SHOW DATABASES, SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE table_name, SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10).\n- Provide connection details so I can run queries from this container: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password here, say so and I will output the exact single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then I will proceed.\n\nIf you choose Option A and want an initial exploratory query, typical first statements are:\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES; (after selecting a database)\n- DESCRIBE table_name;\n- SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;\n\nIf you will run commands locally instead of sharing credentials, tell me which of the above you want and I will produce the single-line SQL in the required format (Action: Operation) for you to execute and paste back the raw MySQL output.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production passwords here; prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs.",
