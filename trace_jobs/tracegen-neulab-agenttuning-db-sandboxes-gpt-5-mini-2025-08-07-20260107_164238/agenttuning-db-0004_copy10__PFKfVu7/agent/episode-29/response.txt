  "analysis": "The container is ready: the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and you are at a shell prompt (/app) as root. There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories were found earlier), so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database), nor have you asked me to install and start a local server. No SQL has been executed against a database in this session.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please choose one of the two options and provide the requested information:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit about table(s), columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, say which metadata you want (e.g., SHOW DATABASES, SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE table_name, SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10).\n- Provide connection details so I can connect from this container: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password here, tell me and I will produce the exact single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization of a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and provide its value). Note: this will modify the container and may require initialization steps.\n\nOnce you choose and provide the necessary details I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer your question. 2) Provide exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" (a markdown SQL code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. 3) I will analyze the output and, if needed, provide the next single SQL statement. 4) When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials here. Prefer temporary or read-only credentials, or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze if you don't want to share passwords.",
