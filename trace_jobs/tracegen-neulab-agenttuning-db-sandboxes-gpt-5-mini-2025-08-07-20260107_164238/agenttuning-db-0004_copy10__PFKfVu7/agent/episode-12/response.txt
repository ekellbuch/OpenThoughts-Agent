  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you're at a shell prompt as root in /app. Earlier checks found no local MySQL server process and no database files in common locations, so there is no local database to query. You have not provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Without the question and connection information (or permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and supply the required information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name.\n- If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will produce the single-line SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, I will install and start it and then you can provide data or tables to query.\n\nOnce you provide the question and connection choice I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required SQL markdown block prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" for you to execute. 3) You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 4) I will analyze the output and, if needed, provide the next single SQL statement. When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final answer array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials; prefer temporary or read-only accounts or run the client locally and paste outputs.",
