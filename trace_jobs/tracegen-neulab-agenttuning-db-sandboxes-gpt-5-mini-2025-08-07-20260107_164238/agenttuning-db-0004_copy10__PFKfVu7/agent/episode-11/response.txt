  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you're at a ready shell prompt as root in /app. No local MySQL server or database files were detected earlier, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided: (1) the exact question you want answered against a database (what table(s)/columns/filters/aggregations you need), nor (2) any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, and database). Without the question and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here), I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details so I can proceed: \n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question (be specific about tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you will be prompted), and database name. \n- If you prefer not to share a password, tell me and I will supply the exact single-line SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation/start of a server. If you request this, I will install, initialize, and start a local server and then proceed (note: this modifies the container and may require creating/loading data).\n\nOnce you provide the question and connection choice, I will: (1) explain my approach, (2) produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required SQL markdown block prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" for you to execute, (3) you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, and (4) I will analyze and iterate with further single SQL statements until we reach the final answer. When finished I will output \"Action: Answer\" with the final answer array.\n\nSecurity note: prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs rather than sharing long-lived secrets.",
