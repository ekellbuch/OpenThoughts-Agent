  "analysis": "The environment is ready: the mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and the shell prompt is at /app as root. No local MySQL server or database files were detected earlier, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided (1) the exact question you want answered against the database, nor (2) any MySQL connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database). Without the question and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here), I cannot run any SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- You supply the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits). Be as specific as possible.\n- You supply connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to paste a password, tell me and I will give you the single-line SQL to run locally and you can paste the raw mysql output.\n- Once you provide the question and connection info, I will: (1) explain my approach, (2) produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required SQL markdown block with the prefix \"Action: Operation\" for you to execute, (3) you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, and (4) I will analyze that output and iterate with further single statements until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server here:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server. If you ask, I will install packages, initialize, and start a local server, then we can create or load data per your instructions. Note: this will modify the container and may require you to provide or allow me to create data.\n\nSecurity note: Do not share long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only accounts. If you prefer, you can run the mysql commands locally and paste their raw outputs here; I will analyze them and instruct next steps.\n\nWhen you reply, tell me which option you choose and provide the question and necessary connection details (or request local server installation). After that I will produce the single SQL statement to execute in the required format.",
