  "analysis": "You are in a minimal Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The mysql client is installed and available at /usr/bin/mysql. No local MySQL server was detected earlier (no mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories), so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not provided (1) the exact question you want answered against a database, nor (2) any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database), nor (3) permission to install and start a local server here. Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL statements yet.",
  "plan": "Tell me how you want to proceed by choosing one of the options below and providing the requested details. After you reply I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) in the required format for you to execute; you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, and I will analyze and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit about table(s), columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, request metadata (list tables, DESCRIBE table, show sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or specify you'll be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will give you the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this modifies the container and may require additional steps.\n\nIf you want exploratory metadata first, tell me which of these you'd like me to ask for with a single SQL statement:\n- List databases (SHOW DATABASES;)\n- List tables in a database (SHOW TABLES;)\n- Describe a table schema (DESCRIBE table_name;)\n- Show a few sample rows (SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;)\n\nImportant: when you want me to run a query, I will produce exactly one SQL statement per round, prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and including a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown SQL code block (this is the statement you must execute). Example (do not run unless you have correct connection details):\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\nProvide your choice (A or B), the exact question or which metadata query to run first, and the connection details (or permission to install a local server). I will then produce the one SQL statement to execute next.",
