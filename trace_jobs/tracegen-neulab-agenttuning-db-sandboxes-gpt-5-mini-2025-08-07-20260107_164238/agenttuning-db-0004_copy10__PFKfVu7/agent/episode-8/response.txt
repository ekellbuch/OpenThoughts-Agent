  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed at /usr/bin/mysql and is at a ready shell prompt (/app) as root. No local MySQL server or database files were detected earlier, so there is currently no database to query locally. You have not provided the question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host/port or socket, username, password, database). Without the question and connection information (or permission to install and start a local server), I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details: 1) Query an existing remote MySQL server: provide the exact question (what you want from the DB) and connection details — host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name. 2) Query a local server: explicitly request that I install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server here; if you choose this I will install, initialize, start it, and then create or load data as you instruct. 3) If you prefer not to share passwords, you can run mysql locally and paste the raw output; in that case provide the SQL question and I'll produce the single-line SQL statement you must execute. Guidance and examples I will use once you provide details: - Example connect/test: mysql -h host -P 3306 -u user -p'DB_PASSWORD' -D database -e \"SELECT 1;\" - If you want me to run queries directly, I will: (a) explain my approach; (b) output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block); (c) you will execute it and paste the raw mysql output back; (d) I will analyze and iterate until we reach the final answer. Security note: prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the client locally and paste outputs rather than sharing long-lived secrets.",
