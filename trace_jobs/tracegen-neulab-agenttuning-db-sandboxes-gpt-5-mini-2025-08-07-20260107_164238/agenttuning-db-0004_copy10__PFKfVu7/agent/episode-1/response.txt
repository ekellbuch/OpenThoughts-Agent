  "analysis": "You're in a minimal container at /app as root. There is no MySQL client binary installed (mysql: command not found). No mysqld process is running, and common MySQL directories (/etc/mysql, /var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql) are absent. The environment currently cannot run SQL because the client is missing and no local server is present. Before I can execute SQL statements against a MySQL server I either need a MySQL client installed and a reachable server (local or remote) or connection details to a remote server. No question or database details have been provided yet by you.",
  "plan": "1) Detect the OS to choose appropriate package names. 2) Try to install a MySQL-compatible client (default-mysql-client) so we can connect to a server if one exists or to be able to run SQL when you provide connection details. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed. After that I'll ask you for the MySQL server host/port/user/password and the question you want answered, or if you want me to spin up a local server (which I will only do if you request it). Expected results: cat /etc/os-release will reveal the distribution, apt-get update and apt-get install will attempt to install the client, and mysql --version will confirm installation.",
