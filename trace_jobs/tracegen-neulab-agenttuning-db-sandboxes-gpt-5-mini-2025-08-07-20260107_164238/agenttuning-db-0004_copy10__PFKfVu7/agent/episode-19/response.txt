  "analysis": "The container is ready: the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt in /app as root. Earlier checks found no local MySQL server process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not yet provided the exact question you want answered nor any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database). Without the query and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run any SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how you want to proceed and provide the required details. Please pick one of the two options below and supply the requested information so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about which table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, and limits). Example: \"List the top 5 customers by total_amount from table orders for 2024, returning customer_id and total_amount.\"  \n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will produce the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n- If you provide credentials I will: (1) explain my approach; (2) output exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; (3) you will run that single statement and paste the raw MySQL output back; (4) I will analyze and iterate with further single statements until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password and its value. Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps (initialization, setting root password). After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then I will proceed as in Option A.\n\nIf you choose Option A but prefer not to share a password, I will give you one SQL statement to run locally. Example of the local command you would run (it will prompt for the password if -p is used without a value):\n- mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p -D <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nNotes and requirements for the question: be explicit about table names, column names (or say \"SELECT *\"), any WHERE conditions, GROUP BY or aggregates, ORDER BY, and LIMIT. If you want exploration first (e.g., list tables, sample rows, column types), tell me that and I will supply the exact single SQL statement to run to obtain that metadata.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs rather than giving passwords here.\n\nWhen you reply, include: 1) which option you choose; 2) the exact question (or which metadata you want first); and 3) connection details or permission to install a local server. I will then explain my approach and produce the single SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) to execute next.",
