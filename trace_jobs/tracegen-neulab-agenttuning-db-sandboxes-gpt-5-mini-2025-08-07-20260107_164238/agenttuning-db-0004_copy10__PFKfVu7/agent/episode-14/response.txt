  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt in /app as root. There is no local MySQL server detected and no database files were found earlier. You have not provided the database question to answer, nor any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database). Without the question and connection info (or explicit permission to install a local server here), I cannot run any SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about table(s), columns, filters, aggregations, ordering, limits). Example: \"Find the top 5 customers by total_orders in table orders grouped by customer_id for 2024.\"  \n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you'll be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, tell me and I will give you the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n- Example client command you can run locally if you want to test connectivity (will prompt for password if -p is used without value):\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p -D <database> -e \"SELECT 1;\"\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server. If you request this I will install and start it and then you can instruct me to create or load data to query. (Note: this changes the container state.)\n\nWhen you provide the question and either the connection details or the instruction to install a local server, I will:\n1) Explain my approach and the exact single-line SQL I plan to run. 2) Output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block). 3) You will execute that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 4) I will analyze the output and, if needed, produce the next single SQL statement. When finished I will output Action: Answer with the final-result array.\n\nSecurity note: prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the client locally and paste outputs rather than sharing long-lived production passwords.",
