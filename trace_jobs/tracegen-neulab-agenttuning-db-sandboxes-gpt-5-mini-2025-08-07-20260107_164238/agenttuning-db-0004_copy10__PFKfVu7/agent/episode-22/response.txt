  "analysis": "The shell is ready at /app as root and the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). Previous checks showed no local mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is no local database available in this container. You have not provided the exact question to answer against a database, nor any connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database) or explicit permission to install a local server. Therefore I cannot run any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about table(s), columns, filters/WHERE, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, ask for metadata (list tables, describe a table, sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, tell me and I will produce the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request that I install and initialize a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this modifies the container and may require additional steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then I will proceed.\n\nWhen you reply, include: 1) which option you choose, 2) the exact question or the metadata query you want first, and 3) either the connection details or permission to install a local server. After that I will: (a) explain my approach; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; (c) you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back; (d) I will analyze and iterate until we reach the final answer and then output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.",
