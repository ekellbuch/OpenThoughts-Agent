  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt (/app) as root. Earlier checks showed no local MySQL server process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Without the query and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these you want to do and provide the required details: 1) Query an existing MySQL server (recommended): provide the exact question (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits) and connection details (host or socket path, port if not 3306, username, password or indicate you'll be prompted, and database name). If you don't want to share a password, I will produce the single-line SQL for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back. 2) Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container: explicitly request installation and initialization and indicate desired root/password and any data to create or load. Once you provide the choice, connection info (or permission to install), and the exact question, I will: - explain my approach to answer the question, - produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, - you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, - I will analyze and iterate with further single SQL statements until we reach the final answer, then output Action: Answer with the final-result array.",
