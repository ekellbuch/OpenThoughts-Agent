  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt in /app as root. No local MySQL server process or MySQL data/config directories were found earlier, so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database). Without the query and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run any SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of these options and supply the requested details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about which table(s), columns, filters/WHERE, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, ask for metadata (list tables, describe table, sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, tell me and I will give you the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization of a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps.\n\nAfter you choose and provide the question and either connection details or permission to install a local server, I will:\n1) Explain my approach to answer the question. 2) Produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (prefix \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute. 3) You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 4) I will analyze the output and iterate with further single SQL statements (one per round) until we reach the final answer, then output \"Action: Answer\" with the final-result array.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials; prefer temporary or read-only accounts or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs.",
