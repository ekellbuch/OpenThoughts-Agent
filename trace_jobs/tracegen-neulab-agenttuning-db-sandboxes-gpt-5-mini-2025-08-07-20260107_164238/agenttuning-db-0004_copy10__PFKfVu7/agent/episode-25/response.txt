  "analysis": "You are in a Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). Earlier checks found no local mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database to query from this container. You have not provided the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database) and you have not asked me to install/start a local server. Without the query and connection information (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run any SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "Tell me how you want to proceed by choosing one of the options below and supplying the requested details. After you reply I will explain my approach and produce a single SQL statement (one-line) in the required format (Action: Operation with a markdown SQL code block) for you to execute; you will run it and paste back the raw MySQL output, and I will analyze and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be explicit about table(s), columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, ask for metadata (e.g., list tables, describe a table, sample rows).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will give you the single-line SQL for you to run locally and paste the raw output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization of a local server. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this modifies the container and may require additional steps.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze.",
