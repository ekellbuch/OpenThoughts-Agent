  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and you are at a shell prompt in /app as root. No local MySQL server or database files were detected earlier, so there is currently no local database to query. You have not provided: (1) the exact question you want answered (what tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits), nor (2) any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database). Without the question and connection info (or explicit permission to install and start a local server here) I cannot run SQL or produce results.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do and provide required details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific about tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits).\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you'll be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will produce the single-line SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request I install and initialize a local server. If requested, I will install and start it and then you can provide or allow me to create/load data to query.\n\nOnce you choose and provide the question and connection choice I will:\n1) Explain my approach and show the exact single SQL statement I will run. 2) Output that SQL in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL code block). 3) You will execute that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output. 4) I will analyze the output and iterate (one SQL statement per round) until we produce the final answer; then I will output Action: Answer with the final-result array.\n\nSecurity note: Prefer temporary or read-only credentials or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs rather than sharing long-lived production passwords.",
