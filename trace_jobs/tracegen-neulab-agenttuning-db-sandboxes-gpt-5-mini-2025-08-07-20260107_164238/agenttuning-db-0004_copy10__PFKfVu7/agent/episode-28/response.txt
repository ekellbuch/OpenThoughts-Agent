  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app as root. The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). Earlier checks showed no local mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is currently no local database in this container. I have not been given the exact question to answer nor any MySQL connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database) and you have not asked me to install/start a local server. No SQL has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested information.\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Tell me the exact question you want answered (be explicit about table(s), columns, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, say which metadata you want (e.g., list tables, describe a table, sample rows).\n- Provide connection details so I (or you locally) can run queries: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to paste a password, say so and I will give you the exact single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw mysql output back here.\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization. If you request this, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and its value). Note this will modify the container and may require additional steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data to query.\n\nHow I will operate once you provide details:\n- I will explain my approach for the requested question.\n- For each operation I perform, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n  Action: Operation\n  ```sql\n  <single-line SQL statement>;\n  ```\n  (You will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze it and, if needed, issue the next single SQL statement.)\n- When we've obtained the needed data and I am ready to finalize, I will output:\n  Action: Answer\n  Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nRequired from you now: pick Option A or B, provide the exact question (or the metadata query you want first), and either the connection details or permission to install a local server. If you choose Option A and prefer not to share the password, tell me and I will give you the single-line SQL to run locally.",
