  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt in /app as root. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). Earlier checks found no local mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is no local database available in this container. No database question, schema, or connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database) have been provided. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "Tell me how you want to proceed by choosing one of these two options and providing the required information. After you reply I will (1) explain the specific SQL I will run and why, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement per round in the required format (prefixed with \"Action: Operation\" and a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block) for you to execute and paste back the raw mysql output.\n\nOption A — Query an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (be specific: which table(s), which column(s), any WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregates, ORDER BY, LIMIT). If you want exploration first, say which metadata you want (examples below).\n- Provide connection details so I can run queries from this container: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will provide the single-line SQL (in the required format) for you to run locally and paste the raw output here.\n- Typical initial exploratory statements: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE table_name; SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;\n\nOption B — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container:\n- Explicitly request installation and initialization. If requested, tell me whether to use the distribution package (mysql-server), which port to bind, and whether to set a root password (and provide it). Note this will modify the container and may require extra steps. After the server is up you can provide or ask me to create/load data and then proceed as in Option A.\n\nSecurity note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials. Prefer temporary or read-only accounts, or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs for me to analyze.\n\nWhen you reply, include:\n1) Which option (A or B) you choose.\n2) The exact question to answer (or the metadata query you want first).\n3) If Option A: the connection details (host/socket, port if not 3306, username, password or indicate you'll be prompted, and database). If Option B: confirm you want a local server and provide root password choice and port.\n\nOnce you provide that, I will produce the first single SQL statement (Action: Operation) to run.",
