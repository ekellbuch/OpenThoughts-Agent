  "analysis": "You are in a container at /app as root and the mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). Earlier checks found no mysqld process and no MySQL data/config directories, so there is no local database to query from this container. You have not provided: (1) the exact question you want answered (which tables/columns/filters/aggregations/order/limits), nor (2) any MySQL connection details (host or socket, port, username, password, database) or explicit permission to install and start a local server. Because of that, I cannot run any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "To proceed I need you to choose one of two options and provide details: 1) Query an existing MySQL server (recommended): • Provide the exact question (be explicit about tables/columns/WHERE/GROUP BY/ORDER BY/LIMIT). • Provide connection details: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or say you will be prompted), and database name. If you prefer not to share a password, say so and I will give you the single-line SQL to run locally and you can paste the raw mysql output back here. 2) Start a local MySQL server in this container: • Explicitly request installation and initialization of a local server and provide desired root password (or say none) and port. Note this modifies the container and may require additional steps. When you provide the choice and required details I will: A) explain my approach to answer your question, B) produce exactly one SQL statement (single-line) inside the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute, C) you will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, and D) I will analyze and iterate (one SQL statement per round) until we reach the final answer, then output Action: Answer with the final-result array. Security note: avoid sharing long-lived production credentials; prefer temporary or read-only accounts or run the mysql client locally and paste outputs.",
