  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no evidence of a running local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld found earlier) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection info. No SQL has been executed because no target database connection was provided. I cannot run SQL until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL instance (host, port, user, password, database) and the question to answer, or (B) explicitly allow me to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice. Please choose one of the two options: \n\nOption A (connect to existing DB): Reply with connection details and the question in this exact format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You must run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B (install local server): Reply 'install local server' to let me install and configure MySQL server here. If you choose that, I will (1) install mysql-server via apt, (2) initialize/start the server, (3) create a user/database or set root password, and (4) run SQL as you request. I will show the exact commands before executing and proceed only after you confirm.\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials, you can run the SQL I provide locally and paste the output back. State your choice and (if Option A) provide the connection details and the question.",
