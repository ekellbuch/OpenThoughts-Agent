There is no evidence of a running local MySQL server (previous checks found no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables containing connection details. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installation of a local MySQL server in this container. I am blocked from proceeding until you make a single explicit choice: provide DB connection details and the question, or permit installation of a local server.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to reply with exactly one of the two options: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB: reply on a single line in this exact format:\nhost=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server here: reply exactly:\ninstall local server\n\nAfter you reply:\n- If Option A: I will produce exactly one SQL statement (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to run; you will execute only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. I will parse the output and continue with the next single SQL or return the final answer when appropriate.\n- If Option B: I will show the exact apt/install/start commands I plan to run to install and initialize MySQL server here and will proceed only after you explicitly confirm.\nI will not install software or run SQL until you explicitly choose one of these two options and provide any required connection details.",
