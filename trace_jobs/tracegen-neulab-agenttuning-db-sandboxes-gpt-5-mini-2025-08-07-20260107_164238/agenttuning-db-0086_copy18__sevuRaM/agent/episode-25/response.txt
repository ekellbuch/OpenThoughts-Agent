No SQL has been executed because you have not provided target database connection details and you have not permitted installing a local server.

You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container: reply exactly: install local server\n- If you choose this, I will show the exact apt/install/start commands I plan to run and will proceed only after you confirm. I will adapt startup to this environment if systemd is not available.\n\nI will not install software or run SQL until you explicitly reply with one of these two options. Below I print a concise prompt to the terminal so you can provide your choice.",
