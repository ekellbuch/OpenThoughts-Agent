There is no evidence of a local MySQL server and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection info. No SQL statements have been executed. To proceed I need the target database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) and the specific question you want answered with SQL. Alternatively, if you want me to operate on a local server, tell me and I can install and configure one, but that will modify the container environment.",
  "plan": "1) Ask you to provide the DB connection details and the exact question you want answered (or the table/schema to query). Provide details in this format: host, port, user, password, database, and the question (e.g., \"List top 5 customers by total spent\"). 2) Once you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in a single-line markdown code block) preceded by \"Action: Operation\" as required. You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back. 3) I will parse the output and either produce the next single SQL statement or, when finished, return the final answer with \"Action: Answer\" and Final Answer: [\"...\"] exactly. Note: if you prefer not to share a password here, you can run the SQL I provide locally using your mysql client and paste the results back.",
