Earlier checks showed no local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection info. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installing a local server. I'm blocked from proceeding until you explicitly choose one of two options: (A) provide DB connection details and the question to run, or (B) permit installation of a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "Ask you to make a single explicit choice so I can continue. Two options (pick exactly one):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB: reply on a single line in this exact format:\nhost=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container: reply exactly:\ninstall local server\n\nIf you choose Option A and provide the connection details and question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute; you will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back and I will parse it and continue. If you choose Option B I will show the exact apt/install/start commands I will run and proceed only after you confirm. I will not install or run any SQL until you explicitly reply with one of the two options.",
