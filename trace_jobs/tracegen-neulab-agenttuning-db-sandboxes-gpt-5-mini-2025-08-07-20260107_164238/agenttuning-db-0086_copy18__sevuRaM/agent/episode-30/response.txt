  "analysis": "The MySQL client is installed and verified (/usr/bin/mysql, mysql Ver 8.0.44). Earlier checks showed no local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installing a local server. I am blocked from proceeding until you explicitly choose one of two options: provide DB connection details and the question to run, or permit installation of a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your explicit choice. Two possible paths:\n\nOption A (connect to existing DB): You reply in this exact single-line format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted as required: 'Action: Operation' then a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B (install local server): Reply exactly: install local server\n- If you permit, I will run a prepared sequence to install and initialize MySQL server here. Planned commands (I will show and run only after you confirm):\n  1) apt-get update -y\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) initialize/start mysqld (use mysqld_safe or direct mysqld if systemd unavailable)\n  4) secure root / create a user and database per your instructions\n  After that I will verify the server is running and then accept your SQL questions, issuing exactly one SQL statement per round as required.\n\nI will not install or start any server and I will not run any SQL until you explicitly reply with either Option A (with details) or Option B (the exact phrase).",
