There is no local MySQL server detected (previous checks showed no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL has been executed because you have not supplied connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installation of a local server. I am blocked until you choose how to proceed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options. Once you reply I will act as described:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB (preferred if you have a running server):\n- Reply with connection details AND the question in this exact single-line format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted as required: start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide the next single SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container (I will modify the environment):\n- Reply exactly: install local server\n- If you choose this, I will show the exact apt and initialization commands I plan to run (apt-get install mysql-server, initialize/start mysqld, create/set user/database) and proceed only after you explicitly confirm. Note: systemd may not be available, so I will adapt by starting mysqld directly if needed.\n\nI will not install or run any SQL until you explicitly choose one option. Below I print a short prompt to make your choice.",
