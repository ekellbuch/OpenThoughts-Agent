  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no evidence of a running local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld were found earlier) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection info. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided target database connection details and you have not authorized installing a local server. I cannot run SQL until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL instance (host, port, user, password, database) along with the question to answer, or (B) explicitly permit me to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "Wait for your explicit choice. Provide one of the following:\n- Option A (connect to existing DB): Reply with connection details in this exact format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n  After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (preceded by 'Action: Operation' and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back.\n- Option B (install local server): Reply 'install local server' to grant permission. If you choose this, I will run apt-get install mysql-server, initialize/start the server, create/set credentials, and then proceed to run SQL. I will show the exact commands I will run before executing and proceed only after your confirmation.\nI will not proceed with installing a server or running SQL until you explicitly choose one of the above options. Below I emit a short prompt so you can make that choice.",
