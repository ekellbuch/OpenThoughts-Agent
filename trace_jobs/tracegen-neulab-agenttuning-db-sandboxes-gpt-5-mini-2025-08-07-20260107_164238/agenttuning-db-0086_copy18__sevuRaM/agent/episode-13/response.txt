  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server detected (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld were found earlier) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL statements have been executed because you have not yet provided target database connection details and you have not authorized installing a local server. I'm waiting for you to choose one of two options: (A) provide connection details for an existing MySQL instance and the question to run, or (B) explicitly permit installing and configuring a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "Do not proceed with changes until you explicitly choose. Please reply with one of the following:\n\n- Option A (connect to existing DB): Provide connection details in this exact format on a single line: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n  After you provide those details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted as: Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\n- Option B (install local server): Reply exactly: install local server\n  If you choose this, I will run a prepared sequence to install and initialize a MySQL server here. Because systemd may not be available in this environment, I will adapt by installing the server package and starting the server directly (I will show the exact commands I will run before executing). I will only perform those installation steps after you explicitly confirm.\n\nWhile you decide, I will not install or start any server and I will not run any SQL. Below I print a short prompt so you can provide your choice.",
