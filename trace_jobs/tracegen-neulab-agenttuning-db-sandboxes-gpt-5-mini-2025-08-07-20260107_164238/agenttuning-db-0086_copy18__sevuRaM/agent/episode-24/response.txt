No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installation of a local server. Progress cannot continue until you choose one of two options.",

Option A: provide connection details for an existing MySQL instance and the question to run in the exact single-line format (host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'). Option B: reply exactly 'install local server' to permit me to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container. I will not install or run anything until you explicitly reply with one of these options. After your reply I will either (A) produce a single SQL statement (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute or (B) show the exact install/start commands and proceed only after your confirmation.",
