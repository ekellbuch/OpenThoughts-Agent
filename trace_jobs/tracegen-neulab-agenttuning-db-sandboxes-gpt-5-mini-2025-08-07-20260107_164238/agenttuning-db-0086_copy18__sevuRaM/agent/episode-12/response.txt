I will then produce a single SQL statement (formatted as required) for you to execute and will parse the returned MySQL output. If you choose Option B (reply 'install local server'), I will: (1) install mysql-server via apt, (2) initialize and start the server, (3) create or set up a database and user as needed, and (4) then run SQL statements you request. I will show exact commands for installation and initialization before executing them. I will not proceed with installation without your confirmation.",
