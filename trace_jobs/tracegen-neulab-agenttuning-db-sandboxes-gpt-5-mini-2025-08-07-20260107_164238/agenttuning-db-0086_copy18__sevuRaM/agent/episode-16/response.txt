There is no running local MySQL server detected earlier (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and no MYSQL_* environment variables contain connection info. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installing a local server. I cannot run any SQL yet without either (A) connection details for a target MySQL instance or (B) explicit permission to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container.",

Give them in this exact single-line format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n  After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a Markdown code block) for you to run; you will paste back the raw MySQL output and I'll continue.\n- Option B: You reply exactly 'install local server' to permit me to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container. If chosen, I will show the exact apt/install/start commands I will run and proceed only after you confirm.\nI will not install or start any server and I will not execute SQL until you explicitly choose one of the above. The following command prints this prompt in the container.",
