  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no evidence of a running local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld found earlier) and no MYSQL_* environment variables containing connection details. No SQL has been executed because no target database connection was provided. I cannot run SQL until you either (A) give connection details for an existing MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) explicitly allow me to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice. Provide one of the following: \n\n- Option A (connect to existing DB): reply with connection details and the question to run, in this format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n  After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted as required: 'Action: Operation' followed by a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute, and you will paste the raw MySQL output back.\n\n- Option B (install local server): reply 'install local server' to give me permission to install and initialize MySQL server here. If you choose this, I will: (1) install mysql-server via apt, (2) initialize/start the service, (3) secure/set a root password or create a dedicated user/database, and (4) then run SQL statements as you request. I will show each command I plan to run before executing and proceed only after your confirmation.\n\nI will not proceed with installing a server or running SQL until you explicitly choose one of the above options. Below I emit a short prompt command to the terminal to ask you to decide.",
