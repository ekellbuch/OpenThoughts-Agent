No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installing a local server. I'm currently waiting for you to choose one of two options so I can proceed.",
  "plan": "Wait for your explicit choice. You must choose one of the two options: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB (preferred if you have a running server):\n- Reply with connection details and the question in this exact single-line format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute; you will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back, which I will parse and continue.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server here (this will modify the container):\n- Reply exactly: install local server\n- If you choose this, I will present the exact apt/install/start commands I will run and will proceed only after you confirm. I will adapt service startup if systemd is unavailable by starting mysqld directly.\n\nI will not install or start any server and I will not run SQL until you explicitly choose one of the above options.",
