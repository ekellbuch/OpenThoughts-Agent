Please choose one of the following so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB: provide connection details and the question in this exact single-line format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\nAfter you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and containing a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to run; you will paste the raw MySQL output back and I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container: reply exactly 'install local server' to grant permission. If you choose this, I will show the exact apt/install/start commands I will run and will only proceed after you confirm.\n\nI will wait for one clear reply from you indicating either Option A (with details) or Option B (the exact phrase).",
