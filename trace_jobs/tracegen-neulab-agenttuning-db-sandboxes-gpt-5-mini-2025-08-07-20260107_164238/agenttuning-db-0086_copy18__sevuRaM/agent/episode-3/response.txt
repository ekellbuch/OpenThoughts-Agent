  "plan": "1) Ask you to provide the target database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the question you want answered. 2) Once you provide that and the question, I will: either (a) produce a single SQL statement (in the required one-line markdown code block) as Action: Operation for you to execute, or (b) if no DB is available and you want to modify schema/data, produce the appropriate SQL statement to run. 3) You will run the SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and either issue the next single SQL statement or, when finished, return Action: Answer with the exact final answer array. I will only produce one SQL statement per operation round, formatted exactly as you required.",
