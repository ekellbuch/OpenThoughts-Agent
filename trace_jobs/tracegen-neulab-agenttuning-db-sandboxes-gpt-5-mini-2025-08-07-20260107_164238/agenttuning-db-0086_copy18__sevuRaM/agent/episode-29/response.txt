You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container (this will modify the environment):\n- Reply exactly: install local server\n- If you choose this I will (and will show these exact commands before executing):\n  1) apt-get update -y\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) initialize/start mysqld (use mysqld_safe or direct mysqld if systemd isn't available)\n  4) create user/database or set root password as you instruct\n  After installing and confirming the server is running I will proceed to run SQL per your instructions, one statement at a time.\n\nI will not install or start any server and I will not run SQL until you explicitly reply with either Option A (with details) or Option B (the exact phrase).",
