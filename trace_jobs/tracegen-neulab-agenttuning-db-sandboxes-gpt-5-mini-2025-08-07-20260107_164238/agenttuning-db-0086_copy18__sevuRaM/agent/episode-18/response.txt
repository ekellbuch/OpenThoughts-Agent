After you provide that, I'll produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute.\n- Option B: Reply exactly 'install local server' to permit me to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container. If you choose that, I'll display the exact apt/install/start commands I plan to run and proceed only after you confirm.\nI will not install or run anything until you explicitly choose one of these options.",
