No local MySQL server was detected earlier (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installing a local server. I'm waiting for an explicit choice from you to proceed.",
  "plan": "Do not perform any installation or database operations without your explicit consent. Prompt you one more time, clearly and succinctly, to choose exactly one of the two options: (A) provide connection details and the question in the exact single-line format so I can produce the next SQL statement; or (B) reply exactly 'install local server' to permit me to install and configure a local MySQL server here. After you reply with one of these, I will follow the workflow described previously (either produce one SQL statement for you to run, or show the exact install/start commands and proceed only after your confirmation).",
