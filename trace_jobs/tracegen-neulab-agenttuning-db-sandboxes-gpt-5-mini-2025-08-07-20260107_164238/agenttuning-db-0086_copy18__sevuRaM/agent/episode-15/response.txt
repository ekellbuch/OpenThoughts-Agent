  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql, Ver 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server detected (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld found earlier) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database and you have not authorized installing a local server. I'm waiting for a clear instruction from you to proceed.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two options so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB (recommended if you have a remote or local server already running):\n- Reply on a single line with connection details and the question in this exact format:\n  host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide that, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format: start with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and either provide the next SQL or the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container (I will modify the environment):\n- Reply exactly: install local server\n- If you choose this, I will show the exact commands I will run beforehand (apt-get install mysql-server, initialize/start server, create user/database or set root password). I will not execute them until you explicitly confirm. Note that starting system services may need special handling in this environment; I will adapt using direct mysqld startup if systemd is not available.\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials here, choose Option A and run the SQL I provide locally with your mysql client, then paste the results back.",
