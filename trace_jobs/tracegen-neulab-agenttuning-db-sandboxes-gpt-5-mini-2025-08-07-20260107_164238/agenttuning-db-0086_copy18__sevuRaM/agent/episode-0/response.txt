  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app with no command history or other context shown. No MySQL-related information is currently visible. To operate a MySQL database I need to (1) determine whether the MySQL client is available, (2) check whether a MySQL server is running and where it is listening, and (3) find credentials or socket to connect. Nothing has been accomplished yet; the next steps are discovery commands to locate the client, server, and connection details so I can run SQL as you require.",
  "plan": "1) Check for mysql client binary and its version to know if I can connect from this container. 2) Check running processes for mysqld to see if a server is running locally. 3) Check open TCP ports (3306) to see if MySQL is listening on a network port. 4) List files in /app in case there are credentials or DB files. 5) If the client exists and server is found, we'll attempt to connect (you will ask a specific question and I will provide the single-line SQL in a code block as required). Each command is small and quick.",
