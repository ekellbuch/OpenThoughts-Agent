Once you provide the connection details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted as required: begin with 'Action: Operation' and include a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will then parse the output and either provide the next single SQL statement or, when finished, return the final answer using the exact pattern 'Action: Answer' and Final Answer: [\"...\"] as required. If you prefer not to share credentials, you can run the SQL I provide locally and paste the output back.",
