  "analysis": "The container currently has no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found). No mysqld process is running according to ps, and tools ss/netstat are not available. The /app directory is empty. At this point we cannot run SQL because we lack a client and there's no evidence a MySQL server is running locally. We need to (1) discover the OS/package manager to know how to install a client, (2) look for any existing MySQL data directories or sockets and any environment variables with connection info, and (3) attempt to install a client if a package manager is available so we can connect to a server (local or remote).",
  "plan": "1) Inspect OS release to determine package manager (cat /etc/os-release). 2) Check for common package managers (apt-get, apt, apk, yum, dnf). 3) Look for local MySQL data or socket directories (/var/lib/mysql, /var/run/mysqld). 4) Inspect environment for MYSQL_* variables that might contain connection info. Depending on results, attempt to install a client (e.g., apt-get install default-mysql-client) or use an available client. Each command is exploratory and quick; after these steps I'll propose the exact SQL to run once a client and server are available.",
