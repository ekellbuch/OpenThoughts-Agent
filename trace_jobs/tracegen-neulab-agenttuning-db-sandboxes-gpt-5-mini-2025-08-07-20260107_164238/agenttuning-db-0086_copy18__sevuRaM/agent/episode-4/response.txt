No SQL has been executed yet. To proceed I need the target database connection details and the specific question you want answered with SQL.",
  "plan": "1) You provide the database connection details (host, port, username, password, database name) and the question you want answered (or the schema/table to query). 2) I will convert your question into a single SQL statement and present it exactly as required: begin with 'Action: Operation' and include one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block. 3) You will execute only that SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output. 4) I will parse the output and either provide the next single SQL statement to run or, if finished, present the final answer as 'Action: Answer' with Final Answer: [\"...\"] exactly. Note: every operation round I will supply only one SQL statement; please run it and return its output.",
