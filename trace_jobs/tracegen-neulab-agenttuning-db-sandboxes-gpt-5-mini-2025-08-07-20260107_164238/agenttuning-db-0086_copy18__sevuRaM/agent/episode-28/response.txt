There is no evidence of a running local MySQL server (earlier checks found no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL statements have been executed because you have not supplied connection details for an existing MySQL instance and you have not given permission to install a local server. I'm blocked from running any SQL until you choose one of two options.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose exactly one of the two options below. After you reply I will proceed as described.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB (you provide):\n- Reply on a single line in this exact format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide that, I will craft a single SQL statement (one-line) and output it as: Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block (you will run only that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back). I will then parse the output and either produce the next single SQL or return the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install a local MySQL server in this container (you permit):\n- Reply exactly: install local server\n- If you choose this I will (and will show these exact commands before running them):\n  1) apt-get update -y\n  2) DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) initialize/start mysqld if needed (systemd may not be available), e.g. start mysqld_safe or run mysqld directly in background\n  4) run mysql --execute to create a database/user or set root password as you instruct\n  After installation I will confirm the server is running and then proceed to produce SQL statements per your questions (one at a time, as required).\n\nI will not install or start any server and I will not run any SQL until you explicitly reply with either Option A (with details) or Option B (the exact phrase).",
