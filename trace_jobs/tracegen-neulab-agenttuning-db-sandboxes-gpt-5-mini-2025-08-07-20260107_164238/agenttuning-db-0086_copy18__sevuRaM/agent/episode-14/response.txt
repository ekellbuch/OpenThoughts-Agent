There is no evidence of a running local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld found earlier) and no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection details. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided connection details for an existing database, and you have not authorized installing a local server. I'm waiting on your explicit choice: provide DB connection details and the question to run, or permit installing a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "Wait for your explicit instruction. You must choose one of the two options:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing DB: provide connection details in this exact single-line format: host=... port=... user=... password=... database=... question='...'\n- After you provide those details and the question, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (prefixed with 'Action: Operation' and with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute that one SQL statement and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse it and continue with the next single SQL or return the final answer when done.\n\nOption B — Install a local server: reply exactly 'install local server' to grant permission. If you choose this I will (before executing) show the exact apt and initialization commands I plan to run to install and start MySQL server here, then proceed only after you confirm.\n\nI will not install or run any SQL until you explicitly choose one of these options.",
