There is currently no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no local MySQL server data or socket (/var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist), and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection info. To run SQL we need a MySQL client; either a remote database connection details must be provided by you or we must install a client to connect to a remote server. No SQL has been executed yet.",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client so we can run SQL statements from this container. Steps: (1) update apt package lists, (2) install default-mysql-client package, (3) verify the mysql client is available by checking its version and path. After the client is installed, I will ask you for the target database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or the SQL question you want run. Commands below perform the install and verification.",
