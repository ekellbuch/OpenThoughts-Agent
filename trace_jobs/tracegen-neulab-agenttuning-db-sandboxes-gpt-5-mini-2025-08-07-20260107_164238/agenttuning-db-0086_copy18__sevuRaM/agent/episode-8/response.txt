There is no evidence of a local MySQL server (no /var/lib/mysql or /var/run/mysqld previously) and there are no MYSQL_* environment variables with connection info. No SQL statements have been run against any database. To proceed I need either (A) connection details for an existing MySQL instance (host, port, user, password, database) plus the exact question you want answered, or (B) explicit permission to install and configure a local MySQL server in this container so I can run SQL here.",

I will not install server without your confirmation. Once you choose and provide details, I will produce the next single SQL statement formatted exactly as required (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block).",
