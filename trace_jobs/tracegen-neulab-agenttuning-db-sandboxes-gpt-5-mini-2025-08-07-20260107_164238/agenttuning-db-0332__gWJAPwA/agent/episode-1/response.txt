  "analysis": "Current container has no MySQL client or server: 'mysql' command is not found, no mysqld processes, no /var/lib/mysql, and 'ss' is not installed. That means I cannot run SQL against a MySQL server until a client is available and a server is present and reachable. The immediate goal is to get a MySQL client installed (or an alternative client like mariadb-client) so I can attempt to connect to any running MySQL server (if one exists elsewhere) or prepare to operate against a local server if you start one. I will detect which package manager is available and install an appropriate client. After the client is installed I will attempt a test query (SELECT VERSION();) to verify connectivity.",
  "plan": "1) Detect which package manager is present (apt-get, apk, or yum). 2) Use the detected package manager to install a MySQL/MariaDB client: default-mysql-client for Debian/Ubuntu (apt), mariadb-client for Alpine (apk), or mariadb for RHEL/yum. 3) After installation, run a simple test SQL statement to check connectivity: SELECT VERSION(); If the mysql client connects, we'll be ready to run your requested SQL statement. Each command is chosen to reveal environment capabilities or to install the client; the install steps may take longer, so durations are increased accordingly.",
