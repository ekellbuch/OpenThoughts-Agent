  "analysis": "We are at a root shell inside the container (/app). No prior MySQL commands have been run. To answer SQL questions I need to locate a running MySQL server and/or the mysql client and then connect to it. Currently nothing about MySQL is known (no processes, ports, or credentials). The next steps should detect whether MySQL/MariaDB is installed and running, and attempt a simple connection as root (no password) to verify access. After that I can run the single SQL statement you request per your workflow.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary is available. 2) Check whether a mysqld server process is running. 3) Check listening TCP ports to see if MySQL is accepting connections (default 3306). 4) Inspect the MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) to see if databases exist. 5) Attempt a simple connection and query (SELECT VERSION();) as root without a password to test access. Based on results I'll proceed with the exact single-line SQL you request next. Each command is lightweight except the mysql client test which may take slightly longer if it tries to connect.",
