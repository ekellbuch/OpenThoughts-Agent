  "analysis": "We are on an Ubuntu 24.04 container with apt-get available. There is no mysql client installed and no mysqld server running. Because no local MySQL server is available, I cannot run SQL yet. To proceed I can either (A) install a MySQL/MariaDB client here and then connect to a remote database you provide credentials for, or (B) install a local MySQL/MariaDB server (if you want the database hosted locally). At minimum, installing a client will let me run queries against a remote server you provide. Installing a local server will let me create and query databases locally, but that requires more setup and possibly data initialization.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists. 2) Install the default MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so we have a mysql command-line client. 3) Verify the mysql client installation by checking mysql --version. After that I will ask you whether you want me to: (a) connect to a remote database (you must supply host, port, user, password, and database), or (b) install and initialize a local MySQL/MariaDB server so we can run SQL locally. If you choose remote, I'll then run the single SQL statement you provide (following your rules).",
