  "analysis": "The shell is open as root in /app. No MySQL interaction has been attempted yet. There is no visible output from any prior MySQL commands. Before asking or running any SQL, we need to determine whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is installed and running and whether a MySQL client is available so we can connect. The next steps are to inspect the filesystem for MySQL-related directories, check for running mysqld processes, and check for a mysql client binary and listening port (3306). After that, I'll be ready to accept your SQL question and run a single SQL statement as requested.",
  "plan": "1) Print current directory and list files to confirm environment. 2) Look for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 3) Check whether a mysql client binary is available. 4) Check for MySQL data directory and socket directory (/var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld). 5) Check listening ports for a service on 3306. Based on those results, I'll either attempt to connect (if client and server are available) or ask you for the database question and credentials. Each command is chosen to reveal whether MySQL is present and accessible.",
