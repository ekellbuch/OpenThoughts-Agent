  "analysis": "Current environment: a root shell in /app. There are no files in /app. No mysqld/mariadbd processes are running. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld are empty or do not exist, and nothing is listening on port 3306. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a local MySQL server right now. To proceed I need either (A) access credentials for a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) so I can connect from a client, or (B) permission to install a MySQL client here and optionally start a local server. Before attempting installation, it’s useful to detect the OS and available package manager so I can choose the correct install commands.",
  "plan": "1) Detect the Linux distribution by reading /etc/os-release to decide how to install a client if you want me to. 2) Check whether apt-get or yum is available so I can propose an install command. After these checks I'll ask you whether you want me to (a) install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and possibly server) here, or (b) provide connection details for a remote database so I can run SQL there. If you choose installation, I'll proceed to install the client and then connect and run the single SQL statement you provide (one statement per your rules).",
