There is no active SQL question from the user yet; the environment prompt shows no running commands. Before executing any SQL, I should discover whether a MySQL server/client are available, where database files/config are located, and whether a server is running and listening. Once I know how to connect (socket, TCP, credentials), I can issue the single SQL statement you request in the required format and iterate on results.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm the current user and basic environment. 2) Check for a MySQL client (mysql) binary. 3) Look for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 4) Inspect typical MySQL data and config locations (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql). 5) Check listening sockets/ports to see if MySQL is reachable over TCP. 6) Look for any environment variables or files in /app that might contain DB credentials or SQL files. After these checks, report back findings and wait for the specific SQL question from you. Commands chosen are discovery-only and non-destructive.",
