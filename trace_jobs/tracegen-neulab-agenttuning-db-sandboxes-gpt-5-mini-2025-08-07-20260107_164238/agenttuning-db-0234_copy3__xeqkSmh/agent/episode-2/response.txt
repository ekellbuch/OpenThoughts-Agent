  "analysis": "The container runs Ubuntu 24.04 and has apt/apt-get available. No MySQL/MariaDB client or server binaries are present (mysql, mariadb, mysqladmin missing). There is no local MySQL server running and no MySQL directories. To be able to run SQL statements from this shell we must first install a MySQL client (or MariaDB client). After installing a client we can connect to a server (local or remote) using credentials you provide and then run the single SQL statement you ask for in the required format.",
  "plan": "1) Update the package index so apt can fetch packages. 2) Install the MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so the `mysql` command becomes available. 3) Verify the client was installed by checking `mysql --version` and locating the binary. After this I will ask you for connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or for the SQL question you want executed. If you want me to connect to a specific database, provide credentials and I'll prepare the exact SQL statement. The commands below perform the installation and verify the client.",
