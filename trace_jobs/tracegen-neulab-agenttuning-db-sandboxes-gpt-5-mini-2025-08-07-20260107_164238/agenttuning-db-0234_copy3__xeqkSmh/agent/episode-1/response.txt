  "analysis": "From the last commands: you are root in /app. There is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found). No mysqld/mysql process is running. Typical MySQL directories /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql do not exist. No environment variables referencing MySQL were found. /app is empty. In short: there is currently no MySQL server or client available in this container, so we cannot run SQL against a local MySQL instance yet.",
  "plan": "Detect the OS and available package manager so we can decide how to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (or server) if needed. Specifically: 1) Show /etc/os-release to identify the distribution. 2) Check for common package managers: apt, apt-get, yum, dnf, apk. 3) Check for an alternative client binary (mariadb, mysqladmin). 4) If a package manager exists, report back and (on your confirmation) I can install a client (e.g., mariadb-client or default-mysql-client) or provide commands to connect to a remote DB if you supply credentials. For now I'll only probe the environment (non-destructive discovery).",
