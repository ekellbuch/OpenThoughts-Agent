  "analysis": "No changes since the last checks. This container has no MySQL client (mysql command not found), no mysqld process is running, no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent), and /app is empty. You also have not provided any database question or remote database connection details. Given this state I cannot execute SQL here or connect to a remote database without credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will: (1) explain the approach and reasoning; (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server; (3) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, specify whether to install client-only (mariadb-client) or server+client (mariadb-server mariadb-client). Upon explicit approval I will run: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-client (client-only) or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client (server+client); then start the server if installed and proceed to run SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nReply with which option you choose and, if Option 1, include the DB question and any connection info; if Option 2, confirm whether to install client-only or server+client.",
