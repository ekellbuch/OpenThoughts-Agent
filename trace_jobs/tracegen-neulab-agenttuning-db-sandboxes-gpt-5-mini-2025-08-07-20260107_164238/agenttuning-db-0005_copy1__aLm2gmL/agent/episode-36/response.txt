  "analysis": "The container is unchanged: working directory /app is empty. There is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection details. In this environment I cannot execute or test any SQL until you either (A) provide a database question (and optionally remote connection credentials) so I can craft a single SQL statement for you to run, or (B) explicitly permit installation of a client or server+client here so I can run SQL locally.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of these two options you want to proceed with, and include any needed details:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the exact database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want the SQL tailored to a particular server. I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted per your protocol) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you paste back the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2 - client-only\" to allow me to install mariadb-client, or \"Option 2 - server+client\" to allow installing mariadb-server and mariadb-client. If you permit installation I will run apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, then start the server if installed and run discovery queries. I will not run any install commands until you explicitly authorize them.\n\nAfter you choose, I will (a) explain the SQL I plan to use and my reasoning, and (b) either provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to run, or execute the requested installation/discovery commands here and continue.",
