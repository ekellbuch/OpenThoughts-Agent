  "analysis": "No new terminal activity. Previous checks show this container has no MySQL client or server installed, no MySQL processes, no MySQL config or data directories, and /app is empty. Therefore I cannot run or test any SQL here until I either (A) receive a database question plus connection details so I can produce SQL for you to run remotely, or (B) am authorized to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) into this container so I can run queries locally.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do next and I will proceed accordingly:\n\n1) Provide the database question (and optionally host, port, user, password). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single-line SQL markdown block) for you to execute against your database. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I'll parse it and continue.\n\n2) Permit me to install a client (or server + client) in this container. If you allow installation, I'll run apt-get update and then apt-get install -y mariadb-client (for client only) or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client (for local server+client). After installation I will start the server (if installed) and then we can run SQL here. I will not install anything until you explicitly approve.\n\nPlease reply with your choice and, if choosing option 1, include the DB question and any connection info (if you want me to craft SQL that uses specific schema/table names).",
