  "analysis": "No new activity in the terminal. From previous inspections: the container has no MySQL client or server installed (mysql command not found), no mysqld process, no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql missing), and /app is empty. I therefore cannot run SQL here. You also have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection details to craft a query for you to execute elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the two workflows you want and I will proceed accordingly:\n\n1) You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my reasoning and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block for you to run on that MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue.\n\n2) You permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) in this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, specify whether you want client-only or server+client. I will then run: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-client (client-only) or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client (server+client), then start the server if installed and proceed to run SQL. I will show each SQL statement in the exact one-line markdown block when ready to operate.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and, if choosing option 1, provide the DB question and any connection info. If choosing option 2, confirm whether to install client-only or server+client.",
