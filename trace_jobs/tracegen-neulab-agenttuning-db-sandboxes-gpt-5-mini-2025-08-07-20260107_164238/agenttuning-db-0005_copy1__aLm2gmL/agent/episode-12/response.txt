  "analysis": "The container is unchanged: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process, /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf do not exist, and there are no MySQL-related environment variables. Because of this, I cannot execute or test any SQL locally in this environment. You also have not provided a database question or remote database connection details for me to craft SQL to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the two workflows and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — Permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, tell me whether to install client-only (mariadb-client) or server+client (mariadb-server mariadb-client). With your approval I will run: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-client (client-only) or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client (server+client); then start the server if installed and proceed to run SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nReply with which option you choose and, if Option A, include the DB question and any connection info; if Option B, confirm whether to install client-only or server+client.",
