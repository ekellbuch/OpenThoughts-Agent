  "analysis": "No change in the container: working directory /app is empty. There is no MySQL client (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process, and no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf do not exist). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB credentials. Therefore I cannot execute or test SQL in this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and (optionally) remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will: (a) explain the approach and my reasoning for the SQL I will produce; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your protocol (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL markdown block for you to run on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output here, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Permit me to install software and tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you approve I will run these exact commands (only after your explicit approval):\n- apt-get update\n- For client-only: apt-get install -y mariadb-client\n- For server+client: apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\nThen, if a server is installed, I will start it (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb) and run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; USE <db>; SHOW TABLES;) before executing any SQL. I will present each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown code block.\n\nTell me which option you choose. If Option 1, include the exact database question and any connection details you want me to use. If Option 2, confirm whether to install \"client-only\" or \"server+client\". I will not run any installs or SQL until you explicitly instruct me to proceed.",
