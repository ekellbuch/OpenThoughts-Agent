  "analysis": "The container remains unchanged: /app is empty, there is no MySQL client (mysql command not found), no mysqld process, no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf do not exist). You also have not provided a database question or remote database connection details. Given this state I cannot execute or test SQL locally in this environment.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the following and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection info: host, port, user, password, database). I will: (1) explain the approach and SQL needed; (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to run on your MySQL server; (3) after you paste the raw MySQL output back here, parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — You permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) in this container so I can run queries locally. If you authorize installation, tell me whether to install client-only or server+client. If you allow installation I will run these commands (only after you approve):\n- apt-get update\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-client           (client-only)\nor\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client   (server + client)\nThen, if a server is installed, I will start it (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb) and proceed to run SQL. I will always present each SQL statement in the exact one-line markdown block as required.\n\nTell me which option you choose and, if Option A, provide the DB question and any connection info; if Option B, confirm whether to install client-only or server+client. I will not run any installations or SQL until you explicitly instruct me to do so.",
