  "analysis": "No new activity in the terminal. From earlier checks: this container has no MySQL client or server installed, /app is empty, there are no MySQL environment variables, no mysqld process, and no MySQL data/config present. Therefore I cannot run any SQL here until you either (A) provide a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password) so I can craft SQL for you to run, or (B) allow me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) in this container so I can execute queries locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to do one of the following and then proceed:\n\n1) Provide the database question you want answered and (optionally) remote DB connection details. If you only provide the question, I will explain my approach and then supply exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block) for you to execute against your database. After you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I'll parse it and continue.\n\n2) If you want me to run queries from inside this container, grant permission to install software. If you allow installation, I will run these commands to add a client (and server if desired):\n- apt-get update\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-client          (to get a client only)\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client   (to get server+client)\n\nAfter installation I will start the server (if installed) and create/connect to databases and then proceed to run SQL as you request. I will show each SQL statement in the exact one-line markdown block when ready to operate.\n\nTell me which option you choose (provide the question and/or credentials, or permit installation).",
