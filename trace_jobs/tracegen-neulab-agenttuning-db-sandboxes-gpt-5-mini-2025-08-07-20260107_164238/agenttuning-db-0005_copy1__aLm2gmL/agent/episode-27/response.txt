  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You also have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote DB without additional information or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You will run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" plus the database question you want answered. If you want me to craft SQL that targets a specific server, also include connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will then: (a) explain my approach and reasoning; (b) provide exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — I run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and specify whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will run (only after your explicit approval) apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, then start the server if installed and run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES;) before executing any SQL. I will present each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown block. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection details), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I plan to use and my reasoning, and (2) either provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to run or run the requested installation commands here if you authorized Option 2.",
