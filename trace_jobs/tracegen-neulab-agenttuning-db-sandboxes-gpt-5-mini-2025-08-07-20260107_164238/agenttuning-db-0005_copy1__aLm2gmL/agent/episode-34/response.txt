  "analysis": "This container has no MySQL client or server installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent), and /app is empty. You also haven't provided a database question or any remote DB connection details. Given this state I cannot run or test any SQL in this environment until you either provide connection details for a remote server or allow me to install client/server software here.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed. I list exactly what I will do for each option.\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely (no installs here):\n- You provide the database question (and, if you want SQL targeted to a specific server, provide connection details: host, port, user, password, database).\n- I will: explain the approach and reasoning, then produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your protocol (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL code block (you will execute it on your server and paste the raw MySQL output back). After you return the output I will parse it and iterate as needed.\n\nOption 2 — I install and run MySQL/MariaDB in this container (I will only run these after you explicitly approve):\n- If you want client only: I will run these commands in order:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-client\n  After installation I will run discovery (mysql --version and attempt to connect to socket/localhost if credentials provided).\n- If you want server+client: I will run these commands in order:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\n  3) service mysql start\n  Then I will run initial discovery: mysql --version; mysql -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" (if no root password is required) or guide you to provide credentials. I will then run any SQL you ask, but per your rules I will present each SQL statement as a single-line SQL code block labeled Action: Operation and only one statement per round.\n\nNotes and expectations:\n- If you choose Option 1, reply with \"Option 1\" and your database question (and any connection details if desired). I will produce the one-line SQL statement for you to execute.\n- If you choose Option 2, reply with \"Option 2 - client-only\" or \"Option 2 - server+client\" to authorize installation. I will then run the exact apt-get/service commands above and continue.\n- I will not install or run SQL until you explicitly confirm which option to proceed with.\n",
