  "analysis": "Container state unchanged: working directory /app is empty. There is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question nor any remote DB connection credentials. Therefore I cannot execute or test any SQL in this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose one of two clear options. Please reply with exactly one of the following options (and provide any necessary details):\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and give the database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want SQL tailored to a particular server. I will then: (a) explain my approach and reasoning; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL markdown code block for you to execute on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and indicate whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will run these exact commands (only after your explicit approval):\n1) apt-get update\n2a) For client-only: apt-get install -y mariadb-client\n2b) For server+client: apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\n3) If server is installed, start it (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb) and then run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES;) before executing any SQL. I will present each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown code block. I will not run any installs or SQL until you explicitly authorize them.\n\nWhich option do you choose? If Option 1, provide the DB question (and optional connection details). If Option 2, confirm whether to install \"client-only\" or \"server+client\". After your choice I will proceed and show the exact commands or the single-line SQL block as required.",
