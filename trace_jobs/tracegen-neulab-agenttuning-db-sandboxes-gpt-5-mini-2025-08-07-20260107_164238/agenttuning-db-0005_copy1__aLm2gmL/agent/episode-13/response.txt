  "analysis": "The container is unchanged from earlier checks: /app is empty, there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). No database question or remote connection credentials have been provided. Given this state, I cannot run any SQL locally or connect to a remote database because no connection details were supplied.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — You permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, specify whether to install client-only (mariadb-client) or server+client (mariadb-server mariadb-client). Upon explicit approval I will run apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, start the server if installed, and then proceed to run SQL locally. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose and provide any needed details (the DB question and optionally connection info for Option 1, or permission and package choice for Option 2).",
