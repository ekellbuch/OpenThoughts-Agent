  "analysis": "The container has no MySQL client or server installed or running. /app is empty. Commands previously run show: 'mysql' is not found, no mysqld process, no /var/lib/mysql, and no MySQL config. Therefore I cannot run SQL here unless you either (A) provide a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password) for me to craft queries for you to run, or (B) allow me to install a client/server in this container so I can execute statements locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to give the database question you want answered. After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain the problem and my reasoning about what SQL is needed. 2) Choose to either 'Operate' (provide exactly one SQL statement in a single markdown code block, one-line) or 'Answer' (if no DB operations are needed). If you want me to run queries from inside this container instead of you running them, tell me and I will install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and server if you want local DB) and then connect/run queries. If you provide remote DB credentials or grant install permission, I will proceed accordingly. No SQL will be executed until you confirm or provide the DB question/credentials.",
