  "analysis": "The container has no MySQL client or server installed (mysql: command not found). There is no mysqld process, no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf absent), and /app is empty. Because of this I cannot execute any SQL locally. You also have not provided a database question or remote DB connection details for me to craft a query for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "Tell me which of the following you want to do and I'll proceed accordingly:\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will: (a) explain my approach and reasoning; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server; then (c) parse the raw mysql output you paste back and continue until the question is answered. This requires no changes to this container.\n\nOption 2 — You permit me to install and/or run MySQL/MariaDB in this container. If you approve, tell me whether you want client-only or server+client. I will then run (after your explicit approval) the exact commands: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-client (client-only) or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client (server+client); start the server if installed; then run discovery queries and the SQL you ask for. I will present each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown block when ready to operate.\n\nPlease reply with your choice (Option 1 or Option 2). If Option 1, include the database question and any connection info you want me to use. If Option 2, confirm whether to install client-only or server+client.",
