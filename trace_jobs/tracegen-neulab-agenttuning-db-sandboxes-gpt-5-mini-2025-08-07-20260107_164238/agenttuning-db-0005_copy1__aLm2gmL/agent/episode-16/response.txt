  "analysis": "The container is unchanged from prior checks: /app is empty, there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL configuration or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote database connection details. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL locally in this environment or connect to a remote DB without credentials.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following options. After you pick, I'll proceed exactly as described.\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). What I will do: (a) explain the approach and reasoning for the SQL I propose; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL markdown code block for you to run on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — You permit me to install software in this container so I can run SQL locally. Decide whether you want \"client-only\" or \"server+client\". If you authorize installation I will run these exact commands (I will not run them until you explicitly approve):\n- apt-get update\n- For client only: apt-get install -y mariadb-client\n- For server+client: apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\nThen, if a server is installed, I will start it (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb) and perform discovery (show databases; show tables) before executing any SQL you request. For Option 2 I will show each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown block when ready to operate.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection info), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus whether to install \"client-only\" or \"server+client\".\n\nOnce you choose, I'll proceed and provide the exact SQL or installation commands as requested.",
