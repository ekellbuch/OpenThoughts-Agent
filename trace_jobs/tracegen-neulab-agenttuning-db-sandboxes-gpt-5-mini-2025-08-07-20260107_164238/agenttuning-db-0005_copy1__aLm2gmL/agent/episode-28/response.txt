  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and currently cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL configuration or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question nor remote DB connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote database without either credentials or permission to install software here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want SQL tailored to a particular server. I will then explain my approach and provide exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line SQL markdown block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output here, I'll parse it and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and indicate whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will run apt-get update and the chosen install commands, start the server if installed, and then run discovery queries and any SQL you request. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nTell me which option you choose (and provide the DB question or installation permission/details). Once you reply I will explain the SQL plan and either present the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) or execute the installation commands as authorized.",
