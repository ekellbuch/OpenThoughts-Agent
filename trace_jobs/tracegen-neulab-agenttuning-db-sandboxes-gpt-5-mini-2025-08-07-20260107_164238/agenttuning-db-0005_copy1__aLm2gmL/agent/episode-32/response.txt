  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You also have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote database without further input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and give the database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and indicate whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run apt-get update and then install the chosen packages, start the server if installed, and run discovery queries before executing any SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection details), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you reply I will explain the SQL I plan to use and then provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) or run the requested installation commands as authorized.",
