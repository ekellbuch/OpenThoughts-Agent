  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote DB from this environment.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two explicit options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You will run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want SQL tailored to a particular server. I will then (a) explain the approach and reasoning, and (b) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and indicate whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run apt-get update and the chosen install commands, start the server if installed, and then run discovery queries before executing any SQL. I will present every SQL statement in the required single-line SQL code block. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice: either\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection details), or\n- \"Option 2 - client-only\" or \"Option 2 - server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you reply I will explain the SQL approach and provide the next action (either the single-line SQL statement for you to run, or the installation commands to execute here).",
