  "analysis": "The container state has not changed: /app is empty, there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL configuration or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote database connection details. Because of this, I cannot execute or test SQL locally in this environment or connect to a remote DB without credentials or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I cannot proceed until you choose one of two workflows. Please reply with which you want and include any required details:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and (optionally) remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Grant permission to install packages and specify whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you approve, I will run apt-get update and then install the chosen packages and (if server installed) start it and run discovery commands before executing any SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nOnce you pick an option, I will explain the SQL I plan to use and then produce a single SQL statement in the exact required format when ready to operate.",
