  "analysis": "Container state unchanged: /app is empty, mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf absent). You have not given a database question nor remote DB credentials. Therefore I cannot run any SQL here or connect to a remote DB without further input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and (optionally) connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will (a) explain the approach and reasoning for the SQL, and then (b) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted as required (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL markdown code block for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Permit me to install software and tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you approve, I will run apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, start the server if installed, and then run discovery queries before executing any SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly permit it.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection info), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you reply I will (1) explain the SQL I plan to use and my reasoning, and (2) either provide the single-line SQL (Action: Operation) for you to run or run the installation commands here if you authorized Option 2.",
