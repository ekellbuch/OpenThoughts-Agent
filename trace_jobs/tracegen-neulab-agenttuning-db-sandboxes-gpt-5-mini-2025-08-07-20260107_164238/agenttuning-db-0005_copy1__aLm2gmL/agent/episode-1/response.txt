  "analysis": "I inspected the environment. /app is empty. There are no MySQL-related environment variables. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). There is no mysqld process running and nothing listening on port 3306 (ss not found). /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf do not exist. In short: there is no MySQL client or server present in this container, so I cannot connect to or run SQL against a local database from here.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. According to your rules, when you ask a question I will: (a) explain the problem and my reasoning; (b) choose to either 'operate' (i.e., provide one SQL statement in the required single SQL code block format) or 'answer' if finished; and (c) if you want me to execute SQL from within this container instead of you executing it externally, I can install a MySQL/MariaDB client or server — but I will not do that without your permission. Next steps you can choose from:\n- If you want me to produce SQL for you to run against your MySQL server, ask the question and I will produce one SQL statement (in the required markdown format) for you to execute and then provide follow-up actions based on the returned output.\n- If you want me to set up a local MySQL/MariaDB server or client in this container so I can run queries here, tell me and I will run apt-get (or another package manager) install commands to add mariadb-server/mariadb-client and then start the server. (I will provide the exact commands before executing them if you request.)",
