  "analysis": "The container remains unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection credentials. Therefore I cannot execute or test any SQL locally in this environment right now.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the database question you want answered. Optionally include connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want SQL tailored to a particular server. I will then: (a) explain the approach and reasoning for the SQL; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and state whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run apt-get update and then install the chosen packages, start the server if installed, and run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES;) before executing any SQL. I will present each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown code block. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection details), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nAfter you reply I will explain the SQL I plan to use and then either provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) or run the requested installation commands as authorized.",
