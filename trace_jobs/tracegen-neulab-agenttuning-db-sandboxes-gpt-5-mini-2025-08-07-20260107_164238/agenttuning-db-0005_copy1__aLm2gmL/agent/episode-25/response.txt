  "analysis": "The container environment is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You also have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials. Given this state, I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote DB without further input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two clear paths so I can proceed: \n\nOption 1 — You will run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and (optionally) remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — I run SQL locally in this container: Grant permission to install packages and tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you approve, I will run apt-get update and then install the chosen packages and, if a server is installed, start it and run discovery queries before executing any SQL. I will not run any installation commands until you explicitly authorize them.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection info), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you choose, I will (1) explain the SQL I plan to use and my reasoning, and (2) provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) in the required markdown format or proceed with the installation commands as authorized.",
