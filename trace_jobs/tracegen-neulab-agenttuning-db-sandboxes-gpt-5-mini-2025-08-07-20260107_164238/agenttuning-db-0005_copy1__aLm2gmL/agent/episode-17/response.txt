  "analysis": "The container is unchanged: /app is empty, there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and no MySQL configuration or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf) are present. You have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials. Therefore I cannot run or test any SQL in this environment until you either (A) give a DB question and optionally remote credentials so I can produce an SQL statement for you to execute, or (B) authorize installing a client or server+client here so I can run SQL locally.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options below and reply with your choice. After you choose I will proceed exactly as described.\n\nOption 1 (You run SQL remotely):\n- Provide the database question and, if you want, remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my reasoning and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to run on your MySQL server. You will run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 (Install and run locally in this container):\n- Tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server and mariadb-client). If you approve, I will run these exact commands in sequence to set up the environment and then proceed to run SQL (I will not run them until you explicitly permit):\n  1) apt-get update\n  2a) For client-only: apt-get install -y mariadb-client\n  2b) For server+client: apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\n  3) If a server is installed, start it (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb) and then run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; USE <db>; SHOW TABLES;) as needed.\n\nIf you select Option 1, include the exact question and any connection details you want me to use. If you select Option 2, indicate \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" and I will run the installation/start commands and then continue.",
