  "analysis": "The container has no MySQL client or server installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent), and /app is empty. You have not provided a database question or remote database connection details. Given this state I cannot execute SQL here or connect to a remote database without credentials or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and optionally connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL markdown code block for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: If you permit installation, tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). With explicit approval I will run apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, start the server if installed, and then run discovery and the SQL you request. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nWhen you reply, either (A) give the DB question (and optional credentials) for Option 1, or (B) approve installation and specify \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" for Option 2. Once you do, I will explain my SQL approach and then supply the single SQL statement (one-line in a markdown code block) per your protocol.",
