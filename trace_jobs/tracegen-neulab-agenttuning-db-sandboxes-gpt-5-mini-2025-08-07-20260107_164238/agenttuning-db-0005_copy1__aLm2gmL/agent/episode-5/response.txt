  "analysis": "No changes since my last check. The container has no MySQL client or server installed (mysql command not found), no mysqld process, no MySQL config or data directories, and the /app directory is empty. Because of that I cannot run any SQL here. I also do not have any database question, schema, or connection credentials from you to craft a query for a remote server.",
  "plan": "You have two options; tell me which you choose and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — You provide the database question (and optionally connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my reasoning and then produce exactly one SQL statement (in a single-line SQL code block as required) for you to run on your MySQL server. Once you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue.\n\nOption B — You permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally a server) inside this container so I can run SQL locally. If you permit installation, I will run these commands (I will not run them until you approve):\n1) apt-get update\n2a) apt-get install -y mariadb-client     (client only)\nOR\n2b) apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client   (server + client)\n3) If server installed, start the service (service mysql start or systemctl start mariadb) and secure/setup root password as needed.\n\nIf you choose Option A, provide the question and (optionally) credentials. If you choose Option B, confirm which packages to install (client only or server+client) and I will proceed and then run discovery commands and connect to the DB.\n",
