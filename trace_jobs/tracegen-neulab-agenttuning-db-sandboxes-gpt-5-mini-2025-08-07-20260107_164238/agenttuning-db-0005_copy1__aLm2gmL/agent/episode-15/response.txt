  "analysis": "The container state is unchanged: /app is empty, there is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config/data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection details. Given this, I cannot run or test SQL locally in this environment.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two workflows so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I'll parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, specify whether to install client-only (mariadb-client) or server+client (mariadb-server mariadb-client). Upon explicit approval I will run apt-get update and then the chosen apt-get install commands, start the server if installed, and proceed to run SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nReply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optionally connection details), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus whether to install \"client-only\" or \"server+client\".\n\nOnce you choose, I will (a) explain the SQL needed and reasoning, and (b) provide a single one-line SQL statement in the required markdown format when ready to operate.",
