  "analysis": "Nothing has changed in the container: there is no MySQL client (mysql command not found), no mysqld process, no MySQL data/config (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf absent), and /app is empty. Because of this, I cannot execute any SQL locally in this environment. You also have not yet provided a database question or remote DB connection details for me to craft a query for you to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Please choose one of the following and I will proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, state whether you want client-only (mariadb-client) or server+client (mariadb-server mariadb-client). After your approval I will run apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, then start the server if installed, and proceed to run SQL locally. I will show each SQL statement in the required single-line markdown block when ready.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (the DB question and/or connection credentials, or permission to install and which packages).",
