  "analysis": "The terminal is an interactive shell inside /app as root. No MySQL client or database activity has been performed yet. There is currently no information about a running MySQL server, available databases, or SQL files in the working directory. Before issuing SQL statements (per your protocol), I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, whether a mysql client is available, and where database files or credentials might be located so I can connect and run queries.",
  "plan": "I'll run commands to: 1) inspect the current directory and common MySQL-related environment variables or files; 2) check whether a mysql client is installed and its version; 3) check for a running mysqld process or a service listening on port 3306; 4) look for MySQL data directory or config files and any SQL files in /app. These steps let me decide how to connect (local socket, TCP, or not available). After you provide the database question, I will produce the SQL statement in the required markdown format for execution. Commands I will run:\n- pwd and ls -la /app to see available files.\n- env | grep -i mysql to find credentials/environment variables.\n- which mysql and mysql --version to see if client exists.\n- ps aux | grep -E 'mysqld|mysql' to detect running server.\n- ss -ltnp | grep 3306 to see if something listens on TCP 3306.\n- ls -la /var/lib/mysql and cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf (if present) to find data/config.\n",
