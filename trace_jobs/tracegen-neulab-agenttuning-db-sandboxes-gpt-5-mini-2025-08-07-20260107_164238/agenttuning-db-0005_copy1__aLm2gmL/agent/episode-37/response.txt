  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You also have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection details. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote DB from this environment without additional input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of two explicit options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one of the choices below and include any required details:\n\nOption 1 — You will run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the database question you want answered. If you want SQL tailored to a specific server, also include connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will: (a) explain my approach and reasoning, then (b) provide exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2 - client-only\" to allow installation of mariadb-client, or \"Option 2 - server+client\" to allow installation of mariadb-server and mariadb-client. If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run: apt-get update; then install the chosen packages; if server is installed I will start it and run discovery (SHOW DATABASES, etc.). I will present each SQL statement as a single-line SQL code block when ready to operate. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nAfter you reply with one option (and provide any requested details), I will proceed and show the exact next action.",
