  "analysis": "The container remains unchanged: no MySQL client or server is installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent, and /app is empty. Because of that I cannot execute SQL locally in this environment. You also have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials for me to craft a query to run elsewhere.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the two workflows and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption A — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection info: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line SQL markdown block (Action: Operation) for you to run on your server. After you paste back the raw MySQL output, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption B — You permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries here. If you authorize installation, tell me whether to install client-only (mariadb-client) or server+client (mariadb-server mariadb-client). Upon approval I will run apt-get update and the chosen apt-get install commands, start the server if installed, and then proceed to run SQL. I will present every SQL statement in the exact single-line markdown code block when ready to operate.\n\nReply with either Option A (and the question and optional credentials) or Option B (and whether client-only or server+client).",
