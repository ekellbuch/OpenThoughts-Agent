Without a MySQL client or connection details I cannot execute SQL here. You also have not provided the database question or remote DB credentials for me to craft a statement for you to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction. Choose one of the following and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption 1 — You provide the database question (and optionally remote DB connection details: host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach, then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — You permit me to install a MySQL/MariaDB client (and optionally server) inside this container so I can run queries locally. If you approve, specify whether to install client-only or server+client. With your approval I will run:\n- apt-get update\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-client          (client-only)\nor\n- apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client   (server+client)\nThen I will start the server if installed and proceed to run SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nTell me which option you choose and, if Option 1, provide the DB question and any connection details; if Option 2, confirm whether to install client-only or server+client.",
