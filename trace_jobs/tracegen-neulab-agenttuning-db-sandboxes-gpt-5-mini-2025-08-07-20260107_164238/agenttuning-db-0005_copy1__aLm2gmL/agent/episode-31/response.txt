  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process is running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally in this environment.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear options so I can proceed. Describe which you want and provide any needed details.\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and give the database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will then: (a) explain my approach and reasoning; (b) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and indicate whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run: apt-get update; then apt-get install -y mariadb-client (client-only) or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client (server+client); and if a server is installed I will start it and run discovery queries before executing any SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nOnce you reply with Option 1 (and the question/credentials) or Option 2 (and package choice), I will provide the exact next commands or the single-line SQL statement per your protocol.",
