  "analysis": "The container is unchanged and currently cannot run MySQL commands: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, and there are no MySQL data/config directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You also have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test SQL in this environment or connect to a remote DB without further input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two clear paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and (optionally) remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain the approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Permit me to install packages and tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you approve, I will run apt-get update and install the chosen packages, start the server if installed, and then run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; etc.) before executing any SQL you request. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question (and optional connection info), or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you choose, I will (a) explain the SQL I plan to use and my reasoning, and (b) provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) in the required markdown format or proceed with installation commands as you authorize.",
