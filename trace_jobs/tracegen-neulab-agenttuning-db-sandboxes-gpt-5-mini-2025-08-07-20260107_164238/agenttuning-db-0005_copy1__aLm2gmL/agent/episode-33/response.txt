  "analysis": "The container state is unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection credentials. Given this, I cannot execute or test SQL locally or connect to a remote DB from this environment without further input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the exact database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want SQL tailored to a particular server. I will then: (a) explain the approach and reasoning for the SQL; (b) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your protocol (Action: Operation) in a single-line SQL markdown code block for you to execute on your MySQL server; (c) after you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I'll parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2\" and state whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run: apt-get update; then install the chosen packages (apt-get install -y mariadb-client for client-only, or apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client for server+client). If a server is installed I will start it and run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES;) before executing any SQL. I will not install or run anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required details (the DB question and optional connection info for Option 1; or \"client-only\" vs \"server+client\" for Option 2). Once you reply I will proceed and either (A) explain the SQL and present the single-line SQL block (Action: Operation) for you to run, or (B) perform the requested installation and continue running SQL locally.",
