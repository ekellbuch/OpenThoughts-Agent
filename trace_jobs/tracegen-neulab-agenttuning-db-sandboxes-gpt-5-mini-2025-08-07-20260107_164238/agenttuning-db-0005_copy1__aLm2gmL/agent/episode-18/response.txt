  "analysis": "No change since the last checks. The container working directory /app is empty. There is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, and no MySQL data or config directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You have not provided a database question or any remote database connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally in this environment.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of two paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Provide the database question and (optionally) connection details (host, port, user, password, database). I will explain my reasoning and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — I run SQL locally in this container: Grant permission to install packages and tell me whether to install \"client-only\" (mariadb-client) or \"server+client\" (mariadb-server mariadb-client). If you approve, I will run apt-get update and then install the chosen packages, start the server if installed, and run discovery queries before executing any SQL you request. I will not install anything until you explicitly permit it.\n\nReply with either:\n- \"Option 1\" plus your database question and any optional connection details, or\n- \"Option 2\" plus either \"client-only\" or \"server+client\" to authorize installation.\n\nOnce you reply, I will (a) explain the SQL needed and my reasoning, and (b) produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) in the required format or proceed with installations as you authorize.",
