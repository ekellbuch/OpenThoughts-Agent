  "analysis": "The container remains unchanged and cannot run MySQL: /app is empty, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld process running, and there are no MySQL config or data directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf are absent). You also have not provided a database question or any remote DB connection credentials. Given this state I cannot execute or test any SQL locally or connect to a remote database from this environment without further input or permission to install software.",
  "plan": "You must choose one of two clear options so I can proceed:\n\nOption 1 — You run SQL remotely: Reply with \"Option 1\" and provide the exact database question you want answered. Optionally include remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) if you want SQL tailored to a particular server. I will explain my approach and then produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute on your MySQL server. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output back, I will parse it and continue iteratively until the question is answered.\n\nOption 2 — Run SQL locally in this container: Reply with \"Option 2 - client-only\" to allow me to install mariadb-client, or \"Option 2 - server+client\" to allow installation of mariadb-server and mariadb-client. If you permit installation I will (only after your explicit approval) run: apt-get update; then install the chosen packages; if a server is installed I will start it and run discovery queries (SHOW DATABASES, SHOW TABLES) before executing any SQL. I will not install anything until you explicitly authorize it.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice and any necessary details (the DB question and optional connection info for Option 1; or \"client-only\" vs \"server+client\" for Option 2). Once you reply I will (1) explain the SQL approach and reasoning, and (2) either provide the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to run or run the requested installation/discovery commands in this container.",
