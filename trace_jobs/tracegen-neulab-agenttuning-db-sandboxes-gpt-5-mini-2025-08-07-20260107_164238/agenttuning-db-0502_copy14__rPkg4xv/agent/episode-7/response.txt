  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed at /usr/bin/mysql (MariaDB client). There is no local MySQL server running and no SQL has been executed. I cannot proceed to run any SQL because you have not provided connection details (host/port/user/password/database) nor specified a query or inspection you want performed. The terminal is idle at /app and ready to run commands once you provide the required information or choose to run statements locally and paste back the results.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you pick one of two options and provide the necessary details.\n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container: provide connection details and the first action.\n- Required: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate blank/other auth), and optionally a default database name. Then tell me the first action (for example: \"list databases\", \"show tables in database mydb\", \"show CREATE TABLE mytable\", or provide a specific SELECT query).\n- Once you provide credentials and the desired operation, I will: (1) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block as required by your rules, (2) run the mysql client noninteractively from this container using -e to execute that single statement, and (3) analyze the raw MySQL output you paste back and continue.\n\nOption B — You run queries locally and paste results: tell me what inspection/query you want (for example: \"list databases\" or \"show tables in mydb\") and I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will parse it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nNotes about formatting and execution:\n- If I operate (Option A), I will run mysql like: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\"\n- If you prefer not to share passwords here, choose Option B.\n- When I produce SQL to be executed it will be in a single-line SQL code block (markdown) and will contain only one SQL statement, per your rules.\n\nPlease reply with one of the following:\n- \"Option A\" plus connection info and the first action (host, port, user, password, database, and the operation you want), or\n- \"Option B\" plus the inspection/query you want me to provide as a single SQL statement for you to run and paste back the output.\n\nIf you'd like an example of the precise single-line SQL I'll produce for inspection, say e.g. \"Show databases (Option A)\" or \"Show tables in database mydb (Option B)\" and I'll provide it.\n",
