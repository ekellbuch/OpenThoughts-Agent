  "analysis": "The container has a MySQL/MariaDB client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and no local server is running. No SQL has been executed yet because I do not have connection details for any MySQL-compatible server. I'm ready to run queries but need credentials and the target database (or you can run queries locally and paste back results).",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you tell me which database to query and provide connection details or indicate you will run queries yourself. Please choose one of these options:\n\n1) Provide connection details so I can run SQL from this container. I need: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate blank/other auth), and database name (optional). After you provide them, tell me the first action you want (for example: list databases, list tables in a database, show schema for a table, or run a specific SELECT). I will then (a) produce exactly one SQL statement in a single markdown code block as required, and (b) run it noninteractively using the mysql client (mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\n2) If you prefer to run SQL locally, tell me what inspection or query you want done (for example: \"list databases\" or \"show tables in db X\"). I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back and I will analyze it and provide the next single SQL statement or final answer.\n\nExample SQL I would run to list databases (if you give credentials):\n- mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (host, port, user, password, database) or tell me what single inspection query you want to run locally. Once you reply, I will proceed and produce the single SQL statement in the required format.",
