  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and there is no local MySQL server running. No SQL has been executed because I have not been given any database connection details or a specific question to answer. The terminal is idle at /app and ready to run commands once you provide the required inputs.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you'd like to proceed and provide the necessary information. Two options:\n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container: provide connection details and the first action. I need: host (or socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate blank or other auth), and the database name (optional). Then tell me the first operation you want (e.g., list databases, list tables in a database, show schema for a table, run a particular SELECT). I will then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line markdown code block and run it using the mysql client (noninteractive via -e). Example I will run once you give credentials: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\"\n\nOption B — You run queries locally and paste back output: tell me what you want inspected (e.g., \"list databases\" or \"show tables in db X\"). I will then provide exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client; you will paste the raw output back and I will analyze it and give the next SQL or final answer.\n\nIf you want to start by inspecting the schema, say something like: \"List databases\" or \"Show tables in database mydb\" and indicate whether I should connect or you will run the SQL.\n\nSecurity note: if you prefer not to share passwords here, choose Option B and run the statements locally, then paste the raw output.\n\nPlease pick Option A or B and provide the required details (or tell me the first inspection/query to run).",
