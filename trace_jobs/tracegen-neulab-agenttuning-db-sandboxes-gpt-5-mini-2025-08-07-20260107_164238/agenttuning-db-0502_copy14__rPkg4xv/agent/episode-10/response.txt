  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) but there is no local MySQL server running and no SQL has been executed. I have repeatedly asked for connection details or for you to run statements locally and paste the raw output back, but you haven't provided either connection credentials or a specific query/inspection request. The terminal is idle at /app and ready to run commands once you tell me how you'd like to proceed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further commands until you choose one of two options and provide the required information: \n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container: provide connection details (host or socket path, port if not 3306, username, password or indicate blank/other auth, and optionally a default database) and tell me the first action you want (for example: \"list databases\", \"show tables in database mydb\", \"describe table X\", or a specific SELECT). Once you provide those, I will (1) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules) and (2) run it noninteractively from this container with the mysql client using -e, then analyze the raw MySQL output you paste back and continue.\n\nOption B — You run queries locally and paste results: tell me the inspection/query you want (e.g., \"list databases\" or \"show tables in mydb\"). I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will parse it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nIf you prefer, here are two ready-to-run single-line SQL statements you can use locally (pick one and run it with your mysql client, then paste the raw output back):\n- To list databases: ```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n```\n- To list tables in a specific database (replace mydb): ```sql\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'mydb';\n```\n\nTell me: do you choose Option A or Option B? If Option A, provide host, port (if not 3306), user, password (or indicate blank), and database (optional) plus the first action. If Option B, tell me which of the inspection queries above (or another single query) you want me to produce for you to run locally.",
