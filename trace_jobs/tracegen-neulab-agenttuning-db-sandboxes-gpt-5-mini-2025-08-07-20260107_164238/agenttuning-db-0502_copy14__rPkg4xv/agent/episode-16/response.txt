  "analysis": "The container has the MariaDB/MySQL client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local mysqld process detected earlier and no local MySQL data/config files were found. You have not provided remote DB connection details. To make progress I will attempt a local connection attempt (which will likely fail if no server is running) to get the exact error message, then check common socket and runtime locations and re-scan processes for any mysqld instances. This will help determine whether a local server exists or whether you must provide remote connection credentials or run statements yourself.",
  "plan": "1) Try to run a simple SHOW DATABASES; via the mysql client to capture any immediate error (no credentials supplied). 2) List common MySQL socket/runtime locations (/var/run/mysqld, /var/run/mysql, /tmp/mysql*). 3) Re-scan processes for mysqld to be certain none are running. 4) Re-check environment variables for any MySQL-related connection strings. Based on the outputs, I'll know whether a local server exists or whether you must provide remote connection details or run SQL locally and paste back results.",
