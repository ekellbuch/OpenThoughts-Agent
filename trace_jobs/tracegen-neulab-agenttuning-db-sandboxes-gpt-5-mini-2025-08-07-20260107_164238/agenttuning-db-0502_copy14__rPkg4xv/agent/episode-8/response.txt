  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) but there is no local MySQL server running and no SQL has been executed. I do not have any database connection details (host/port/user/password/database) and you have not specified the SQL question or inspection you want performed. The terminal is idle at /app and ready to run commands, but I cannot connect to any database without further information.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the two options below and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container: provide connection details and the first action. I need: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate blank/other auth), and optionally a database name. Also tell me the first action (e.g., \"list databases\", \"show tables in database mydb\", \"show CREATE TABLE mytable\", or a specific SELECT). Once you provide these, I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules) and run it noninteractively from this container using the mysql client (mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nOption B — You run queries locally and paste results: tell me the inspection/query you want (e.g., \"list databases\" or \"show tables in mydb\"). I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will analyze it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nSecurity note: If you prefer not to share credentials here, choose Option B and run the statements locally.\n\nWhen you reply, specify Option A or B and include the details or the first inspection request. I will then (a) produce the single-line SQL in the required format and (b) execute it if you provided credentials (Option A) or wait for your pasted output (Option B).",
