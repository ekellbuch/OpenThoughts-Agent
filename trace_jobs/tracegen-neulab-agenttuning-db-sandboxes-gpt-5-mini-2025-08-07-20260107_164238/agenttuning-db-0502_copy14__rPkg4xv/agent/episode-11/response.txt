I have requested connection details or for you to run SQL locally and paste back results, but you have not provided any further input. The terminal is idle at /app and ready to run commands once you specify how to proceed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the necessary information.\n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container: provide connection details (host or socket path, port if not 3306, username, password or indicate blank/other auth, and optionally a default database), and tell me the first action (e.g., list databases, show tables in database X, describe table Y, or a specific SELECT). Once provided I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (in a markdown code block as required) and run it using the mysql client noninteractively, then analyze the output you paste back.\n\nOption B — You run queries locally and paste results: tell me the inspection/query you want (e.g., \"list databases\" or \"show tables in mydb\"). I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back, and I will parse it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nIf you prefer, you can start by running one of these locally and pasting the raw output back here:\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'mydb';  (replace 'mydb' with your database name)\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details or the raw output to continue.",
