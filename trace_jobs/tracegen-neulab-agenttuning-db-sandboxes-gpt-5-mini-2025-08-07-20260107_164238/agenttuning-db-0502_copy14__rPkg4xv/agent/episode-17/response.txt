  "plan": "You have three ways to proceed; pick one and I'll follow it.\n\nOption A — You provide connection details and I will run SQL from this container: give me host (or socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or say blank / how to auth), and database (optional). Once you provide them I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required single-line markdown block and execute it noninteractively with the mysql client (using mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DB -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nOption B — You run SQL locally and paste raw output here: I will give you a single-line SQL statement (in the required format) for you to run with your mysql client, then paste the resulting raw MySQL output back and I will analyze it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nOption C — Start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container so I can connect locally. If you want this, I can attempt to install and start a server here (apt-get install mariadb-server or mysql-server and start mysqld). Note: starting a server inside the container may require extra steps (initialization, running the daemon in foreground), and will modify the container; tell me if you want me to proceed and I will run the necessary commands.\n\nIf you choose Option A or B, and you want to start by listing databases, use the following operation (this is the exact single-statement SQL I recommend you run if you will run it locally or if you want me to execute it once you give connection info):\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSHOW DATABASES;\n```\n\nWhen you reply, please either:\n- (A) give connection details and tell me to run the statement (then I'll run it from this container), or\n- (B) run the provided SQL yourself and paste the raw MySQL output back here, or\n- (C) say \"install server\" and I will attempt to install and start a local server and then proceed to run inspection SQL.\n",
