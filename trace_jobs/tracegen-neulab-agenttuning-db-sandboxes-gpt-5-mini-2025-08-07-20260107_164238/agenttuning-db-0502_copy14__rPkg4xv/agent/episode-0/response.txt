  "analysis": "I am in a container at /app as root. No recent commands have been run; there is no visible MySQL activity in the current terminal output. To answer future SQL questions I need to locate a MySQL client or server, find configuration (socket/port and any credentials), and then connect to run the requested SQL. Nothing has been accomplished yet.",
  "plan": "I'll probe the environment to discover whether a MySQL client or server is present, where MySQL data/config lives, and any environment variables or files that contain connection info. Steps: 1) show current directory and listing to understand the workspace; 2) list processes to see if a mysqld is running; 3) check for an installed mysql client binary and its version; 4) check common MySQL dirs (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) and config files; 5) search for .cnf files and environment variables mentioning mysql; 6) check open TCP ports to find MySQL listener (default 3306). Once I have connection info I will attempt to connect with the mysql client and then run the single SQL statement you ask me to execute. The commands below perform the discovery steps.",
