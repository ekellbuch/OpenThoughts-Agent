  "analysis": "The container has a MySQL/MariaDB client installed (/usr/bin/mysql). There is no local MySQL server running and no SQL has been executed. I cannot run any queries because you have not provided connection details (host/port/user/password/database) nor specified which SQL inspection or query you want performed. The terminal is idle and ready.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two options and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Let me connect from this container: provide connection details (host or socket path, port if not 3306, username, password or note if blank, and database name if you want a default). Also say the first action (e.g., \"list databases\", \"show tables in database X\", \"SELECT ...\"). After you provide those, I will produce exactly one SQL statement in a single-line SQL markdown block as required and run it using the mysql client non-interactively (mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\").\n\nOption B — You run SQL locally and paste results: tell me the inspection/query you want (e.g., \"list databases\" or \"show tables in mydb\"). I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back, and I will analyze it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nPlease choose Option A or B and provide the required details or the first inspection request. If you choose Option A, an example of the command I will run after you give credentials is: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\n(Commands are not executed now; awaiting your choice and any credentials or the inspection request.)",
