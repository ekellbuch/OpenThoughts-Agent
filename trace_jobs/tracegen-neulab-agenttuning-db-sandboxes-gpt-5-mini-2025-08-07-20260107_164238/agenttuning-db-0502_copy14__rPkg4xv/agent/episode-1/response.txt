  "analysis": "From the previous commands: the container is at /app and minimal. There is no mysql client or server present (which mysql returned nothing, mysql --version returned nothing). No mysqld process is running (ps output). No MySQL config files were found under /etc or /var. In short: there's currently no local MySQL client to run SQL against, and no local MySQL server is running. To run SQL I need a mysql client or connection info to a remote DB. Nothing has been accomplished toward executing SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I'll install a MySQL client so we can connect to a MySQL server (local or remote) and execute the SQL statements you request. Steps/commands: 1) apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) apt-get install the default-mysql-client package (non-interactive). 3) If the default client isn't available, attempt to install mariadb-client as a fallback. 4) Verify the mysql client binary and its version. After the client is present I'll ask you for the database host, port, user, password, and database name (or a socket) so I can compose the single-line SQL command you want me to run. The commands below perform the install and verification. I expect apt-get update to complete, then apt-get install to fetch and install the client, and finally which/mysql --version to confirm availability.",
