  "analysis": "The container has a MySQL/MariaDB client installed (/usr/bin/mysql) but there is no local mysqld process or local database files. No SQL has been executed because I don't have any connection details or a specified query. The environment is ready to run the mysql client, but I need either (A) connection credentials so I can connect from this container, or (B) for you to run SQL locally and paste back the raw MySQL output for me to analyze.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to choose how to proceed and provide the required information. Two clear options:\n\nOption A — I connect from this container: provide connection details (host or socket path, port if not 3306, username, password or indicate if blank/other auth, and optionally a default database). Also tell me the first action you want (e.g., \"list databases\", \"show tables in database mydb\", \"describe table X\", or a specific SELECT). Once provided I will: (1) produce exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block as required by your rules, (2) run the mysql client noninteractively from the container using -e to execute that single statement (e.g., mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL>\") and (3) analyze the raw output you paste back and continue.\n\nOption B — You run SQL locally and paste results: tell me what inspection/query you want (for example: \"list databases\" or \"show tables in mydb\"). I will return exactly one single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block for you to run with your mysql client. You will paste the raw MySQL output back here; I will parse it and provide the next single SQL statement or the final answer.\n\nPlease reply with one of the following:\n- \"Option A\" and the connection details (host, port, user, password or note if blank, database) plus the first action to run, or\n- \"Option B\" and the inspection/query you want me to produce a single SQL statement for you to run locally.\n\nIf you choose Option A, an example of the exact command I will run (after you supply credentials) is:\n- mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n\nSecurity note: If you prefer not to share passwords here, choose Option B and run the statements locally, then paste the raw output. I will not run any SQL until you pick an option and provide the necessary information.",
