There is no local mysqld running and no local database files found earlier, so I cannot run SQL against a local server. No SQL has been executed yet. To proceed I need connection details for a MySQL-compatible server (host/port or socket, credentials, and target database) or you can run commands locally and paste back the raw MySQL output for me to analyze.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide connection info or tell me which inspection query you want. Please provide one of the following:\n\n1) Connection details so I can run queries directly: - host (or socket path) - port (default 3306) - username - password (or tell me if empty or you'll provide auth interactively) - database name (optional)\n\n2) If you prefer to run queries yourself, tell me what you want inspected (e.g., list databases, list tables in a database, show CREATE TABLE for a table, run a SELECT). I will then produce exactly one SQL statement (a single-line SQL in a markdown code block as required). You will run that statement locally using the mysql client and paste the raw output back here; I will parse it and continue.\n\nWhen you give connection info I will run the mysql client noninteractively with the -e option, e.g.: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\". If you want me to inspect schema first, say which database and I will produce the single-line SQL to list tables or other schema info.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details. If you want me to start by listing databases, say \"list databases\" and provide connection info (host, user, password).",
