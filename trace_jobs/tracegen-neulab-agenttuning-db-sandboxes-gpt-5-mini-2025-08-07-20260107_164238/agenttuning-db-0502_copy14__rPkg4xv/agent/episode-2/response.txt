  "analysis": "I installed a MySQL/MariaDB client in the container. 'which mysql' shows /usr/bin/mysql and 'mysql --version' reports MariaDB client 10.11.13. There is no local mysqld process and no local database files were found earlier, so there's currently no local server to run queries against. To run SQL I need connection details for a MySQL-compatible server (host or socket, port, username, password, and optionally database name). Nothing has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I'll wait for you to provide the database connection details and the SQL question you want answered. When you provide them, I will: 1) Construct a single-line SQL statement in the required format (it must be the only SQL code block and one statement). 2) Run the mysql client with the supplied connection info and the single-line SQL using the -e option, so the statement executes noninteractively. 3) Parse the raw MySQL output you paste back and continue iterating until we reach the final answer. Please provide: - DB host (or socket) - port (if not 3306) - username - password (or indicate if blank/other auth) - database name (if applicable) - the exact question / SQL you want me to execute (or say that you want me to inspect schema first). If you want me to inspect schema first, tell me which database to use; I'll then produce a single-line SQL statement such as SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='your_db'; in the required markdown format. Example of the mysql command I will run once you give credentials: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<SQL_STATEMENT>\"\n\nSecurity note: if you prefer not to paste a password here, you can connect from your side and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will analyze it and tell you the next SQL to run.",
