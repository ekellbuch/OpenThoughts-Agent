  "analysis": "Current environment summary: the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No database has been connected to or queried in this session. Nothing has been changed in the database; we only prepared the client. To run SQL we need either (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) or (B) permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the necessary information:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote database: provide the DB connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database name) and the exact question you want answered. I will then prepare a single SQL statement (one-line) and present it in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block in markdown. You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, which I will analyze and iterate on until we can produce the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server here: confirm you want this and I will install mysql-server, initialize it, start it, create any necessary user/database, then run SQL as requested. Installing a server will take extra steps (apt-get install mysql-server, secure setup or user creation).\n\nNotes on how I'll format the SQL when you ask me to operate:\n- I will output exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block, on one line, and preceded by the line: Action: Operation\n- Example I would produce when ready:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\n(You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL response.)\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide either the remote DB credentials plus the precise question, or permission to install a local server and the question you want answered. If you prefer, you can also provide the exact SQL you want executed and I will format it according to the required pattern.",
