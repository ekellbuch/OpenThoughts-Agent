  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 (ID=ubuntu). No MySQL server is running locally, the mysql client is not installed, and there's no /var/lib/mysql. We have apt-get available so we can install a MySQL-compatible client to connect to a remote database (if you provide credentials) or to a locally started server (if you want to install & run a server). Nothing has been changed yet.",
  "plan": "I'll install a MySQL client so we can run SQL against a database. Steps: 1) update apt package lists; 2) install the default MySQL client package; 3) verify the client is installed by printing its version. After that I'll ask you for the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or for the SQL question you want answered so I can run the appropriate SQL statement.",
