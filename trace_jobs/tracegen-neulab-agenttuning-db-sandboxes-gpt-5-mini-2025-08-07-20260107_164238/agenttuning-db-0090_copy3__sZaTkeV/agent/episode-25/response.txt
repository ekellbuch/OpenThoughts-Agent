  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 in /app. The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote DB connection credentials, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that choice:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- I will then produce exactly one Action: Operation block containing one one-line SQL statement in a single markdown SQL code block (per your rules). You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output for me to analyze.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name you want created, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce one-line SQL operation blocks for you to execute (or run them here if you instruct me to).\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing exactly one SQL statement on one line).\n\nWhen you reply with your choice and the requested details I will produce the first Action: Operation (one-line SQL in a single markdown code block) or proceed with the installation steps if you choose Option B.",
