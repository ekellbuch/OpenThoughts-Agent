  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given a database question, an exact SQL statement to run, or remote DB connection credentials, nor have you authorized installing a local server. Therefore there is currently no target database to query and no operations have been performed against any database.",
  "plan": "I cannot run SQL until you choose one of these three options and provide the necessary details. Please reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested information for that option:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (use this if your data is on another host):\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or say you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- After you provide those, I will produce a single Action: Operation block containing exactly one one-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container (use this if you want a local DB here):\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- On confirmation I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operation blocks (one one-line statement each) for you to execute (or run them here if you instruct me to).\n\nOption C — You already have the exact single SQL statement to run now:\n- Paste exactly that single SQL statement (must be one statement). I will immediately wrap it into the required format: a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing exactly that one-line SQL statement.\n\nNext step: pick A, B, or C and provide the details requested above. After you respond I will prepare the first Action: Operation (or perform installation for B) accordingly.",
