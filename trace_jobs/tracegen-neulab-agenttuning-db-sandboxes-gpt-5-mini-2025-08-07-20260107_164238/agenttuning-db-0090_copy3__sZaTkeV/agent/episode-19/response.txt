  "analysis": "Current state: you are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql) and no SQL has been executed. I have not been given a database question, any SQL to run, nor remote database connection credentials. Because there is currently no target database to query, I cannot execute SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options so we can proceed. Tell me which you want and provide the requested details; then I will produce the next output formatted exactly per your rules.\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit or 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- After you provide that, I will produce exactly one 'Action: Operation' block containing a single one-line SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block. You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw mysql output. I will analyze it and either request another operation or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply that I should proceed with installing mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name you want created, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operations (one one-line statement each) in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute (or I can execute them here if you ask).\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required format: a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by one markdown SQL code block containing exactly that one-line SQL statement. You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nFormatting and process reminders:\n- Every operation I give will contain exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block and be preceded by the line: Action: Operation\n- When we are finished and confident of the answer, I will output: Action: Answer followed by Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", ...] exactly as you specified.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (remote credentials + question, or confirmation + init details for local server, or the exact SQL).",
