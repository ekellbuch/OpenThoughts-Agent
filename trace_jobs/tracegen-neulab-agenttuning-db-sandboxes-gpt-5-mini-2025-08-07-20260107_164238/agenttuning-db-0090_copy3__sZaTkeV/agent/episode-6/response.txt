  "analysis": "The container has mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no local MySQL server running and no database files. No SQL has been executed. To proceed I need either remote DB connection details (host, port, user, password, database) to connect with the mysql client, or explicit permission to install and start a local MySQL server in this container so we can create/query databases locally. At this point nothing further has been done because I await your choice and any needed credentials or instructions.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide connection details (host, optional port, user, password, database) and the exact question you want answered (or the SQL you want executed). Once you provide that, I will: (1) produce a single SQL statement formatted exactly as required (preceded by \"Action: Operation\" and with one SQL code block in markdown containing one-line SQL). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, which I will analyze and then either ask for another operation or commit the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server: confirm you want me to install mysql-server here. If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, create a user/database if you specify, then run SQL as requested. I will report each step and then, as in Option A, produce one SQL statement per operation for you to execute.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide either the remote DB credentials plus the question/SQL, or confirm installing a local server and the question/SQL to run. If you already have the exact SQL to run, paste it and I will format it according to the required pattern.",
