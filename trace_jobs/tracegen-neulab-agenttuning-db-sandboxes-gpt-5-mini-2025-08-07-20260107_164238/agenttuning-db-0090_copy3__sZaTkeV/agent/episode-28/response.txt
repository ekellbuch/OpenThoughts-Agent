  "analysis": "You're root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session and I have not received any remote DB credentials, an exact SQL statement to run, or explicit permission to install a local MySQL server. Therefore there is currently no target database to query.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick one of three options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that choice: \n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or state you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- I will produce a single operation formatted exactly as required: a line 'Action: Operation' followed by one markdown SQL code block containing a single one-line SQL statement. You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and supply any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- On confirmation I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operation blocks (one one-line statement each) formatted per your rules.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste the single SQL statement you want executed (it must be a single statement). I will immediately wrap it into the required format: a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by one markdown SQL code block containing exactly that one-line SQL statement.\n\nWhen you reply with one of the options and the required details I will produce the next Action: Operation (or perform installation for Option B).",
