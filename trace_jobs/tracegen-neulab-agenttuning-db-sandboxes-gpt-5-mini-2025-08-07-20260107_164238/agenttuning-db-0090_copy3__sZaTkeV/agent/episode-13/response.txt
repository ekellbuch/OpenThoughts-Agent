No SQL has been executed and I have not been given a database question, any SQL to run, or remote DB connection details. I cannot run any SQL against a database until you either (A) provide remote database connection information or (B) explicitly allow me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container and give any initialization details (user/password/database).",

Also provide any initial user (username/password) and database name you want created, and the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce one-line SQL operation blocks (formatted as above) for you to execute or for me to run here if you request.\n\nIf you already have the exact single SQL statement to run, paste it now and I will format it into the required Action: Operation block (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).",
