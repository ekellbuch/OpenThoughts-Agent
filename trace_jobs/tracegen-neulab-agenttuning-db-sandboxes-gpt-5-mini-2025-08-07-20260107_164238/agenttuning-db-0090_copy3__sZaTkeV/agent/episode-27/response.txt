  "analysis": "You're in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session and I have not been given any remote DB connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options so I can proceed: \n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive entry), database name, and the exact question you want answered or the exact single SQL statement to run. I will then produce exactly one operation formatted per your rules: a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing a one-line SQL statement. You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container: explicitly confirm you want me to install mysql-server and provide any initial username/password and database name to create plus the query/question to run. If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operation blocks (one one-line statement each) in the required format.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now: paste exactly the single SQL statement you want executed and I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the required details for that choice. After you provide that, I will produce the first Action: Operation (or perform the installation steps for Option B) as required.",
