  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed against any database in this session. I have not been given any remote database connection details, nor have you granted permission to install and run a local MySQL server. Therefore there is currently no target database to query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two clear paths so we can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide these details: host (or IP), port (omit or give 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL to run).\n- Once you provide that, I will prepare a single SQL statement that answers your question and present it exactly in the required format: a single line reading \"Action: Operation\" followed by one SQL code block in markdown containing exactly one SQL statement on one line. You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and either request another operation or supply the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to proceed with installing a server. Also tell me any initial username/password and database name you want created and the SQL question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then run SQL as needed. As above, each operation that runs SQL will be formatted exactly as \"Action: Operation\" followed by one-line SQL in a markdown code block.\n\nFormatting rules I will follow when operating:\n- Every operation will contain exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block and preceded by the line: Action: Operation\n- Example of an operation I will produce for you to execute (do not run anything until you see this pattern from me and execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block):\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\nNext step: Please reply with either:\n- (A) remote DB connection details + the exact question/SQL you want executed, or\n- (B) explicit confirmation to install a local MySQL server here and any initialization details (user/password/database) plus the query/question to run.\n\nWhen you provide that, I will produce the first Action: Operation block (one-line SQL in a single markdown code block) as required.",
