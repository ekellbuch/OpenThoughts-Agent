  "analysis": "You are at a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed and I have not been given a database question, SQL to run, or remote DB connection details. Because there is no target database, I cannot run any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will not change the environment without your instruction. Please choose one of the two options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit or 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL you want executed).\n- After you provide those details and the question, I will produce a single Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement on one line (a single SQL code block in markdown). You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and iterate or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Explicitly confirm you want me to install mysql-server. Also provide any initial user (username/password) and database name you want created, and the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operation blocks (one SQL statement per operation) in the required format for you to execute (or I can run them here if you instruct me to).\n\nIf you already have the exact single SQL statement to run, paste it now and I will format it into the required Action: Operation block (one-line SQL in a single markdown code block).",
