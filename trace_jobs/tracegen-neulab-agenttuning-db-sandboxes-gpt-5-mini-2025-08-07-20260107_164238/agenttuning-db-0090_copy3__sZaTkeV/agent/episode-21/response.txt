  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote database connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, I cannot run any SQL against data yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options so I can proceed. Please reply with exactly one of the following and the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered or the exact single SQL statement to run.\n- After you provide that, I will produce exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single one-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will execute the installation and initialization steps here and then produce the SQL operations (one statement per operation) in the required format.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block) and nothing else.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details; I will then produce the next Action: Operation SQL block (or perform the install steps if you choose Option B).",
