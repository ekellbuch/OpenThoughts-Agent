  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session and I have not been given any remote database connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, or explicit permission to install a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, I cannot run any SQL against data yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following two options so I can proceed. After you pick, I will produce the single SQL operation (one-line SQL inside the required Action: Operation code block) for you to run and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- You must provide: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL you want executed).\n- Once provided, I will craft a single SQL statement that answers the question, and present it exactly in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block containing one one-line SQL statement). Example of the client invocation you (or I) would use to run that SQL non-interactively (do not run until you receive the Action: Operation block):\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n- After you execute the SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will analyze it and either request another operation or provide the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply that I should proceed and provide any desired initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the question/SQL to run.\n- If you confirm, I will run: apt-get update; DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server; initialize/start the server; create any specified user and database; then run the queries you request. I will report each step and then produce a single SQL statement per operation in the required Action: Operation format for you to execute (or run them here if you instruct me to). Installing the server is a multi-step action and will take longer than client-only operations.\n\nIf you already have the exact single SQL statement you want executed now, paste that SQL and I will wrap it immediately into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).",
