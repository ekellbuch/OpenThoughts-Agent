  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and functioning. There is no local MySQL server running and no /var/lib/mysql directory. No SQL has been executed in this session and I have not been given a database question, any SQL to run, or any remote database connection credentials. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to pick exactly one of three options so I can proceed. Reply with your choice and the requested details for that choice. After you provide the details I will produce a single Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement (one-line SQL inside a single markdown code block) per your rules.\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or state you will enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run. If confirmed I will install and initialize mysql-server and then run queries as requested.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly the single SQL statement (must be one statement). I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).\n\nAfter you choose and provide the necessary details, I will produce the Action: Operation SQL block for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze that output and continue until we reach a final Action: Answer.",
