  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given a database question, an exact SQL statement to run, nor remote database connection credentials. Because there is currently no target database to query, I cannot execute any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your instruction on one of these choices so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (omit or give 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), and the database name. Also provide the exact question you want answered or the exact single SQL statement to run.\n- When you provide that, I will produce exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single one-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will run only the SQL inside the first SQL code block I give and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and continue or give the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to proceed. Also specify any initial username/password and database name to create, and the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server (apt-get install mysql-server), start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operation blocks (one SQL statement per operation) formatted as required for you to execute (or I can run them here if you ask).\n\nOption C — If you already have the exact single SQL statement to run, paste that SQL now and I will format it into the required Action: Operation (one SQL statement inside a one-line markdown code block) and nothing else.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (credentials/question or confirmation to install a local server). After that I will produce the next Action: Operation block with the single SQL statement to execute.",
