Before I can run SQL or answer a DB question I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running in the container, whether the mysql client is available, and what credentials or socket are present. Nothing has been accomplished yet; next steps are to inspect the environment and services so we can connect to the database.",
  "plan": "I will gather environment and service information to locate a MySQL server and the client. Specifically I will: 1) confirm identity and current directory; 2) list files in the working directory to see project files; 3) check running processes for mysqld/mysql; 4) check whether the mysql client is installed (mysql -V); 5) inspect /var/lib/mysql for data files (if present); 6) show any MYSQL-related environment variables; 7) list listening TCP sockets to see if MySQL is listening on its port. These commands will help determine how to connect (socket, TCP, credentials). After that I'll ask you the specific DB question or, if you already provided it, proceed to run a SQL statement.",
