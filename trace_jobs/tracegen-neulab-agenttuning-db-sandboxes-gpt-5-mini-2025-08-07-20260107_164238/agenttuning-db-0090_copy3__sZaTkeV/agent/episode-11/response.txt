  "analysis": "Current state: you are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working, but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No database has been connected to or queried in this session. I have not run any SQL against a database because you have not provided either (A) remote database connection details or (B) permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server here. You also have not provided the specific database question or SQL to execute. In short: the client is ready, but there is no target database to query yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the two allowed workflows and provide the necessary information. I will not change or install anything unless you explicitly permit it. Choose one of the following and reply accordingly:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (omit or 3306 for default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), and the database name. Also give the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL you want executed).\n- Once you provide that, I will prepare exactly one SQL statement per operation and output it in the required format:\n  - A single line reading: Action: Operation\n  - Immediately followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing exactly one SQL statement on one line (no other text in that block). Example:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\n- You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze that output and either produce another operation or commit the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply that I should proceed with installing a local server. Also supply any requested initial user/database to create (username, password, database name) and the exact question/SQL you want executed.\n- If you confirm, I will: apt-get install mysql-server, initialize/start the server, create the requested user/database (if you specify), and then produce SQL operations in the required format for you to run or I can run them here if you instruct me to do so.\n\nAdditional notes and examples:\n- If you want me to run a simple query against a remote DB non-interactively, the client command pattern is: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\" (but I will only produce the SQL inside the Action: Operation block; you will actually execute it).\n- If you already have the exact SQL statement you want executed, paste that SQL now. I will wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement per operation) and nothing else.\n\nNext step required from you: pick Option A or B and provide either the remote DB credentials + the exact question/SQL, or the explicit confirmation to install a local server + any initialization details and the question/SQL to run.",
