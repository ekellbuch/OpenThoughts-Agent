  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no database files in /var/lib/mysql. No SQL has been executed. I cannot run any SQL until you either provide remote database connection details or confirm you want a local MySQL server installed and initialized. You also haven't provided the specific database question you want answered.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide: host, port (if not 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL you want executed). \n- I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing one-line SQL in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze and iterate.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply that I should proceed. Also specify any initial database/user to create (username, password, database name) and the query or question to run.\n- I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce one-line SQL operation blocks for you to execute (or execute them here if you ask).\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the necessary connection details or confirmation and the exact question (or SQL) to run. Once you do, I will produce the first Action: Operation SQL block (exactly one SQL statement in a single-line markdown code block) for you to execute.",
