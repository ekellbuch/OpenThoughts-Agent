  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no /var/lib/mysql data directory. No SQL has been executed and I have not been given any remote database connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, or explicit permission to install a local MySQL server. In short: the client is ready but there is no target database to query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these actions and provide the required details:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host (or IP), port (omit or 3306 for default), username, password (or indicate interactive entry), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run). I will then produce exactly one operation formatted as required (a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing one one-line SQL statement). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw mysql output; I will parse it and continue or produce the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server here: explicitly confirm you want me to install mysql-server. Also specify any initial user (username/password) and database name to create and the question/SQL to run. If confirmed, I will install and initialize the server, start it, create the requested user/database, then run queries as needed. Each SQL run will be provided as a single Action: Operation with one one-line SQL statement in a markdown code block.\n\nOption C — If you already have the exact single SQL statement to run, paste it now and I will immediately format it into the required Action: Operation (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply the necessary details; I will then produce the first Action: Operation SQL block.",
