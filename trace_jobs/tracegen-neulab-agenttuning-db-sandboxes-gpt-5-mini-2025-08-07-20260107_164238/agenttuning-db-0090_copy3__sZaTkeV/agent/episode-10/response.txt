  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 and the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and no database files under /var/lib/mysql. No SQL has been executed and I have no connection details or a database question from you. Nothing further can be done until you either (A) provide remote database connection details and the precise question/SQL to run, or (B) confirm you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container and specify any initial user/database and the question/SQL to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two workflows and provide the required information:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide: host, port (omit or 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll provide it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL you want executed).\n- I will then produce a single Action: Operation containing one-line SQL in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue until we can produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to proceed. Also specify any initial username/password and database name to create, and the query/question to run.\n- I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, then produce one-line SQL operation blocks for you to execute (or run them here if you ask).\n\nIf you already have the exact SQL you want executed, paste it and I will format it as the required Action: Operation (one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block).",
