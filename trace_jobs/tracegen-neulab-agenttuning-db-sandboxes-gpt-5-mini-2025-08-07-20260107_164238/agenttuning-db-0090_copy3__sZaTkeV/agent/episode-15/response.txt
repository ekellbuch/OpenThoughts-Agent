  "analysis": "You're in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session and I have not been given any remote database connection details, a specific SQL statement, or permission to install a local MySQL server. Therefore there is currently no database target to query.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of two paths so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), and database name. Also provide the exact question you want answered or the exact single SQL statement to run.\n- Once you provide that, I will produce exactly one operation formatted per your rules: a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single SQL code block in markdown containing exactly one SQL statement on one line. You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want me to proceed with installing mysql-server. Also specify any initial username, password, and database name to create, and the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce one-line SQL operation blocks (formatted as above) for you to execute (or I can run them here if you instruct me to).\n\nIf you already have the exact single SQL statement you want executed, paste it now and I will wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).",
