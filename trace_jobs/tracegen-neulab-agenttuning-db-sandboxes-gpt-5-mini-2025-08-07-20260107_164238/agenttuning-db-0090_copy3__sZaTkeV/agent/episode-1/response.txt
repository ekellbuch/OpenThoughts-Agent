  "analysis": "From the previous commands I see: you are root in /app, there are no files there, no mysqld/mysql processes are running, the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No MYSQL-related environment variables are set, and nothing is listening on port 3306. In short: there is no local MySQL server or client available in this container right now. To run SQL against a MySQL database we need a client (or a running server plus client). If the database is remote, I'll need connection details (host, port, user, password, database). If it's supposed to be local, we must install and/or start a server and then use a client.",
  "plan": "Next I'll detect the OS / package manager so we can install a MySQL-compatible client. I will: 1) show /etc/os-release to detect the distribution; 2) check for common package managers (apt-get, yum, apk); 3) list /etc/issue as a hint; after you review that output I'll either install a client (via the detected package manager) or you can provide remote DB credentials if you want to connect to an external server. I won't attempt to install anything until we confirm the package manager/environment.",
