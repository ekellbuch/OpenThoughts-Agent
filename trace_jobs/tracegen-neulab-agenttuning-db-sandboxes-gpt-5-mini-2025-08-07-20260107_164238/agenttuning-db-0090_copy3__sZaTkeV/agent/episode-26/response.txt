  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 at /app. The MySQL client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote database connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because no target database is available, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three clear options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the requested details for that choice:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive entry), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run). I will then produce one Action: Operation block containing exactly one one-line SQL statement (in a single markdown SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run. I will install and initialize the server, create the requested user/database, then produce SQL operation blocks as required.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).\n\nAfter you provide one of the above choices and the necessary details, I will produce the first Action: Operation (one-line SQL in the required format) or perform the installation steps if you choose Option B.",
