At this point we can only run SQL against a MySQL server if you provide connection details for a remote server (host, port, user, password, database) or if you ask me to install and start a local server in this container. No SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any more system commands until you tell me which of the two workflows you want: (A) connect to a remote MySQL server — if so, provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the exact question you want answered; I will then produce a single Action: Operation SQL statement in the required format (one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output; or (B) set up a local MySQL server here — if so, tell me to proceed and I will install and initialize a server and then run SQL. If you choose A, also tell me whether to use mysql client options (e.g., --ssl-mode) and any schema/table names. If you prefer, provide the exact SQL you want run and I will wrap it per the instructions. Example of how I will format the operation when ready: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL block in markdown.",
