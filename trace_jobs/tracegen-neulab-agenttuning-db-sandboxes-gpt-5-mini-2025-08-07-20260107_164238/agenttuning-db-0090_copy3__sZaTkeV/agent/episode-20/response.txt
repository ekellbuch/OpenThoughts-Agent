  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44), but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote DB connection credentials, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, I cannot execute SQL against data yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these three clear options. I list the exact commands I will run for each option so you can approve or modify them before I execute anything.\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- You provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive prompt), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- After you provide those, I will produce a single Action: Operation block containing exactly one SQL statement (one-line SQL in a single markdown code block) as required. Example client command you (or I) would run locally to execute the SQL non-interactively (I will not run it until you request it):\n  mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- If you confirm, I will run these commands to install, start, and secure a local server and create a user/database you specify. Example sequence I will run (I will ask for confirmation and credentials before running):\n  apt-get update\n  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  systemctl start mysql || mysqld_safe &\n  # Then create user/database as requested, e.g.:\n  mysql -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydb; CREATE USER 'alice'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass'; GRANT ALL ON mydb.* TO 'alice'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"\n- After it's running and you provide the question, I will produce a single Action: Operation block (one SQL statement) for you to execute, or I can run it here if you instruct me to.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing exactly one SQL statement on one line). You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block I give and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nNext step required from you: pick Option A, B, or C and either provide the remote DB credentials and the exact question/SQL (Option A), confirm I should install a local server and give any initialization details (Option B), or paste the exact single SQL you want run now (Option C). Once you provide that, I will produce the Action: Operation block (one-line SQL in a single markdown code block) as required.",
