  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04. The mysql client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working, but there is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed and I have not been given any database question, any SQL to run, nor any remote DB connection credentials. Because there is currently no target database to query, I cannot run SQL against data yet.",
  "plan": "I will not change the environment without your instruction. Please pick one of these three options and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit or specify 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one operation formatted per your rules: a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing exactly one one-line SQL statement. You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and continue or provide the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply that I should proceed and supply any initial username, password, and database name you want created, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operations (one one-line statement each) in the required format for you to execute (or run them here if you request).\n\nOption C — You already have the exact single SQL statement to run now:\n- Paste exactly that single SQL statement. I will immediately wrap it into the required 'Action: Operation' format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block). You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nImportant process reminders:\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per operation, inside the first SQL code block, and nothing else in that block.\n- After you run the SQL and paste the raw MySQL output here, I will parse and analyze it and either ask for further operations or produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and the required details for that choice so I can prepare the next Action: Operation (or proceed with installation for Option B).",
