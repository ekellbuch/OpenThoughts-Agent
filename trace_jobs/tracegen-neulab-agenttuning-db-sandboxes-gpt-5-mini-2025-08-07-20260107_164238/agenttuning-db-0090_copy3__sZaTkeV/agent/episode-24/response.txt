  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 inside the container (/app). The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote database connection credentials, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations have been performed and none can be performed until you provide credentials, an SQL statement, or permission to install a server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options and provide the required details. Depending on your choice I will produce exactly one SQL statement per operation formatted as you specified (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with a single SQL code block containing exactly one one-line SQL statement). Options:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- You provide: host (or IP), port (omit for default 3306), username, password (or indicate interactive entry), database name, and the exact question you want answered or the exact single SQL statement to run.\n- I will then produce a single Action: Operation block containing the one-line SQL that answers the question.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- On confirmation I will install and initialize mysql-server and create the requested user/database, then produce the SQL operation(s) as needed.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly the single SQL statement you want executed and I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block).\n\nPlease reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and include the required details for that choice. After you do, I will produce the first Action: Operation SQL block (or perform the installation steps for Option B) as required.",
