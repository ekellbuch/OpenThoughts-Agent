  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container at /app. The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and no SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote DB connection credentials, an exact SQL statement to run, or explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no further DB operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options. After you pick, I will proceed and produce the single SQL operation (one-line SQL inside the required Action: Operation block) or perform the installation steps if you choose a local server. Please reply with exactly one choice and the requested details:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if your data is external):\n- Provide: host (or IP), port (omit or 3306 if default), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- Once you provide that, I will craft one SQL statement that answers your question and output it in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing exactly one one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the SQL inside that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any desired initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will run the necessary apt commands to install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce one-line SQL operation blocks for you to execute (or run them here if you instruct me to). Example commands I would run (after your confirmation):\n  - apt-get update\n  - DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  - start/enable the server, then create users/databases via mysql -e \"CREATE DATABASE ...; CREATE USER ...; GRANT ...; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block). You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nNotes about the process:\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per operation, inside the first SQL code block, and nothing else in that block.\n- After you run the SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse and analyze it and either ask for another operation or produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details so I can prepare the next Action: Operation or perform the installation steps.",
