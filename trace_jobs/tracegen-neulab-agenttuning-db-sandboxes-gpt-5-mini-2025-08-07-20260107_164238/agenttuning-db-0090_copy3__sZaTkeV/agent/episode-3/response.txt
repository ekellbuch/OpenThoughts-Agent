  "analysis": "The mysql client has just been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is still no local MySQL server running and no database files in /var/lib/mysql; therefore we cannot query a local server. To proceed I need either: (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server (host, port, user, password, database) so I can run queries against it with the mysql client, or (B) instructions to install and start a local MySQL server in this container. Nothing has been queried yet because no SQL has been provided and no connection details are available.",
  "plan": "1) Show the mysql client usage summary so you can see how to connect from this shell. 2) Ask you to provide the DB question you want answered and the connection details (host, port, user, password, database). After you provide those, I will produce a single SQL statement inside the required Action: Operation code block (one-line SQL in markdown). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze it and either ask further operations or, when confident, produce the final Action: Answer response. If you prefer a local DB, tell me and I will install and initialize a server instead.",
