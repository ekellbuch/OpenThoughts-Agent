  "analysis": "Current state: you are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running here and no /var/lib/mysql data directory. No SQL has been executed. To proceed we must either (A) connect to a remote MySQL server you control, or (B) install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You have not yet provided a database question, SQL, or any connection details or confirmation to install a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the two workflows and provide the necessary information. After you provide details I will produce exactly one SQL statement per operation in the required format (preceded by the line 'Action: Operation' and with one SQL code block in markdown containing the single-line SQL). Options and what I will do for each:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- You provide: host, port (optional, default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL to run).\n- I will prepare a single SQL statement that answers the question (or the SQL you provided) and present it in the required Action: Operation format. You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will analyze the output and either produce another operation or give the final answer.\n- Typical client invocation you (or I) would run locally to execute the SQL I provide: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' <database> -e \"<SQL>\" (but I will not run it until you execute the SQL block I provide).\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server here:\n- Confirm you want me to install mysql-server. If you confirm, I will: apt-get update; apt-get install -y mysql-server; initialize/start the server; create any user/database you request; then run SQL.\n- After the server is running and any needed user/db created, I will produce a single SQL statement per operation in the required format for you to execute (or I can execute it locally if you prefer me to run commands in the container).\n\nNotes and requirements I will follow when operating:\n- Every operation will contain exactly one SQL statement inside a single markdown code block and preceded by the line: Action: Operation\n- You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block I give and return the raw MySQL output. I will parse that and continue.\n\nPlease reply with one of the following:\n1) For Option A: provide remote DB connection details (host, optional port, user, password or indicate interactive), the database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the SQL to run). OR\n2) For Option B: confirm I should install a local MySQL server here, and tell me any user/database you want created and the SQL question to run.\n\nOnce you respond I will prepare the first Action: Operation with a single SQL statement (if applicable).",
