  "analysis": "You are in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 inside the container (/app). The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44) and functional. There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote DB connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of three options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and provide the requested details for that choice. After you provide the required details I will produce the next output formatted exactly as you required (when operating I will output a single SQL statement per operation inside a markdown SQL code block, preceded by the line 'Action: Operation').\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or state you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run. If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce the SQL operation(s) as required.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly that single SQL statement (must be one statement). I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (a single-line SQL statement inside a single markdown SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOnce you pick A, B, or C and provide the required details I will prepare the first Action: Operation (one SQL statement) for you to run and return the raw MySQL output so I can analyze and continue.",
