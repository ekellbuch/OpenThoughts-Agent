  "analysis": "You are root in an Ubuntu 24.04 container (/app). The mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no local MySQL server running and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. No SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote DB connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options so I can proceed. Please reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and provide the requested details for that choice:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you will enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single one-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will execute only the SQL inside the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will install and initialize mysql-server, start it, create the requested user/database, and then produce SQL operation blocks (one one-line statement each) in the required format for you to execute (or run them here if you instruct me to).\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly the single SQL statement you want executed. I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (one SQL statement inside a single-line markdown code block) and nothing else.\n\nWhen you reply with one of these options and the required details, I will produce the next Action: Operation (or perform the installation steps for Option B).",
