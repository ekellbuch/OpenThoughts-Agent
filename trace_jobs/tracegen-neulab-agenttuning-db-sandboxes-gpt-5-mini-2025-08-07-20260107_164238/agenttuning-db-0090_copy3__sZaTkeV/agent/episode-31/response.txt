  "analysis": "You're in a root shell on Ubuntu 24.04 at /app. The MySQL client (mysql 8.0.44) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql) and no SQL has been executed in this session. I have not been given any remote database connection details, an exact SQL statement to run, nor explicit permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server. Because there is currently no target database to query, no database operations can be performed yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of three options so I can proceed. Reply with exactly one choice (A, B, or C) and provide the required details for that choice:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n- Provide: host (or IP), optional port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you'll enter it interactively), database name, and the exact question you want answered (or the exact single SQL statement to run).\n- After you provide those, I will produce exactly one Action: Operation block containing a single one-line SQL statement (in a single markdown SQL code block) that you will execute and return the raw MySQL output for me to analyze.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Reply with explicit confirmation to install mysql-server and provide any initial username, password, and database name to create, plus the query/question to run.\n- If you confirm, I will run the install/init/start steps here, create the requested user/database, and then produce one-line SQL operation blocks (each preceded by the required 'Action: Operation' line and containing exactly one SQL statement) for you to execute or for me to execute here if you ask.\n\nOption C — You already have the exact SQL to run now:\n- Paste exactly that single SQL statement (must be one statement). I will immediately wrap it into the required Action: Operation format (a single line 'Action: Operation' followed by a single markdown SQL code block containing exactly that one-line SQL statement).\n\nNotes:\n- I will only ever provide one SQL statement per operation inside the first SQL code block.\n- After you run the SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back here, I will parse and analyze it and either request another operation or produce the final Action: Answer.\n\nPlease reply with exactly one of: (A) remote connection details + question/SQL, (B) confirmation to install local server + initialization details + question, or (C) the exact single SQL statement to run now.",
