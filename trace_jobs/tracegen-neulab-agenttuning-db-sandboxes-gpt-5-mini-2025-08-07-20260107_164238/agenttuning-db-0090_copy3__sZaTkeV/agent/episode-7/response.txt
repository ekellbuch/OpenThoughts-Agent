  "analysis": "The environment has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no local MySQL server running and no database files in /var/lib/mysql. No SQL has been executed against any database. To run queries we need either (A) connection details for a remote MySQL server or (B) permission to install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container. You have not yet provided a database question, credentials, or asked to install a local server, so I cannot issue any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the two workflows and provide necessary information:\n\nOption A — Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide the connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password, and database name) and the exact question you want answered (or the exact SQL you want executed). Once you provide those, I will produce one Action: Operation block containing a single one-line SQL statement in a markdown code block (per your rules). You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze it and continue until we can produce a final Action: Answer.\n\nOption B — Install and run a local MySQL server here: explicitly tell me to proceed. I will install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create any user/database you request, and then run SQL as you instruct. I will report each installation step and then produce one SQL statement per operation as above.\n\nIf you already have the exact SQL you want run, paste it and I will format it into the required Action: Operation (a single SQL statement in a one-line markdown code block). Note: I will only include one SQL statement per operation and you will execute only the first SQL block I provide.",
