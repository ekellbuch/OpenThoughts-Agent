  "analysis": "You are at a shell prompt (root@270fcb2b13dc:/app). No prior MySQL queries or database actions have been executed in this session. I cannot see any database output yet. Before I can run SQL or answer any database question, I need to discover whether a MySQL server or client is present and accessible in this environment, and locate database files or connection info. No question from you has been provided yet, so I will first inspect the environment and check for MySQL/mysqld presence, client availability, and common data directories. Once I know how to connect, you can give the database question and I will run a single SQL statement per your rules.",
  "plan": "1) Check current user and working directory to confirm context (whoami, pwd). 2) List files in the current directory to see if any SQL or project files exist. 3) Check for running MySQL-related processes (mysqld/mysql) to determine if a server is running. 4) Check whether the MySQL client is installed (mysql --version). 5) Inspect /var/lib/mysql to see if database files exist. 6) Report OS info (cat /etc/os-release). After these checks, I will report back and ask you for the specific database question or connection credentials. Each command is chosen to reveal environment and MySQL availability without making changes.",
