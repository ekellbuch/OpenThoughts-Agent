  "analysis": "You are root in /app on an Ubuntu 24.04 container. There is no MySQL client or server installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, and no /var/lib/mysql directory. I cannot run any SQL against a database in this environment until I have either: (A) connection details for an external MySQL server you want me to query, (B) a SQL dump or database files present in the container to inspect, or (C) permission to install a MySQL client or server locally in the container.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of the following options and then proceed accordingly:\n1) Provide the database question plus connection details: host, port, user, password, database. If you provide these, I will produce a single SQL statement to run (per your rules) and then interpret the returned output.\n2) Provide a path to a SQL dump or database files inside the container. If provided, I will inspect them and then run SQL as needed.\n3) Reply 'install client' to let me install the MySQL client (to connect to external servers) — I will run apt-get to install the client and then continue.\n4) Reply 'install server' to let me install a local MySQL/MariaDB server (I will install, initialize, and optionally load example data). This is more invasive and slower; confirm if you want this.\n\nTell me which option you choose and, if applicable, provide credentials or file paths. Once you provide that, I will either (A) compose exactly one SQL statement in the required markdown single-line format (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or (B) install the requested packages and then proceed.",
