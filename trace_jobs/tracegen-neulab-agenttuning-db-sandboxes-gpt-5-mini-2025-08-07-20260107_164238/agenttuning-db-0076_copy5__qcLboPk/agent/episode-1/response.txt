  "analysis": "You're in a root shell at /app. Previous checks show there is no mysql client binary available (mysql: command not found) and no mysqld/mariadbd process is running. The working directory /app is empty. I need to determine whether any MySQL data files, configuration, or sockets exist on the filesystem (which might indicate a local server), or whether a remote MySQL server must be contacted. Also, you haven't yet given the specific question about the database you want answered (which table, schema, or query goal).",
  "plan": "I will look for common MySQL/MariaDB locations and any listening MySQL ports/sockets. Specifically I'll: (1) list /var/lib/mysql to see if local database files exist; (2) list /etc/mysql for configuration files; (3) list /var/run/mysqld for unix socket files; (4) check listening TCP ports to see if anything is bound to 3306; (5) do a shallow search for any .sql files in the top of the filesystem. These checks will tell us whether a local server or DB files exist. After that I'll report results and ask for the specific question to run SQL against the database, or propose how to install/connect to a server if none exists.",
