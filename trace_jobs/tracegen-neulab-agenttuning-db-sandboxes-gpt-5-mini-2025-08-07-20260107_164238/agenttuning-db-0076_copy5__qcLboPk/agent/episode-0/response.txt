  "analysis": "You're in a root shell inside /app. The terminal shows no prior commands' output. There is no visible MySQL client or database connection yet. Before I can run any SQL, I need to confirm whether a MySQL client is available, whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running, and where the database files/config are. No user question has been provided yet that specifies which database/table to query or what question to answer.",
  "plan": "I'll run a few lightweight inspection commands to determine the environment: current directory, list files, running processes (to see if a DB server is running), whether the mysql client binary exists, and its version. Based on results I'll ask you for the specific question or attempt to connect to MySQL. Commands to run: 1) pwd — confirm location. 2) ls -la — see files in /app. 3) ps aux | head -n 40 — check for mysqld or mariadbd processes. 4) which mysql — check for mysql client. 5) mysql --version — get client version if present. Each command is short and non-destructive.",
