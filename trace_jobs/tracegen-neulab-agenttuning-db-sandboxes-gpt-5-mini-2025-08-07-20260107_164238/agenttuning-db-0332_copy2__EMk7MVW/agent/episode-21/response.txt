  "analysis": "You are at a root shell inside the container where MySQL server and client are installed and running. The mysqld process is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock; the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, database name, or table name has been provided by you in this session, so no further SQL has been executed. What has been accomplished: installed client/server, started mysqld, verified connectivity, and confirmed available system databases. What still needs to be done: you must specify the exact database task (e.g., which database/tables/queries or DML/DDL you want) so I can run the appropriate SQL statements and produce an answer.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Provide one clear request (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; \n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" — I'll run DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; \n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" — provide the columns and condition and I'll run the SELECT; \n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" — provide the exact DML you want applied.\n\nWhen you give the exact question I will: (1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and (2) either perform one SQL operation (I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want me to inspect schema first but don't specify a database, I will default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; unless you tell me otherwise. Note: root currently has an empty password (insecure); avoid exposing this server externally.",
