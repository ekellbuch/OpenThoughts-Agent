Possible options you can request (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" (I will run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database X\" (I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM X;)\n- \"Describe table X.Y\" (I will run: DESCRIBE X.Y;)\n- \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\" (give the condition and columns)\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (give the exact changes)\n\nWhen you specify the exact question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed.",
