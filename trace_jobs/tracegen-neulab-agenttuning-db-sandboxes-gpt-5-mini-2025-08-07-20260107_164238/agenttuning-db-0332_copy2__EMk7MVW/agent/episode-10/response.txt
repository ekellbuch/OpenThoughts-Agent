  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There is currently no user-provided question or target database/table, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request: 1) \"List databases\" (I'll run SHOW DATABASES;). 2) \"List tables in database X\" (I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM X;). 3) \"Describe table X.Y\" (I'll run DESCRIBE X.Y;). 4) \"Run SELECT on X.Y where ...\" (give the condition). 5) \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (give exact changes). When you state the question I will: (a) explain my understanding and any assumptions about database/table/column names, and (b) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement using the required format: Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block) or give the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is necessary. If you want schema discovery I recommend starting with SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; — tell me which database to inspect or ask me to proceed with that.",
