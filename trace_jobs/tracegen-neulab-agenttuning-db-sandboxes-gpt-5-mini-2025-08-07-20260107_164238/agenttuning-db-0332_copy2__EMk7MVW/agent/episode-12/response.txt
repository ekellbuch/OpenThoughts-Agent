  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running inside the container. The mysqld process is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The mysql client connects as root with an empty password (the server was initialized insecurely). A previous test returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, database name, or table name has been provided, so no further SQL operations have been performed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or the specific action you want me to perform. Examples you can request: \n- \"List databases\" (I will run SHOW DATABASES;) \n- \"List tables in database X\" (I will run SHOW TABLES FROM X;) \n- \"Describe table X.Y\" (I will run DESCRIBE X.Y;) \n- \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\" (provide the condition and any columns to return) \n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (provide exact changes)\n\nWhen you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant; 2) choose to either Operate (run exactly one SQL statement) or Answer (give the final answer). If I Operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its output; I will then interpret the output and continue iterating until the task is complete.\n\nNotes and recommendations before we proceed: root currently has no password (insecure) — avoid exposing this server externally. If you want schema discovery, a good first operation is: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; (replace <database> with e.g. mysql or any other database you want to inspect). Tell me exactly what you want me to do next.",
