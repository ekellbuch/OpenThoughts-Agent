The mysqld process is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock; the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, target database, or table name has been provided in this session, so no further SQL operations have been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" (I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" (I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;)\n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" (I'll run: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;)\n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" (provide the columns and condition)\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" (provide the exact DML)\n\nWhen you provide the specific question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) choose to either Operate (run exactly one SQL statement and present it in the required format) or Answer (provide the final answer). If you want schema discovery first but don't specify a database, I will default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; unless you tell me otherwise.",
