A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, target database, or table name has been provided by you in this session, so no further SQL operations have been performed.",

Examples you can request (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" (I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" (I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;)\n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" (I'll run: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;)\n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" (provide the columns and condition)\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" (provide the exact DML)\n\nWhen you provide the specific question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed.",
