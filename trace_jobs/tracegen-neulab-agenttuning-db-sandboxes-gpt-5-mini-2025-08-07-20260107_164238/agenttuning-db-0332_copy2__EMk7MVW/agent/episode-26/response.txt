The mysqld process is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock; the mysql client can connect as root without a password (the server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. You have not provided a specific database question, database name, or table name to act on, so no SQL statement is pending execution.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want done with the database. Pick one clear request (or provide details):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>; \n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; \n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" — provide the columns and condition and I'll run the SELECT\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" — provide the exact DML to apply\n\nWhen you provide the request I will (1) explain my understanding and any assumptions, and (2) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want me to start schema discovery but don't provide a database, I can default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; — tell me whether to do that.",
