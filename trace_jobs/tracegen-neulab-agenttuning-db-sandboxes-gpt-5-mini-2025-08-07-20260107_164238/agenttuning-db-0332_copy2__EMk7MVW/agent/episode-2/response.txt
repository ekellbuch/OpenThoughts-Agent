  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). Attempting to connect failed because there is no local MySQL server running (socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock missing). To operate on a database we need a running server. No database credentials or remote host were provided, so the practical next step is to install and start a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container and then run SQL against it.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL server package (default-mysql-server) using apt so a mysqld instance is available. 2) Start the MySQL service. 3) Verify mysqld is running. 4) Connect with the mysql client and run SHOW DATABASES; to confirm we can execute SQL. If the server uses socket auth for root, connecting as root locally should work; if not, we'll inspect error output and adjust.",
