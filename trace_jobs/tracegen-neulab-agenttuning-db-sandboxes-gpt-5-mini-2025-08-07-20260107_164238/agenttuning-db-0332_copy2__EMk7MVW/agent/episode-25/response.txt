  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in a container where I installed the MySQL client and server. mysqld is running and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock; the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, target database, or table name has been provided, so no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;\n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" — provide the columns and conditions;\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" — provide the exact DML you want applied.\n\nWhen you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform a single SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide a final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want schema discovery first and don't specify a database, I will default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; unless you tell me otherwise.",
