A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There is no user-provided database question or target database/table to act on, so no further SQL should be run yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or action you want (examples: \"List databases\", \"List tables in database X\", \"Describe table X.Y\", \"SELECT ... FROM X.Y WHERE ...\", or an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). When you provide that question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want schema discovery first, say which database to inspect (or ask me to run SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;) and I will issue that single SQL statement in the next round.",
