  "analysis": "The container shell shows that the mysql client is not installed (commands mysql --version and mysql -uroot failed with \"command not found\"). No MySQL connection can be made until a client is available. I don't yet know the Linux distribution or which package manager is present, and network access to install packages may or may not be available. To proceed I must detect the OS/package manager and attempt to install a MySQL/MariaDB client so I can run SQL queries.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect /etc/os-release to learn the distribution. 2) Check for common package managers (apt-get, apt, yum, apk). 3) Use a single conditional install command that chooses the appropriate package manager to install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client or mariadb-client). 4) Verify installation by running mysql --version. 5) If installed, try a simple SHOW DATABASES query to confirm connectivity. If installation fails, report that and stop so you can advise next steps.",
