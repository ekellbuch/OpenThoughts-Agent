I don't yet know the Linux distribution or which package manager is present, and network access to install packages may or may not be available. To proceed I must detect the OS/package manager and attempt to install a MySQL/MariaDB client so I can run SQL queries.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"1) Inspect /etc/os-release to learn the distribution. 2) Check for common package managers (apt-get, apt, yum, apk). 3) Use a single conditional install command that chooses the appropriate package manager to install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client or mariadb-client). 4) Verify installation by running mysql --version. 5) If installed, try a simple SHOW DATABASES query to confirm connectivity. If installation fails, report that and stop so you can advise next steps.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat /etc/os-release\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which apt-get\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which apt\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which yum\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which apk\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"bash -lc 'if command -v apt-get >/dev/null 2>&1; then apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client; elif command -v apt >/dev/null 2>&1; then apt update && apt install -y default-mysql-client; elif command -v yum >/dev/null 2>&1; then yum install -y mariadb; elif command -v apk >/dev/null 2>&1; then apk add --no-cache mariadb-client; else echo no_supported_pm; fi'\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 30.0\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mysql --version\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 1.0\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mysql -uroot -e \\\\\\\"SHOW DATABASES;\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 1.0\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"annotations\": [], \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1767822333, \"model\": \"gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 1831, \"prompt_tokens\": 1308, \"total_tokens\": 3139, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 1280, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}",
