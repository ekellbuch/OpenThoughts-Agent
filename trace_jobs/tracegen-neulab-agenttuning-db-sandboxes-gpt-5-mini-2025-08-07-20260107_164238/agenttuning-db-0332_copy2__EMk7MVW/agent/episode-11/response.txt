The mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (the server was initialized insecurely). A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There is currently no specific database question or target database/table provided by you, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request: 1) \"List databases\" (I'll run SHOW DATABASES;). 2) \"List tables in database X\" (I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM X;). 3) \"Describe table X.Y\" (I'll run DESCRIBE X.Y;). 4) \"Run a SELECT on X.Y where ...\" (provide conditions). 5) \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (provide exact changes). Once you tell me the precise question I will: (a) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and (b) either perform a single SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation plus a one-line SQL code block) or provide a final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed.",
