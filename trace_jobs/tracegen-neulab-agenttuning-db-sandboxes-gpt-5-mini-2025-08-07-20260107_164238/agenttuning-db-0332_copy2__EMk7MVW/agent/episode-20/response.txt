  "analysis": "You're in a container where MySQL client and server are installed and running. The mysqld process is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, database name, or table name has been provided, so no further SQL has been executed this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want done with the database. Once you provide the precise question or action, I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant; 2) choose whether to Operate or Answer; if I Operate I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) and you will execute only that SQL and return the output. Examples of valid requests you can give right now:\n- \"List databases\" (I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database mysql\" (I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;)\n- \"Describe table mysql.user\" (I'll run: DESCRIBE mysql.user;)\n- \"SELECT column1,column2 FROM mydb.mytable WHERE condition\" (give the table and condition)\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (give the exact DML to apply)\n\nIf you want schema discovery first but don't specify a database, I will default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; unless you tell me otherwise. Tell me which of the above (or your specific question) to proceed with.",
