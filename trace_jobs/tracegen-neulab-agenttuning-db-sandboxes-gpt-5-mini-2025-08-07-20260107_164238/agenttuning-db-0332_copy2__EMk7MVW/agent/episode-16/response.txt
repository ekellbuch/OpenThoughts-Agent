  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A test query returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, database name, or table name has been provided, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request:\n- \"List databases\" (I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database X\" (I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM X;)\n- \"Describe table X.Y\" (I'll run: DESCRIBE X.Y;)\n- \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\" (provide the condition and columns to return)\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (provide exact changes)\n\nWhen you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide a final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed.",
