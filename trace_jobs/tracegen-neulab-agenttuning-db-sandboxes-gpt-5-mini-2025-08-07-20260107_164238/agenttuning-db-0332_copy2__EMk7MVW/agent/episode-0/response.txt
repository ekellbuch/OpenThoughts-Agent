There is no prior command output to indicate whether a MySQL server is available or what credentials to use. I haven't been asked a specific database question yet. Next steps should detect whether the mysql client exists and attempt to connect (list databases) so we can see available schemas and proceed once you provide the specific question.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client is installed (mysql --version). 2) If available, attempt to connect as root and list databases (mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"). This will show whether a server is reachable and which databases exist so I can ask you for the specific question or proceed to run further SQL as you instruct.",
