  "analysis": "Current state: inside the container MySQL client and server are installed and running. The mysqld process is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and is usable, and the mysql client can connect as root without a password (server was initialized insecurely). A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user question, target database or table name has been provided, so no further SQL work has been done. What has been accomplished: installed mysql client/server, started mysqld, verified connectivity and listed system databases. What still needs to be done: you must tell me the exact database question or action you want (for example: list tables in a specific database, describe a table, run a SELECT with certain conditions, or perform DML/DDL).",
  "plan": "I will not run any more shell commands until you specify your database question. When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant and outline the approach. 2) Choose between: (a) Operation — provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) to be executed (this will be the only SQL block you should run), or (b) Answer — if no operation is required, provide the final answer in the exact format you requested. If schema discovery is needed first I will request or run a single SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; or DESCRIBE <db>.<table>; statement (one SQL statement per round). Examples of valid next requests from you: \"List databases\", \"List tables in database mysql\", \"Describe mysql.user\", \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable WHERE ...\", or provide an exact DML/DDL to apply. Note: root currently has an empty password (insecure); avoid exposing this server externally.",
