  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are now installed and running in the container. The server process is running (mysqld via mysqld_safe), the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and is usable, and the mysql client can connect as root without a password (the server was initialized with --initialize-insecure). A test query returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The server error log shows normal initialization messages and that the server is ready for connections. Note: root currently has an empty password (insecure) and this environment is ephemeral; avoid exposing this to untrusted networks.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered (which table(s), conditions, or aggregation you need). When you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the problem and my approach, including any assumptions about table/column names. 2) Decide whether to \"Operate\" (run a SQL statement) or give a final \"Answer.\" If I choose to operate I will include exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single SQL code block in markdown, one line). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its output; I'll then interpret the output and continue iterating until we're done. If I choose to finish, I will provide: Action: Answer Final Answer: [\"...\"].\n\nBefore running any user-requested SQL, I can also inspect schema details (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM db; or DESCRIBE db.table;) if needed — each will be issued as a single SQL statement per your rules. Tell me the question you want answered or which database/table you'd like me to inspect.",
