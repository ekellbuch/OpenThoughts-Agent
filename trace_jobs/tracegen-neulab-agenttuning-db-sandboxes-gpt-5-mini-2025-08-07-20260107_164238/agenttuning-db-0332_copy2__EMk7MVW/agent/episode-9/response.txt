  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root without a password (server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There is currently no user question or target database/table specified, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or action you want (examples: \"List databases\", \"Show tables in database X\", \"Describe table X.Y\", \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\", or a DML/DDL change). After you provide the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and any assumptions about database/table/column names. 2) Choose to either perform one SQL operation (I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want schema discovery first, tell me which database to inspect (or say \"show me databases/tables\") and I'll issue the appropriate single SQL statement in the next message.",
