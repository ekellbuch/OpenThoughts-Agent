The mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, target database, or table name has been provided, so no further SQL operations are appropriate yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples of valid requests:\n- \"List databases\" (I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database X\" (I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM X;)\n- \"Describe table X.Y\" (I'll run: DESCRIBE X.Y;)\n- \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\" (give the condition and columns)\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" (give exact changes)\n\nWhen you state the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide a final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want schema discovery first, say which database to inspect (or ask me to run SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;) and I will operate accordingly.",
