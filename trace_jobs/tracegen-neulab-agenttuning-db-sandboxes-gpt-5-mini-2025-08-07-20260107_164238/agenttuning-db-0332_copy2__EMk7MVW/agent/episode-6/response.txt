  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The server process (mysqld) is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There is currently no specific database question from you to act on.",
  "plan": "Please tell me the exact database question you want answered (examples: list tables in a database, describe a specific table, run a SELECT with conditions/aggregations, or modify data). Once you state the question I will: 1) Explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant. 2) Choose to either perform an operation or give a final answer. If I perform an operation, I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its output; I'll then interpret that output and continue until the task is complete. If you want me to inspect schema first, tell me which database (or I can start with SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;) — I will issue one SQL statement per round as required.",
