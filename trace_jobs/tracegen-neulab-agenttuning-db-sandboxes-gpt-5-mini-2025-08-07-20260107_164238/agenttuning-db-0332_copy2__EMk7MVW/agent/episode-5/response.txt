  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The server process (mysqld) is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root without a password (server was initialized insecurely). A test query returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no outstanding terminal operations to run right now.",
  "plan": "I'm ready to answer your database question. Please tell me what you want (examples: list databases, list tables in a specific database, describe a table, run a SELECT with conditions/aggregations, or modify data). Once you state the question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding and assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant. 2) Choose to either operate (run one SQL statement) or give a final answer. If I operate, I will provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) in a single-line code block; you will execute only that first SQL block and return the output. If more exploration is needed (e.g., to discover table names or schema), I may first issue SHOW TABLES or DESCRIBE statements — each will be a single SQL statement per round. Note: root currently has an empty password (insecure); avoid exposing the server externally.",
