The server (mysqld) is running, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client connects as root with an empty password. A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No specific database question, database name, or table name has been provided by you yet, so no further SQL has been executed this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;\n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" — provide the columns and conditions;\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" — provide the exact DML to apply.\n\nWhen you provide the exact question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about the schema and approach, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will supply exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or give a final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. If you want schema discovery but don't specify a database, say so or I will default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;.",
