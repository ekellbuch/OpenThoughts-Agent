The mysqld process is active and listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, target database, or table name has been provided by you, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do with the database. Give one of the following (or equivalent):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run SHOW DATABASES; \n- \"List tables in database X\" — I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM X; \n- \"Describe table X.Y\" — I'll run DESCRIBE X.Y; \n- \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\" — provide the condition and the columns to return\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in X.Y\" — provide the exact changes\n\nAfter you state the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant; 2) choose to either Operate (run exactly one SQL statement and present it in the required format) or Answer (provide the final answer). If you want me to start schema discovery but don't specify a database, I will default to SHOW TABLES FROM mysql; unless you tell me otherwise.",
