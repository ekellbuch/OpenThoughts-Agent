  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. mysqld is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, and the mysql client can connect as root without a password. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). Currently you have not provided a specific database question, database name, or table name to operate on, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to state the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples: \"List databases\" (I'll run SHOW DATABASES;), \"List tables in database X\" (I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM X;), \"Describe table X.Y\" (I'll run DESCRIBE X.Y;), \"SELECT rows from X.Y where ...\" (provide conditions), or a DML/DDL change (provide exact change). Once you give the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format) or provide a final answer if no operation is needed.",
