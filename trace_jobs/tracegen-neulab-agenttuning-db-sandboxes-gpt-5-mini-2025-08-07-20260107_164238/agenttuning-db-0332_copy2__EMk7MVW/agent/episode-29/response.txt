  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. The mysqld process is active and listening on /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (the server was initialized insecurely). A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No specific database question, database name, or table name has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or action you want me to perform. Examples you can request (pick one or provide your own):\n- \"List databases\" — I'll run: SHOW DATABASES;\n- \"List tables in database <db>\" — I'll run: SHOW TABLES FROM <db>;\n- \"Describe table <db>.<table>\" — I'll run: DESCRIBE <db>.<table>;\n- \"SELECT columns FROM <db>.<table> WHERE ...\" — provide the columns and condition; I'll explain assumptions then run one SQL statement;\n- \"Insert/update/delete rows in <db>.<table>\" — provide the exact DML to apply.\n\nWhen you give the exact question I will: 1) explain my understanding and any assumptions about which database/table/columns are relevant, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block) or provide the final answer (Action: Answer Final Answer: [...]) if no operation is needed. Note: root currently has an empty password; the server is local and insecure—avoid exposing it externally.",
