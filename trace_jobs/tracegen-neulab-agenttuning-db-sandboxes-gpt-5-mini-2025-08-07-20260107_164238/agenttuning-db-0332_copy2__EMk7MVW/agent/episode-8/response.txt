  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. The server process (mysqld) is active, the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and the mysql client can connect as root with an empty password (the server was initialized insecurely). A previous SHOW DATABASES returned the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There is currently no specific database question or target database/table specified by you, so I have nothing further to run.",
  "plan": "I need you to state exactly what you want me to do with the database. Examples of valid requests:\n- \"List databases\" (I'll run SHOW DATABASES;)\n- \"List tables in database X\" (I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM X;)\n- \"Describe table X.Y\" (I'll run DESCRIBE X.Y;)\n- \"Run a SELECT to find rows where ...\" (I'll explain assumptions and then run the SELECT)\n- \"Insert/update/delete data in X.Y\" (state the exact change)\n\nOnce you tell me the precise question or the database/table to inspect, I will: 1) explain my understanding and assumptions, and 2) either perform one SQL operation (I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format) or give the final answer if no operation is needed. Note: root currently has no password; the server is local and should be treated as insecure.",
