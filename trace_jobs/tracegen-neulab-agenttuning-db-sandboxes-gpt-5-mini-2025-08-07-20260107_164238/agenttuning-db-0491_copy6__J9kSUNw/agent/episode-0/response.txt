To proceed I need to detect whether a MySQL client is available, whether a MySQL server process is running, and then try a simple connection (e.g., as root without a password) to list databases. Once I can query the server, I'll follow your workflow for SQL operations.",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary exists. 2) Print the mysql client version if present. 3) Check whether a MySQL server process (mysqld) is running. 4) Try a basic connection and list databases using the mysql client as root (no password). If that connection fails due to authentication or missing server, you'll provide credentials or indicate how to proceed. Each command is chosen to gather info needed before running any SQL statements.",
