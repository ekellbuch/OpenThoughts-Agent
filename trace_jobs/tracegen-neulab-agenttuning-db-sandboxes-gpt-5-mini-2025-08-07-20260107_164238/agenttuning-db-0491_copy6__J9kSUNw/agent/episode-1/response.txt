  "analysis": "The container currently has no mysql client installed: 'which mysql' returned nothing and 'mysql --version' failed with 'command not found'. There is no mysqld process running (ps output empty). A direct attempt to run 'mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"' failed because the client is missing. To be able to run SQL against a MySQL server we need a MySQL client binary installed in this environment and a reachable MySQL server (either local or remote) with credentials. Right now we only have a shell; we don't yet know if a server exists elsewhere or what credentials to use.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) so we can run mysql commands from this container. 2) Verify the client is installed and get its version. 3) Attempt to connect to a server as root without a password to list databases (SHOW DATABASES). If that fails due to auth or no server, report back and request connection details (host, port, user, password) or instructions to start a local server. Commands that modify the system (apt-get) will be run first; then we'll run the mysql client to attempt the SQL query.",
