  "analysis": "This container is minimal and currently has no MySQL client or server. We verified apt-get/apt are present, while mysql binary, mysqld process, and networking tools are missing. To run SQL against a MySQL server from this container we first need to install a MySQL client. After installing the client we'll verify its presence and then you can provide the SQL question to execute (or a remote server to connect to).",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install the default MySQL client package (noninteractive). 3) Verify the mysql client is installed by checking which binary and printing its version. I expect apt-get update to fetch package metadata, apt-get install to install the client (providing the 'mysql' CLI), and the subsequent checks to show the path and version of the mysql client.",
