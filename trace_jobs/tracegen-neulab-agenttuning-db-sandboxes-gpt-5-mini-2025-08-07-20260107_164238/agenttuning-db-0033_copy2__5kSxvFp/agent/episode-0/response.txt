  "analysis": "We currently have an interactive shell at root@ee3580acfba1:/app with no prior commands executed in this session (the prompt is visible). There's no visible MySQL activity yet. To answer SQL questions I need to locate a MySQL server or a database file and a client to run queries. Nothing has been done to inspect the filesystem or processes yet.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current directory and common locations for database files or project files (/app). 2) Check whether a mysql client is available and its version. 3) Look for a running MySQL/MariaDB server process and socket files. 4) Check listening TCP ports for MySQL (default 3306). Based on these results I'll report back and, if the server/client are available, proceed to connect and run SQL as you request. The commands will: list files in /app, list root directory, check for mysql client, print its version, look for mysqld process, check /var/run and /var/run/mysqld, and show listening TCP sockets.",
