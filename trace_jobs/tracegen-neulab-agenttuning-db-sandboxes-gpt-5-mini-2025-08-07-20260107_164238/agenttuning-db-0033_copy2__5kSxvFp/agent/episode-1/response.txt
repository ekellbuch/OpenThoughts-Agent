  "analysis": "Current environment is a minimal container at /app with no MySQL client or server installed. Commands already run show: mysql binary not found, no mysqld processes, /var/run/mysqld absent, and ss utility missing. The filesystem in /app is empty. To be able to run SQL against a MySQL server from this container we need a MySQL client (or a server) installed or access to a remote MySQL instance. Right now nothing has been installed or started.",
  "plan": "First detect which package manager is available so we can install a MySQL client. I will check for apt-get, apt, apk (Alpine), and yum. After you provide the outputs of those checks I will choose the appropriate install command (for example: DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y default-mysql-client or apk add mariadb-client). If installation succeeds, we'll verify the mysql client is present with mysql --version and then proceed to connect/run the SQL you request. For now I'll only probe for package managers so we can decide the correct install command next.",
