In short: ready to run SQL but missing connection info and the query goal.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the database connection details (host, optional port, username, password, and database name) and the specific question you want answered (e.g., which table/columns/conditions). If you want me to try connecting to localhost without credentials, say 'attempt localhost' and I will try a connection. Once you provide details and the question, I will (1) produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a one-line SQL code block) and (2) you will execute it and return the raw MySQL output to me. After receiving the output I will analyze it and either run another operation or produce the final answer using the required Action: Answer format.",
