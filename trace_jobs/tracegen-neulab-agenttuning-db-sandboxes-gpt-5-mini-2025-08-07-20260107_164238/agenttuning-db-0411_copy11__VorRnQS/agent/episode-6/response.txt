No SQL has been executed because I don't have any connection details (host/port/user/password/database) nor a specific SQL question from you. I'm ready to run SQL once you provide connection info and the question you want answered.",

Alternatively, if you want me to attempt a default local connection (which will likely fail if no server is running or credentials are required), say 'attempt localhost' and I will try connecting as root without a password. Once you supply details or permit a default attempt, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute; then you will return the raw MySQL output and I will continue.",
