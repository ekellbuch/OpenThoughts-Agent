If you pick A, provide: host, port (if not 3306), user, password, database, and the exact SQL question to answer; I will then produce one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL block) for you to execute. If you pick B, reply with 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally include a root password and any initial DB/user to create; with that explicit authorization I will install and start the chosen server and then run SQL locally.
