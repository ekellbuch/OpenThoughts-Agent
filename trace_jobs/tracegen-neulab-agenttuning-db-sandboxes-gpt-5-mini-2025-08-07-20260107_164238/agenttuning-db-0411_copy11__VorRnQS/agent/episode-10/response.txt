  "analysis": "We have a working mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). So far there is no MySQL server process detected and no environment variables or files in /app that provide DB credentials. You haven't given any connection details or the SQL question you want answered. Before asking you again for credentials, it's useful to check the system for any local MySQL server artifacts (socket, data dir, config, listening port) so we can determine whether a local server exists to connect to without network credentials. Nothing has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "1) Look for a MySQL socket and server files: check /var/run/mysqld, /var/lib/mysql, and /etc/mysql for presence of sockets, data, or configuration. 2) Check if any process is listening on port 3306 (mysqld default). 3) Re-prompt you for DB connection details if no local server is found. These checks don't require credentials and will tell us whether attempting a localhost connection is worthwhile.",
