Option A: provide remote DB details (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database) and the exact SQL question you want answered. I will then produce a single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. Option B: authorize installing a local server by replying 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally provide a root password and any initial DB/user to create; with that explicit authorization I will install/start the server and then run SQL locally.
