Once you provide that I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute; after you run it and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze and continue.\n- Option B (create a local DB in this container): reply with 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally specify a root password and any initial DB/user to create. With your permission I will install and start the server, then run SQL locally. I will not install or start a server without explicit confirmation.\nFor now I will re-prompt you to pick one of these options and provide any needed details.",
