Please provide the database connection details (host, optional port if not 3306, username, password, and database name) and the exact question you want answered from the database. Alternatively, if you want me to try a default local connection (which may fail if no server or credentials), reply with 'attempt localhost' and I will run a connection attempt to localhost as the next step. Once you provide details or allow the default attempt, I will produce a single SQL statement (Action: Operation and one-line SQL block) for you to execute, then analyze the returned output and continue as needed.",
