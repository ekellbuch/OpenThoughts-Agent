B) Authorize installing a local server by replying 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally provide a root password and any initial DB/user to create — with explicit permission I'll install and start the chosen server and then run SQL locally. I will not install or start any server without your explicit authorization.",
