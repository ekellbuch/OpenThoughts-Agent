Once provided I'll produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL block) for you to execute. (B) If you want a local database in this container, reply with 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally include a root password and any initial DB/user to create; with that explicit authorization I will install and start the chosen server and then run SQL locally. I will not install or start a server without your explicit permission.",
