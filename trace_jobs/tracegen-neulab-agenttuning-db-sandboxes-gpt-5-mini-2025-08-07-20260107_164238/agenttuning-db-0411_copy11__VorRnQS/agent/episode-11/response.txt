  "analysis": "Summary of current state: the mysql client is installed (mysql 8.0.44). I checked for a local server and artifacts: /var/run/mysqld and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, /etc/mysql exists (contains my.cnf and conf.d), no mysqld processes are running, and the ss utility is not present to check listening sockets. In short: there is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running in this container, and you have not provided any remote DB connection details (host/port/user/password/database). No SQL has been executed against any database yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Two safe options:\n- Option 1 (preferred if you have an existing DB): provide remote database connection details (host, optional port, username, password, database name). I will then craft one SQL statement at a time in the exact format you specified for you to execute and return the MySQL output.\n- Option 2 (if you want a local DB inside this container): I can install and start a local MySQL-compatible server (default-mysql-server or mariadb-server), create or initialize a database/user as needed, and then run SQL locally. This requires explicit permission because installing and starting a server will modify the environment. If you pick Option 2, tell me which server to install (default-mysql-server or mariadb-server) and any desired root password or DB/user names; otherwise I can proceed with defaults.\nI will not attempt to start or install a server without your confirmation. Please reply with either your DB connection details or the choice to install/start a local server and any configuration you want.",
