There's no information about a MySQL server, client, or database credentials available in the current terminal output. To help you operate a MySQL database and run SQL, I first need to discover whether a MySQL server or client is available in this environment and where the database files, sockets, or credentials might be. After locating the server/client and any credentials or socket, I can connect and run the SQL you request. Right now nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to MySQL.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see project files that might contain DB info (e.g., .env, docker-compose.yml). 2) Check the MySQL client version to see if the mysql client is installed. 3) Check running processes for a MySQL/MariaDB server to see if a local server is running. 4) Print environment variables that mention mysql to find possible credentials (e.g., MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST). These steps will help identify how to connect and what SQL to run next.",
