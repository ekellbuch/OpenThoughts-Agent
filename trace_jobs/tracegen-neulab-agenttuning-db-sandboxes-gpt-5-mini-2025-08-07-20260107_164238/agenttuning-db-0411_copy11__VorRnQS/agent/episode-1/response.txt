No MySQL/MariaDB server processes are running and there are no environment variables mentioning MySQL. Nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to a database yet. To run SQL I need a MySQL client present or a way to connect; the next step is to install a MySQL-compatible client so we can connect to a database once you provide host/user/password or socket information.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) so the mysql command is available. 3) Verify the installation by running mysql --version. After that I'll ask you for the database host, user, and password (or socket and database name) so I can craft the SQL to run. If you prefer a different client (mariadb-client) tell me and I'll install that instead.",
