  "analysis": "Summary: The mysql client is installed and working (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running in this container (no /var/run/mysqld or /var/lib/mysql and no mysqld process). There are no environment variables or files under /app providing DB credentials. No SQL has been executed because you have not provided remote DB connection details and you have not authorized installing a local server. I cannot connect to or modify any database until you either supply remote connection details or explicitly allow a local server installation.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose exactly one option. Please reply with one of the following:\n\nOption A (connect to an existing database): provide host, port (if not 3306), username, password, database name, and the exact SQL question you want answered. After you provide those I will produce one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B (create a local database in this container): explicitly authorize installation by replying with either 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server'. Optionally include a desired root password and any initial database/user to create. If you authorize this, I will install and start the chosen server and then run SQL locally.\n\nI will not install or start any server without explicit authorization. Please reply with exactly one of the above options and include any required details.",
