There is no local MySQL server detected (previous ps showed none), and there are no environment variables with MySQL credentials. At this point the system can run MySQL client commands, but I do not have the host, username, password, or database name needed to connect to any database and run SQL. Nothing has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will (1) confirm the mysql client is available (already done) and (2) ask you to provide the connection details (host, port if nonstandard, username, password or indication of socket and database name). Once you provide those, I will craft a single SQL statement per your request in the exact format you specified. If you want me to attempt a default connection (e.g., to localhost as root without password), say so; otherwise provide credentials. After receiving credentials I will run one SQL statement at a time and explain results as requested.",
