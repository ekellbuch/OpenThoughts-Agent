Provide two explicit options: (A) give remote DB connection details (host, optional port, user, password, database) plus the exact SQL question to answer, or (B) authorize installation of a local server by replying with 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and any desired root password / initial DB/user info. I will not install or start any server unless you explicitly choose option B. After you reply with your choice and any required details, I will perform the next concrete action (connect and run one SQL statement, or install/start a server and then run SQL).",
