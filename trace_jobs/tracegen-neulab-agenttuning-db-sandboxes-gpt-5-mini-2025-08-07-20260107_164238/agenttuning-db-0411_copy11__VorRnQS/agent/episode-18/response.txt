No SQL has been executed against any database in this session. I cannot run any SQL until you either (A) provide remote DB connection details (host, port if not 3306, user, password, database) and the exact SQL question to answer, or (B) explicitly instruct me to install and start a local server (reply with 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally provide a root password and any initial DB/user to create).",

Once provided I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL code block) for you to execute and then analyze the returned MySQL output.\n- Option B (create a local DB in this container): you must explicitly authorize installation by replying 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' and optionally give a root password and any initial DB/user names. With that permission I will install and start the chosen server and proceed to run SQL locally. I will not install or start a server without explicit authorization.\nI will not take any other actions until you choose one of these options and provide the needed information.",
