After you provide those, I will produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a one-line SQL block) for you to execute. 2) Option B — Reply with 'install local default-mysql-server' or 'install local mariadb-server' to authorize installation of a local server, and optionally provide a root password and any initial DB/user to create; after that I will install/start the server and run SQL locally. I will not install or start a server without your explicit authorization. I will wait for your choice.",
