Option A (connect to an existing remote DB): you provide host, port (if not 3306), user, password, and database name plus the SQL question to answer; I will then produce a single SQL statement in the exact format you requested for you to execute. Option B (create a local DB in this container): you authorize installation and specify which server you prefer (default-mysql-server or mariadb-server) and any desired root password / initial DB/user names; I'll then install and start the server and run SQL locally. I will not install or start a server without explicit confirmation. Next command will re-prompt you for which option you choose and any details needed.",
