To run SQL I need connection details for a MySQL server (host, port, user, password, and database name) or instructions to install and initialize a local server. Nothing has been executed against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and the database connection details. Please tell me the SQL question you want answered and provide connection info (host, port, user, password, database). Once you provide those, I will: 1) attempt to connect using the mysql client (I will show the exact mysql command I intend to run), 2) run a single SQL statement per your instructions (I will place the SQL in a single-line markdown code block as required), and 3) interpret the returned output and iterate until the final answer is ready. If you want a local server instead, tell me and I will install and initialize one.",
