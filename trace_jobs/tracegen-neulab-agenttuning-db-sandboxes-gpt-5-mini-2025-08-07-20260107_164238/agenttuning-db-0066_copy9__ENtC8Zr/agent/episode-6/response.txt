  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration present. No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host/port/user/password/database). The environment is ready to run mysql client commands once I have connection info or after a local server is installed and initialized.",
  "plan": "I will not execute any SQL until you choose how to proceed. Pick one of the following options and provide the requested details: \n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), and database name, and the exact question you need answered (what to find or compute). \n- I will then show the exact mysql client command I'll use to connect and produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a one-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output; I'll parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- If you want a local server, confirm and provide desired root password (or indicate to use --initialize-insecure), and optionally a user/database name and password to create. \n- I will: install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create the requested database/user, show the mysql client command I'll use, and then produce a single SQL statement for you to execute. \n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already have run queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer.\n\nNotes about operation format: when ready to run SQL I will output exactly the required pattern: first a line 'Action: Operation' and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown code block. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and provide its raw output. After we finish operations, I will commit the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' / 'Final Answer: [...]' pattern if I am certain of the result.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the necessary connection or configuration details and the question to answer.",
