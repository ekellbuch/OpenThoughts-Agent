  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration present (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor asked me to install/initialize a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection details or instructions to install and initialize a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not perform any further changes without your explicit choice. Please choose one of the following options and provide the requested details so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question you want answered (what to find or compute). After you provide these I will show the exact mysql client command I'll use and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output; I'll parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or indicate to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and a user/password to create. If you confirm, I will run the installation and initialization steps, start the server, create the requested database/user, show the mysql client command to connect, and then output the first SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute. Note: installing and starting a server in a container may take extra time.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output along with the question; I will parse it and answer directly.\n\nIf you choose Option A, supply the connection details and the question. If you choose Option B, confirm installation and give the desired credentials and DB name. Once you respond I will proceed and provide the exact next command or the single SQL statement (per your operation rules).",
