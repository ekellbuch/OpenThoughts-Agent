  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration detected (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or asked to install a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection details or instructions to set up a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please choose one of these options and provide the required details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question you want answered. I will then: (1) show the exact mysql client command I'll use to connect, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and user/password to create. If confirmed, I will: install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create the requested database/user, show the mysql client command I'll use, and then produce a single SQL statement for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer.\n\nWhen you choose, also provide the SQL question you want answered. If you choose Option A or B, I will follow the required operation format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for the first SQL to execute. If you confirm Option B (install local server), I will run the necessary install/start commands and then present the connection and first SQL.",
