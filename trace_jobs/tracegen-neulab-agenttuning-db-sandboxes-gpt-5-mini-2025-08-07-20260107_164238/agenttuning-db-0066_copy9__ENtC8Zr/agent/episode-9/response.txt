  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration present (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host/port/user/password/database) or requested a local server to be installed. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection details or instructions to install and initialize a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide the required details so I can continue:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question you want answered (what to find or compute). After you provide these I will show the exact mysql client command I'll use and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and user/password to create. If confirmed, I will install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create the requested database/user, then present the mysql client command and a single SQL statement for you to run.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer.\n\nWhen you provide the connection details and the question, I will either (1) produce the exact mysql client command I will run to connect, followed by a single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute, or (2) perform the local server installation steps if you chose Option B. I will not run any SQL until you provide one of these options and the necessary details.",
