  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44) but there is no MySQL server running locally and no database files/config present. No SQL has been executed because I haven't been given a question or any database connection details (host/port/user/password/database). The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I have connection info or after a local server is installed and initialized.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Please choose one of the following options and provide any necessary details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended if you already have a DB):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or state no password / socket auth), and database name. Also give the SQL question you want answered. I will then show the exact mysql client command I will use and produce a single SQL statement in the required format for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container (if you want the DB created here):\n- Confirm you want me to install a local server. If yes, I will:\n  1) Install mysql-server (or mariadb-server if you prefer).\n  2) Initialize the data directory (using --initialize-insecure if needed) and start the server manually.\n  3) Create a database and user (with a password you provide) so we can run queries.\n  4) Then I will present the mysql command and a single SQL statement for you to run.\n\nOption C — You will paste raw MySQL output for me to parse:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse and answer.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required details (or say install local server and provide desired root/user passwords and DB name). Once you do, I will proceed and issue the exact commands or the single SQL statement following the operation rules you specified.",
