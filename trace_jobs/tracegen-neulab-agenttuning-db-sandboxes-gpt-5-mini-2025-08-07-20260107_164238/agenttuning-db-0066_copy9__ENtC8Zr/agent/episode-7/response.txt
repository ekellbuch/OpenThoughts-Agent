  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and there are no database files or configs detected (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL has been executed because you haven't provided a question or any database connection details. The environment is ready to run mysql client commands but I cannot query a database until you either (A) give connection details for an existing server, or (B) instruct me to install and initialize a local server here, or (C) paste raw MySQL output you want me to parse.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose one of these options and provide the required details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database:\n- Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question to answer. After you provide these I'll show the exact mysql client command I'll use and then produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation + one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will paste back the raw MySQL output and I'll parse/iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and user/password to create. If you confirm, I will run the commands to install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create the database/user, and then present the mysql client command and the single SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute. This requires additional installation time.\n\nOption C — Provide raw MySQL output:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer directly.\n\nTell me which option you choose and include the necessary details (connection info or installation choice and credentials) and the SQL question you want answered. I will then produce the exact next command(s) or the single SQL statement as required.",
