  "analysis": "The container currently has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no MySQL data/configuration found on standard paths (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql). No SQL statements have been executed in this session because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor requested installation/initialization of a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection info or instructions to install and initialize a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the options below and provide the requested details (and the exact SQL question you want answered):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password/socket auth), and database name, plus the exact question to answer. After you provide these I will show the exact mysql client command I'll use and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and a user/password to create. If you confirm, I will: install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create the requested database/user, and then present the mysql client command and the first SQL statement in the required format for you to run.\n\nOption C — Provide raw MySQL output (if you already ran queries elsewhere):\n- Paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer directly.\n\nWhen you choose Option A or B, also include the exact SQL question you want answered. I will then output the next operation in the exact format you specified (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL in a markdown code block).",
