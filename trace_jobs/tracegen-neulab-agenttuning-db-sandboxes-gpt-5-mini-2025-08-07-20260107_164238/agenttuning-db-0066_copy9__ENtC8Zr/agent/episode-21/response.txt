  "analysis": "The mysql-server installation is in progress / recently ran (the apt output shows many packages installed and post-install steps invoking mysql client). We started installing a local MySQL server and attempted to create a database 'example_db' and user 'appuser' with password 'password' (those CREATE statements were in the earlier planned commands). The apt output includes echoed mysql client invocations, but installation output was truncated (mecab dictionary compilation messages visible) so we need to confirm the server is running and that the user/database were created successfully. What has been accomplished: mysql-server package installation has progressed and the mysql client is available. What still needs to be done: verify mysqld is running, confirm the mysql.user records (and plugin), confirm example_db exists and that appuser can connect and see tables (none expected yet).",
  "plan": "1) Check for a running MySQL server process (ps). 2) Check whether port 3306 is listening (ss/netstat). 3) As root, query mysql.user to confirm created users and authentication plugin. 4) Try connecting as appuser to example_db and show tables to verify access. 5) List /var/lib/mysql to confirm data directory exists. These commands will validate the server state and the result of the post-install SQL. If any step fails, we'll proceed to start the server or adjust credentials as needed.",
