  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no MySQL data/configuration files detected (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL statements have been executed in this session because you have not provided a database question or connection details, nor requested a local server installation. The environment is ready to run mysql client commands once you provide connection info or ask me to install and initialize a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL or make changes until you tell me how to proceed. Choose one of these options and provide the required details (and the SQL question you want answered):\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database:\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question to answer (what to find or compute). After you provide these I will: (1) show the exact mysql client command I'll use to connect for you to confirm, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will paste the raw MySQL output back and I'll parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide a desired root password (or indicate to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and a user/password to create. If confirmed, I will: install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create the requested database/user, show the mysql client connection command, and then produce a single SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Provide raw MySQL output:\n- If you already have run queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer directly.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details plus the SQL question. Once you do, I will proceed and output the exact operation SQL statement (one statement) per your rules.",
