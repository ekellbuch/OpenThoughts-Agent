  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration found (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host/port/user/password/database) nor asked me to install a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection details or instructions to install/initialize a local server.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of these options and provide the necessary details:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question you want answered. I will then: (1) show the exact mysql client command I'll use, and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format (a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block) for you to execute. You will run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output for me to parse and iterate.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and user/password to create. If confirmed, I will: install mysql-server, initialize/start it, create the requested database/user, present the mysql client command, and then produce a single SQL statement for you to run.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already executed queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer.\n\nWhen you provide your choice and the required details (connection info or installation confirmation plus the SQL question), I will proceed and output the exact operation SQL statement per your rules.",
