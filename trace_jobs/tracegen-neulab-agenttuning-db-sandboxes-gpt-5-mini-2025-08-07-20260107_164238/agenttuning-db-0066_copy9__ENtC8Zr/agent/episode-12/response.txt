  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration detected (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL has been executed because you haven't provided a question or any database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor asked me to install and initialize a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection details or instructions to set up a local server.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of the options below and provide the requested details and the SQL question you want answered.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question (what to find or compute). I will then show the exact mysql client command I'll use to connect and produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output back; I'll parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and user/password to create. If confirmed, I will install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create the requested database/user, then present the mysql client command and produce the first SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you've already run queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer directly.\n\nWhen you choose, include the SQL question you want answered. After you provide the connection/installation choice and details, I'll proceed and output the exact operation SQL (one statement) per your rules.",
