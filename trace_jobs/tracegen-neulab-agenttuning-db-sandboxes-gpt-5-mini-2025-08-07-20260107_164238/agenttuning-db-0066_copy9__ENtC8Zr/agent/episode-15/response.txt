  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files or configuration detected (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL statements have been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) nor asked to install and initialize a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once I receive connection details or instructions to set up a local server.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one option and provide the required details and the exact SQL question you want answered:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password/socket auth), database name, and the question (what to find or compute).\n- I will show the exact mysql client command I'll use to connect (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -pPASSWORD DATABASE) and then produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will run that SQL and paste the raw MySQL output; I will parse it and iterate until we reach the final answer.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide desired root password (or say to initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name and a user/password to create.\n- I will install mysql-server, initialize and start it, create the requested database/user, then present the mysql client command and the first SQL (Action: Operation) for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer directly.\n\nWhen you choose, also provide the exact SQL question to answer. After you provide the option and details, I will either (A) present the connection command and a single SQL statement (Action: Operation) or (B) perform the local server installation steps and then present the first SQL. I will wait for your choice and details.",
