  "analysis": "Right now the container has the mysql client installed but there is no MySQL server running and no database files/config present. You haven't provided connection details for an external DB, and you haven't chosen whether to set up a local server. To proceed and be able to run SQL here, we should install and initialize a local MySQL server and create a database and user that we can query from the mysql client. As root in this container we can install the mysql-server package, start the server, and create a database and user. After that I'll be able to run SQL (following your rule about providing a single SQL statement per operation).",
  "plan": "1) Install mysql-server package so a local server is available. 2) Start the MySQL service (or the server process) so it listens for connections. 3) Create a database and a dedicated user with a known password so we can connect and run SQL as that user. 4) Verify the server is running and the created user/database exist. After these steps I will present the exact mysql client command I will use and then produce a single SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute. Expected outcomes: a running local MySQL server, a database named example_db, and a user appuser with password 'password' (you can later change these if you want).",
