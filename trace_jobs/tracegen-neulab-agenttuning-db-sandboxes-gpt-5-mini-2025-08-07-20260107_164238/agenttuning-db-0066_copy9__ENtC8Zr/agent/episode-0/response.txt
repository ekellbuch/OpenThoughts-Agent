  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app. No commands have been run yet in this session (prompt shows an idle shell). There is no information yet about a MySQL server, client, or database files. Before issuing any SQL, I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, whether the mysql client is available, and where database files/configuration live so I can connect and run queries. Nothing has been accomplished toward answering a SQL question yet.",
  "plan": "I will inspect the current working directory and list files, then check whether the mysql client is available and its version. Next I'll look for a running MySQL process and examine common MySQL data/config locations (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql). Finally I'll search the top-level filesystem (shallow search) for .cnf files to locate any configuration that might indicate connection parameters. These steps will let me decide how to connect and then run SQL when you provide the question. Expected results: determine if mysql client exists, whether a mysqld process is running, and where DB files/config are located.",
