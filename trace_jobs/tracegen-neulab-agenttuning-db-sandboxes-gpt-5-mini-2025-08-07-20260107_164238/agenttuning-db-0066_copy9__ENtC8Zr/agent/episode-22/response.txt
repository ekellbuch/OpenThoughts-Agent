  "analysis": "The mysql-server installation completed and the package post-install scripts indicated mysqld is running as pid 1544. However, we still need to verify that the server is listening on 3306, confirm the mysql.user entries (including plugin/auth method) to ensure the created 'appuser' exists and can authenticate, and verify that example_db exists and that appuser can connect and see tables (none expected yet). We'll also list /var/lib/mysql to confirm the data directory is present.",
  "plan": "1) Check for the mysqld process to confirm it's running. 2) Check whether port 3306 is listening (ss). 3) Query mysql.user as root to list users and authentication plugin. 4) Try connecting as appuser to example_db and run SHOW TABLES to verify access. 5) List /var/lib/mysql to confirm the data directory and contents. If any step fails we'll adjust (start server or recreate user).",
