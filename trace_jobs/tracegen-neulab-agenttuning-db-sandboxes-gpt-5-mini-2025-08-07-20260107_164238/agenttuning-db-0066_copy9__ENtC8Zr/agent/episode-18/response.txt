  "analysis": "You have a container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no MySQL data/configuration found (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host, port, username, password, database) nor asked to install a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once you supply connection info or request a local server install and initialization.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Please pick one of the options below and provide the requested details (and the exact SQL question you want answered). After you respond I will either (A) show the exact mysql client command I'll use and produce a single SQL statement in the required 'Action: Operation' format for you to execute, or (B) install and initialize a local MySQL server and then present the connection command and first SQL statement.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing database (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate no password / socket auth), database name, and the exact question to answer.\n- I will then present the mysql client command I'll use (for you to confirm) and output exactly one SQL statement in the required format.\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want this and provide: desired root password (or say initialize insecurely), and optionally a database name plus a user and password to create.\n- If confirmed, I will run the installation and initialization steps, start the server, create the requested database/user, then present the mysql client connection command and the first SQL statement (Action: Operation) for you to execute.\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer.\n\nWhen you choose, also include the exact SQL question you want answered. Reminder of required operation format: when I present SQL to be executed it will be exactly in the form:\nAction: Operation\n```sql\nSELECT ...;\n```\n(with a single SQL statement on one line). After you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output I will parse it and continue until we can commit the final answer with the exact 'Action: Answer' / 'Final Answer: [...]' pattern.",
