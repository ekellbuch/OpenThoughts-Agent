  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no MySQL data/config detected (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql are absent). No SQL has been executed because you have not provided a question or any database connection details (host/port/user/password/database) nor asked to install & initialize a local server. The environment is ready to run the mysql client once you provide connection details or request a local server be set up.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed. Pick one of these options and provide the required details (and the SQL question to answer). After you choose, I will produce the exact single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) to execute, and then parse the raw MySQL output you return.\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended):\n- Provide: host (or socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate empty), database name, and the exact question you want answered (what to find or compute).\n- Example mysql client commands I would use (you can confirm which one to run):\n  - TCP: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE\n  - Socket: mysql --socket=/path/to/mysql.sock -u USER -p'PASSWORD' DATABASE\n(Do not include these examples as SQL; they are the client connection commands.)\n\nOption B — Install and initialize a local MySQL server in this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server and provide a root password (or say to initialize insecurely) and optionally a database name and user/password to create.\n- If you request this, I will: install the server, initialize/start it, create the database/user, then present the mysql client command and the first SQL statement for you to execute. Example installation commands I would run (only after you confirm):\n  - apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  - systemctl start mysql  (or use mysqld_safe / service mysql start in container)\n  - mysql -uroot -p'ROOTPASS' -e \"CREATE DATABASE dbname; CREATE USER 'u'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass'; GRANT ALL ON dbname.* TO 'u'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\"\n\nOption C — Paste raw MySQL output you already have:\n- If you already ran queries elsewhere, paste the raw MySQL output and the question; I will parse it and answer.\n\nWhen you choose Option A or C, also supply the precise SQL question you want answered. I will then output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block). You will execute the SQL (only the SQL in the first code block) and paste the raw MySQL output back; I will parse it and continue until we can commit the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' / 'Final Answer: [...]' pattern you specified.",
