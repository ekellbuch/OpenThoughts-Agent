  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (mysql 8.0.44). There is no MySQL server running locally and no database files/config found, so I cannot run any SQL yet. Nothing has been executed against a database in this session.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide the question you want answered and the database connection details so I can run SQL and retrieve results. Please provide: host (or socket), port (if not default 3306), username, password (or tell me to connect without a password), and the database name. Alternatively, tell me if you want me to install and initialize a local MySQL server instead. Once you provide the connection info and the question, I will: 1) show the mysql client command I will use to connect; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute; 3) interpret the output you return and iterate until we can produce the final answer. If you prefer, you can also paste the raw MySQL output directly and I will parse it.",
