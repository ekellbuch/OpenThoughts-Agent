  "analysis": "The previous diagnostics show there is no mysql client installed (which mysql returned nothing and 'mysql --version' failed). There is also no mysqld/mariadb server process running, and common MySQL config/socket locations returned nothing. So currently we cannot run SQL because the client is missing and no local server is detected. To proceed we need a MySQL client available in the container (or access details for a remote server).",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the OS to choose a package manager (read /etc/os-release). 2) Check for common package managers (apt-get, yum, apk). 3) Look for any mysql/mariadb binaries in /usr/bin. 4) If apt-get exists, install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) so we can run mysql commands. 5) Verify installation by running 'mysql --version'. After the client is available, I'll ask you for the database connection details or the SQL question to run one SQL statement as required. Commands that may take time (apt operations) will have a longer duration.",
