  "analysis": "So far I inspected the container root at /app. The directory /app is empty. There is no mysql client binary (mysql: command not found). No MySQL server process appears to be running (ps output showed no mysqld). The usual MySQL runtime directory /var/run/mysqld does not exist. In short: no client, no server detected, and no obvious socket file present. To connect to a MySQL instance we either need a client and connection info (host/port/user/password) or a running local server. None of those are currently visible.",
  "plan": "I will search the environment and filesystem for any hints of MySQL connection information, socket files, or configuration files that might contain credentials (common locations: environment variables, .env files, /etc/mysql, docker-compose files). Steps/commands:\n1) Check environment variables for MYSQL-related variables (to find host/port/user/password or connection URL).\n2) List /etc/mysql to see if any configuration files exist.\n3) Search for a MySQL socket file (mysql.sock) anywhere on the filesystem.\n4) Find .env files (common place to store DB credentials) within a shallow depth so it's fast.\n5) Search common directories (/etc, /root, /home, /var) for files containing the string \"mysql\" to locate configs or connection strings.\n6) Look for docker-compose YAML files which might declare a mysql service and credentials.\nI expect each command to either return evidence of connection info or confirm absence, so we can decide whether to install a client, start a server, or attempt a remote connection.",
