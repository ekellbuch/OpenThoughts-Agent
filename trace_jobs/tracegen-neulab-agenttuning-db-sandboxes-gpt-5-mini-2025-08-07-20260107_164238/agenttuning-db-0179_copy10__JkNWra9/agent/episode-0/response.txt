  "analysis": "We have an interactive shell at root@f2378e7e0dc7:/app with no prior commands run in this session (just the initial shell messages). There's no visible MySQL activity yet. To operate a MySQL database we first need to discover whether the MySQL client or server is present and/or running, find sockets/config, then attempt a connection. Nothing has been attempted so far.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see project files that might reference a DB or contain credentials. 2) Check running processes to see if a MySQL/MariaDB server is running. 3) Check whether the mysql client binary is available. 4) Query the mysql client version if present. 5) Inspect the typical MySQL runtime directory (/var/run/mysqld) to see sockets or PID files. Based on results we'll decide the next step (attempt a connection or look for credentials/config).",
