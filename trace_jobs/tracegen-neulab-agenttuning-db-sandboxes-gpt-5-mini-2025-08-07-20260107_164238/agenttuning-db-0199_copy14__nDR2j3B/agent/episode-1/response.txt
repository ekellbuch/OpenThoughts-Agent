  "analysis": "From the previous commands: the current container working directory /app is empty. There are no mysqld/mariadb processes running. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). Therefore we currently cannot run SQL against a MySQL server from this container. To proceed we either need a MySQL client installed here and a reachable MySQL server (local socket or network host) or credentials/connection info. No server process or socket was found yet, and no mysql client is available.",
  "plan": "1) Identify the OS so we choose the correct package manager. 2) Search environment variables and common filesystem locations for any existing MySQL credentials or socket files (in case a server is present but not visible in processes). 3) Install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client) so we can connect to any server. 4) After installing the client, try mysql --version to confirm installation, then attempt a quick non-interactive connection as root to SHOW DATABASES; this will succeed only if a server is reachable (local or via env-provided host). If the connection fails, we'll inspect error output and then either ask for credentials/host or continue searching for socket/config files.",
