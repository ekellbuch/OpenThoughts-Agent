  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app inside a container. No MySQL commands have been run yet. There's no visible filesystem contents shown and no information about a running MySQL server or available credentials. To operate the database I need to (1) discover whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running, (2) confirm the mysql client is present, and (3) attempt a non-interactive connection to list databases. Depending on results I may need to locate socket files or config files (~/.my.cnf) or credentials.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see any project or credential files. 2) Check running processes to see if mysqld/mariadbd is active and its command line. 3) Check the mysql client version to confirm the client is installed. 4) Try a non-interactive mysql client connection as root to SHOW DATABASES; this will tell us if we can access the server without a password or if it fails and we need different credentials or socket information. If SHOW DATABASES works, we will proceed with the user's SQL requests. If it prompts for a password or fails, we will inspect possible credential files and common socket locations.",
