When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and approach, (2) either 'Operate' by outputting exactly one SQL statement (using the required Action: Operation format and a single-line SQL in a markdown code block) which you will execute and return the raw MySQL output for, or (3) if ready, produce a final 'Action: Answer' with the Final Answer array. Tell me which initial SQL to run (examples: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table; SELECT * FROM db.table LIMIT 10;) or ask your question directly.",
