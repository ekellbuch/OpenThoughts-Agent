  "analysis": "The environment has MySQL client and server installed and a mysqld process is running (socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock). I verified connectivity earlier with mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific question or SQL request has been given yet, and no further queries have been executed since the server was started. I'm ready to run queries as soon as you provide the question or tell me which SQL to execute.",
  "plan": "Await your database question. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and my approach. 2) Decide whether to 'Operate' (execute one SQL statement) or to directly 'Answer'. If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and iterate as needed until I can give a final answer. Typical first operations I may request (depending on your question) include: showing databases, showing tables in a specified database, or selecting rows from a specified table. Tell me the question or which first query you'd like me to run.",
