  "analysis": "The MySQL client is now installed but the client cannot connect because no mysqld socket exists. The mysql-server package was installed, and the installer messages said \"mysqld is running as pid 1175\" but policy-rc.d prevented service scripts from actually starting the server under the container init system. ps shows no mysqld process and /var/run/mysqld exists but contains no socket. To proceed we must initialize the data directory if needed and start a mysqld process directly in the container so the mysql client can connect and we can run SQL.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect /var/lib/mysql and the MySQL error log to determine whether the data directory is initialized and why the server isn't running. 2) If the data directory isn't initialized, initialize it with mysqld --initialize-insecure (so we can connect as root without a password). 3) Start mysqld directly in the background as the mysql user, using the existing datadir and socket path. 4) Verify the mysqld process and socket exist, then run mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to confirm we can run SQL. If initialization step is unnecessary it will fail harmlessly and the start step should still launch the server.\n\nCommands to be run (I will inspect logs, initialize if needed, start mysqld, then run SHOW DATABASES):",
