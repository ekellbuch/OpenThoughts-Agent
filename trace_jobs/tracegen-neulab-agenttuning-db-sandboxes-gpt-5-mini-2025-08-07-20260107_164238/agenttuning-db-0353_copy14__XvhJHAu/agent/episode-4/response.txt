  "analysis": "State summary: The container now has the MySQL client and server installed. The server data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized, and I started mysqld directly as the mysql user with --skip-networking and the socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The socket exists and the mysql client can connect as root without a password (server was initialized with --initialize-insecure). I verified connectivity by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet. Everything needed to run SQL statements interactively is available now.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. Once you ask a specific question about the data, I will:\n1) Explain my understanding of the question and my approach (show my thoughts). \n2) Propose a single SQL statement to run that will advance toward the answer. Per your rules, when I choose to operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You (or the test harness) will execute the SQL and return the raw MySQL output. \n3) I will analyze the returned output, possibly iterate with further single-statement operations, and repeat until I can produce a final answer. \nNotes: I will use the root account with no password (mysql -uroot) to run queries. If you want me to run a specific first query now (e.g., list databases, list tables in a database, show rows from a table), tell me which one or ask your question and I will produce the single SQL operation as described.",
