I started mysqld directly with socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and verified connectivity using mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No application-specific question or SQL request has been provided yet, and no further queries have been executed since the server was started. The environment is ready to run SQL statements as soon as you give a question or tell me which query to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide it I will: (1) explain my understanding and approach, (2) choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer'. If I choose to operate I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: a single-line SQL inside a markdown code block preceded by 'Action: Operation'. You (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I'll analyze it and iterate with further single-statement operations until I can provide the final answer. \n\nIf you don't yet have a specific question, tell me which initial SQL operation you'd like me to run now (examples):\n- SHOW DATABASES;\n- SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE your_database.your_table;\n- SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 10;\n\nTell me the question or which initial operation to run and I will produce the required single SQL statement.",
