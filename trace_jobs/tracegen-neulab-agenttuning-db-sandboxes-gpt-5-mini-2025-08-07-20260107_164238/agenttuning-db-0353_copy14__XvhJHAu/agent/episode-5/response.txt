The mysql client can connect as root without a password. I verified connectivity by running: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected yet.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide a question, I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and my approach (show my thoughts). 2) Choose to either operate (run a single SQL statement) or answer. If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and iterate until I can produce a final answer. If you want me to run a specific first query now (for example, list databases, show tables in a database, or SELECT rows from a table), tell me which and I will produce the single SQL statement as described.",
