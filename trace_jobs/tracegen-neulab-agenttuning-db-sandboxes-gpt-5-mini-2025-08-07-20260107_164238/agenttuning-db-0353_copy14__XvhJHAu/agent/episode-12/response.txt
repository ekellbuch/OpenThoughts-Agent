  "plan": "I'll wait for you to give the database question or tell me which initial SQL to execute. When you provide a question I will: (1) explain my understanding and approach, (2) choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer'. If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\n\nYou (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and iterate with further single-statement operations until I can produce the final answer. Example initial operations I can request if you don't specify: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;.\n\nTell me your database question or which initial query to run and I will produce the single required SQL operation.",
