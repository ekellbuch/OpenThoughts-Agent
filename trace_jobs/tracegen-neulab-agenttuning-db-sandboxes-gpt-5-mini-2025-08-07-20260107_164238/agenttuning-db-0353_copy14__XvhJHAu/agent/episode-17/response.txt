  "analysis": "MySQL client and server are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually (as user mysql) with --skip-networking and socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. The socket exists and the mysql client can connect as root without a password. A previous check returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected yet. I'm ready to run SQL against the server once you provide your database question or tell me which initial query to run.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide it I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and my approach; (2) choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer' (produce the final result). If I choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\n\nand you (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. To help you decide what to ask next, here are common initial actions I can perform — tell me which one you want or ask your specific question:\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n- Show table schema: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;\n- Inspect rows: SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;\n\nNo commands will be run now until you ask. If you want me to run one of the sample queries above immediately, tell me which and I will produce the single-statement Operation as required.",
