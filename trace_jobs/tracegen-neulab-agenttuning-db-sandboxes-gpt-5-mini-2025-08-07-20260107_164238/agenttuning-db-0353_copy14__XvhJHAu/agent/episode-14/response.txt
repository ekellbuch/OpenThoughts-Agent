The socket exists and the mysql client can connect as root with no password (server was initialized with --initialize-insecure). I verified connectivity earlier: mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected yet. The environment is ready to run SQL statements.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide a question I will: (1) explain my understanding of the question and my approach, showing my thoughts; (2) decide whether to 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or to provide a final 'Answer'; (3) if I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and iterate with further single-statement operations until I can produce the final answer. If you prefer, tell me which initial SQL to run now (examples): SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;.",
