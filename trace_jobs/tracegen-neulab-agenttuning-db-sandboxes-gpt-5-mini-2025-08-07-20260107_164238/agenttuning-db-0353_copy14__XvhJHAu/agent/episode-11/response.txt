  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide it I will: 1) explain my understanding and approach; 2) decide whether to operate (run exactly one SQL statement) or to answer; 3) if operating, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (\"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and iterate with further single-statement operations until a final answer can be produced. If you prefer, you may ask me to run one of these initial queries right away and I will produce the single-statement operation accordingly: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10; or another specific query.",
