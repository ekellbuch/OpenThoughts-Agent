  "analysis": "The last terminal line shows \"Killed\", indicating the mysqld process (or another process) was terminated (likely by the kernel OOM killer). Previously I had started mysqld manually and confirmed the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock existed and that the mysql client could connect. Now the server appears to be down again. To continue we need to confirm the current process state, inspect the MySQL error log for the cause, and attempt to restart mysqld so the client can run SQL. Nothing application-specific has been queried yet; the immediate task is to get the server running again and verify connectivity.",
  "plan": "1) Check for any running mysqld processes to confirm the server is not running. 2) Inspect the MySQL error log (tail the last 200 lines) to see why mysqld was killed. 3) Attempt to start mysqld in the background (run as mysql user) with --skip-networking and the known socket path. 4) Verify the mysqld process is running and that the socket exists. 5) Run a quick SQL: SHOW DATABASES; to confirm the server accepts connections. If the server dies again, the error log will show the reason and we can adjust. The commands below implement these steps.",
