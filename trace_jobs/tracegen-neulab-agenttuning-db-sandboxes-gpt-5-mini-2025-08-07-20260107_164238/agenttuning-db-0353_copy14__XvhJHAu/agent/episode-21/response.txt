  "analysis": "The MySQL server process in this container is repeatedly being terminated (last line shows \"Killed\"). Earlier we confirmed mysqld could run and accept connections, but it has been unstable — likely due to resource limits (OOM) in this environment. Right now there is no guarantee mysqld is running. To continue we must (1) confirm whether any mysqld process is active, (2) inspect the MySQL error log for hints about the kills, and (3) attempt to start mysqld again but with reduced memory usage to decrease the chance of it being killed (e.g., small InnoDB buffer pool and reduced max connections). After restarting, we'll verify the unix socket and try a simple SHOW DATABASES to confirm connectivity. If the server is still killed, the error log will be used to decide next steps.",
  "plan": "1) Check for running mysqld processes (ps). 2) Tail the last 200 lines of /var/log/mysql/error.log to look for recent errors or OOM messages. 3) Try to start mysqld in the background as the mysql user with reduced memory settings (--innodb-buffer-pool-size=8M and --max-connections=20) and --skip-networking and the same socket. 4) Verify the mysqld process is running (ps) and that /var/run/mysqld contains the socket. 5) Attempt a client connection using the unix socket and run SHOW DATABASES; to confirm the server is accepting queries. If mysqld is killed again, we'll read the logs and consider further memory reductions or other mitigations.\n\nCommands I will run (one-by-one):\n- ps aux | grep mysqld | grep -v grep  — check process list\n- tail -n 200 /var/log/mysql/error.log  — inspect recent server messages\n- runuser -u mysql -- /usr/sbin/mysqld --skip-networking --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --innodb-buffer-pool-size=8M --max-connections=20 &  — start server with lower memory usage\n- ps aux | grep mysqld | grep -v grep  — verify running process\n- ls -la /var/run/mysqld  — confirm socket presence\n- mysql -uroot --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"  — confirm connectivity",
