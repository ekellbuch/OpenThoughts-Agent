No question about the database has been asked yet. To proceed I need to connect to MySQL, discover what databases and tables exist, and then run the SQL you request. At this point nothing has been accomplished against MySQL.",

This will tell us whether the server is running and what databases exist. After seeing the output you provide, I'll propose the next precise SQL to run based on your question.\n\nCommands to run:\n- mysql --version to confirm client availability.\n- mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to list databases (this is the first SQL operation I'll ask to execute).",
