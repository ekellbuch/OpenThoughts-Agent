  "analysis": "The last terminal line shows \"Killed\", which likely means the mysqld process (or another process) was terminated (possibly by the OOM killer or similar). Previously we had mysqld running and a working socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, but that process appears to have been killed. The MySQL client may still be installed, but no server is currently accepting connections. To continue we need to confirm whether mysqld is running, inspect the MySQL error log to see why it was killed, and then attempt to restart mysqld (running it directly as the mysql user with the known socket and --skip-networking, as we did before). After restarting we will verify the socket and run SHOW DATABASES to confirm connectivity.",
  "plan": "1) Check for any running mysqld processes and inspect /var/run/mysqld to see if the socket exists.\n2) Tail the MySQL error log to look for recent messages explaining why the server was killed.\n3) Attempt to start mysqld in the background as the mysql user with the socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and --skip-networking.\n4) Verify the mysqld process and the socket file, then run mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" to confirm the server is accepting connections.\n\nI will run the following commands to perform those steps and validate the server is running again.",
