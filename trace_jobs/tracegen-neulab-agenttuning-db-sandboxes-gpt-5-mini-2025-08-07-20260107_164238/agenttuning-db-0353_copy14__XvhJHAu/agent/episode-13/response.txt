A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys.

When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and approach, (2) choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer'. If I operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and iterate with further single-statement operations until I can produce the final answer. If you want me to run an initial query now, tell me which of these (or provide your own): SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;.",
