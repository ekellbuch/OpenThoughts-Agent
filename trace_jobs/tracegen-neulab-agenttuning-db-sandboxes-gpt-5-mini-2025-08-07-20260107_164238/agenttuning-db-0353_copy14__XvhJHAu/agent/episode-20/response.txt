  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld directly (as user mysql) with --skip-networking and socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. After several restarts (some were killed, likely due to resource constraints), a mysqld process is currently running (pid 1867) and the unix socket exists. I verified connectivity by running: mysql -uroot --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific database or table queries have been executed yet, and you have not asked a specific database question yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide it I will: (1) restate the question and explain my understanding and approach, (2) choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer'. Per your rules, if I 'Operate' I will output a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). You (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and iterate with further single-statement operations until I can produce the final answer. If you want me to run an initial SQL now, tell me which one (examples): SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <dbname>.<table> LIMIT 10;. I will then produce the required single-statement Operation.",
