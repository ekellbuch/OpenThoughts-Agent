  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are now installed and running in the container. Earlier the mysqld process was killed (likely OOM or similar), but you restarted it; a mysqld process is running again (pid shown) and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. I confirmed connectivity by running mysql -uroot -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\" which returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL queries via the mysql client.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and my approach (showing thought process), (2) choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer' (give final result). If I choose to operate I will output a single SQL statement in the required format:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>\n```\n\nYou (or the harness) will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and, if needed, iterate with further single-statement operations until I can produce the final answer. If you want me to start by listing databases, listing tables in a specific database, showing a table schema, or selecting rows from a table, tell me which and I will produce the single SQL operation accordingly.",
