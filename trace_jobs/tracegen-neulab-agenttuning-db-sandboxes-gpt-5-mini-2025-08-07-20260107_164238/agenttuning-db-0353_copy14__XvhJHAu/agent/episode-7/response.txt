  "plan": "I'll wait for your database question. When you provide it I will: 1) Explain my understanding of the question and my approach. 2) Choose to either 'Operate' (execute exactly one SQL statement) or 'Answer' (provide final results). If I choose to operate, I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either run another single SQL statement or produce the final answer. \n\nIf you don't have a specific question yet, tell me which of these first operations you'd like me to run now (I'll then provide the single-statement Operation as described):\n- List databases: SHOW DATABASES;\n- List tables in a database (replace dbname): SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;\n- Show schema of a table (replace dbname and table): SHOW CREATE TABLE dbname.table;\n- Select rows from a table (replace dbname and table): SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10;\n\nTell me your question or which initial operation to run.",
