  "analysis": "The container now has a working MySQL server and client. I installed default-mysql-client and default-mysql-server, initialized the data directory, and started mysqld directly as the mysql user with socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and --skip-networking. The mysql client can connect as root without a password. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No application-specific databases, tables, or queries have been inspected yet. I am ready to run SQL once you provide the database question or tell me which query to run.",
  "plan": "Wait for your database question or the initial query you want executed. When you provide the question I will: (1) explain my understanding and the approach I will take, (2) decide whether to 'Operate' (run a single SQL statement) or 'Answer', and if operating I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement in a markdown code block). After you execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the result and iterate with further single-statement operations until I can produce a final answer. No SQL will be executed now until you specify the question or initial operation.",
