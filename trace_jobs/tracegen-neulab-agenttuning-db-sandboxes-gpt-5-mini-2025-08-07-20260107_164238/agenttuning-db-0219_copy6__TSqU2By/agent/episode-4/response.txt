  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running. I verified connectivity with mysql -u root and confirmed version 10.11.13 and the default databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user databases or tables to inspect. No further shell actions are needed until you tell me what question you want answered against the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact question you want answered (for example: list tables in a specific database, show the schema of a table, count rows, or run a custom SELECT). Once you provide the question and identify the target database/table, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) to run. After you execute that statement and provide the output, I will analyze the result and either (a) issue another single SQL statement in the next round or (b) deliver the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when I'm certain of the result.",
