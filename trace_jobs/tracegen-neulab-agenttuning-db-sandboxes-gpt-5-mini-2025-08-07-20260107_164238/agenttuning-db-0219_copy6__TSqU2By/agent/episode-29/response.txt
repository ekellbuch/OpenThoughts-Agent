The server is responsive and the mysql client works as root. No further user instruction has been provided, so the next sensible inspection is to list tables in the sample_db to confirm the table(s) present.",
  "plan": "Run a single SQL statement to list all tables in sample_db. This will confirm the presence of the employees table and allow planning of any subsequent DESCRIBE or SELECT operations. I will execute mysql -u root -e \"SHOW TABLES FROM sample_db;\" so the output returns the list of tables in that database.",
