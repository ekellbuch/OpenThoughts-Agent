A prior SHOW DATABASES; returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. The shell is idle in /app and no new SQL or shell commands have been executed in this round because you have not specified a database question or requested any operation.",

Choose one action and provide any names/details required:\n\n- Inspect existing data:\n  * List tables in a database (I will run: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;)\n  * Describe a table schema (I will run: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;)\n  * Preview rows (I will run: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10;)\n  * Count rows (I will run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;)\n  * Run a custom SELECT (you provide the SELECT)\n\n- Create test data:\n  * Create a new database and table and insert sample data (tell me a database name and schema or say 'create test database')\n\nWhen you specify which action and the target (database/table names or the SQL you want run), I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format to execute. You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
