Pick one of the following and provide any names/details required:\n\n- Inspect an existing database/table:\n  * List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n  * Describe a table schema: DESCRIBE your_db.your_table;\n  * Preview rows: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table LIMIT 10;\n  * Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n  * Run a custom SELECT: provide the SELECT you want.\n\n- Create test data (if you want me to create a sample database/tables so you can query them): specify a database name and table/schema or say 'create test database' and I will create one and insert sample rows.\n\nWhen you specify which action you want and provide the target database/table names (or ask me to create a test database), I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and provide the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL statement or give the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
