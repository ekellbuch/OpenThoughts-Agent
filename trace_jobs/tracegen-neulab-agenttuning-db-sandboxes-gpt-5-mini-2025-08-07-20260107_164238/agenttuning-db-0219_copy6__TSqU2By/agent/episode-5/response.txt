I verified connectivity and listed databases; only the default system databases exist: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present yet. No further SQL has been executed in this round because you haven't specified the question or target database/table to inspect.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact question you want answered against the database. Examples of possible requests: list databases, list tables in a specific database, show a table schema, preview rows from a table, or run a custom SELECT. Once you specify the target (database and/or table) and the question, I will provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) to run. After you execute that SQL and return its output, I will analyze the result and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.",
