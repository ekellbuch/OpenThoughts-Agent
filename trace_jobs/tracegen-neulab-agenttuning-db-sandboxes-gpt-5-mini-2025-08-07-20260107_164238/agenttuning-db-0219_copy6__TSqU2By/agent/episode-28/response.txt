I created a test database sample_db and a table sample_db.employees and inserted three rows (Alice, Bob, Carol). SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees; returned the inserted rows. The server is responsive and I can run SQL as root. Currently there are no other user databases; the environment is idle at /app and you have not specified the next database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what you want me to do next against the database. Choose one action and I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) for you to execute. Example actions you can request (pick one and name database/table if needed):\n- List tables in sample_db: SHOW TABLES FROM sample_db;\n- Describe the employees table: DESCRIBE sample_db.employees;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sample_db.employees;\n- Query rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n- Insert/update/delete rows or create additional tables (specify details).\n\nWhen you tell me which action you want, I will either:\n- Operate: provide a single SQL statement in the required SQL code block (Action: Operation) for you to execute, or\n- Answer: if you indicate you want the final answer, I will provide the Action: Answer block.\n\nPlease reply with which operation you want (or say 'create more test data' with details, or 'Answer' to finish).",
