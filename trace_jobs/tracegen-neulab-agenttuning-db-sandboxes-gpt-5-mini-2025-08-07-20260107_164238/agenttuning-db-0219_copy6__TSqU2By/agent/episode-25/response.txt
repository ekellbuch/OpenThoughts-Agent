  "analysis": "I created a test database sample_db and a table sample_db.employees with three rows (Alice, Bob, Carol). Verified with SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees; which returned the 3 inserted rows. Current state: MariaDB is running, mysql client works as root, and sample_db.employees exists with data. There are no other user databases or tables to inspect.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to specify the question you want answered against the database or pick one of the example operations below. When you choose an operation, I'll produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format) to run. Example operations you can request: \n- Show tables in sample_db: SHOW TABLES FROM sample_db;\n- Describe the employees table schema: DESCRIBE sample_db.employees;\n- Preview rows (already done): SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees LIMIT 10;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sample_db.employees;\n- Select employees with salary > X: SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n- Add or modify data (CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE) — specify desired change.\n\nTell me which of the above (or provide your own SQL question). If you want me to operate now, say so; I will respond with Action: Operation and a single SQL statement in a SQL code block per your rules.",
