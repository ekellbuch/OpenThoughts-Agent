  "analysis": "MariaDB 10.11.13 is installed and running on this Ubuntu 24.04 container and the mysql client works as root. I connected and confirmed the server: SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system databases (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user-created databases or tables to inspect. The shell is idle in /app and no further SQL has been executed in this round because you have not specified a question or requested an operation to perform against the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Options you can request include:\n- Inspect: list tables in a database, describe a table schema, preview rows, count rows, or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create: create a new database and table and insert sample data.\n\nWhen you specify the exact action and provide any necessary names (database/table) or the custom SQL, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
