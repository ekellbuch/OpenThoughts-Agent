  "analysis": "MariaDB 10.11.13 is installed and running on this Ubuntu 24.04 container. I can connect as root with the mysql client. A prior SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user-created databases or tables to inspect. The shell is idle at /app and no SQL has been executed in this round because you haven't specified a question or operation to perform against the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Pick one and provide names if relevant. Options include: (1) Inspect an existing database/table (e.g., list tables, describe a table, preview rows, count rows, run a SELECT), (2) Create a new database/table and insert sample data, or (3) Provide a custom SQL query to run. Once you specify the action and target (database/table and what to retrieve or change), I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run it and give me the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
