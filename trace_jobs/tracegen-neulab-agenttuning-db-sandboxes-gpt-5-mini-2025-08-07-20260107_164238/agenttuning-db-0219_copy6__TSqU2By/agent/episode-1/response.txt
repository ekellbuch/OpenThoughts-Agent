  "analysis": "The environment currently has no mysql client and no MySQL data directory: 'which mysql' returned nothing, 'mysql --version' reports command not found, /var/lib/mysql doesn't exist, and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf is missing. No mysqld process is running. The /app directory is empty. Therefore there is no accessible MySQL server or client currently installed on this system. To run SQL against a MySQL server we must either install a MySQL/MariaDB server and client locally or connect to a remote server (no remote credentials available).",
  "plan": "1) Detect the package manager and OS to choose appropriate packages.\n2) Install a MySQL-compatible server and client (use MariaDB which is commonly available) so we have both server (mysqld) and the mysql client binary.\n3) Start the database service.\n4) Verify the mysql client can connect locally and report server version. After that I will ask you for the actual SQL question to run or proceed to execute a single SQL statement per your instructions.\n\nCommands will: (a) check for apt-get and OS details, (b) update package lists, (c) install mariadb-server and mariadb-client, (d) start the service, (e) run a simple SQL to verify connectivity.",
