A previous SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables to inspect. The shell is idle at /app and no new SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to specify the exact question you want answered against the database. For example, you can ask me to: (a) list tables in a given database, (b) describe the schema of a specific table, (c) preview rows from a table, (d) count rows, (e) run a custom SELECT, or (f) create a database/table and insert sample data. Once you tell me which database/table and what you want, I will either:\n- Operate: provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) for you to execute and return the output, or\n- Answer: produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when certain.\n\nPlease state your question and the target database/table (or say you want me to create a test database).",
