I previously connected as root and confirmed the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user-created databases or tables present. The shell is idle in /app and no further SQL has been executed in this round because you have not specified the question or operation you want performed against the database.",

Options you can request include:\n- Inspect: list tables in a database, describe a table schema, preview rows, count rows, or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create: create a new database/table and insert data for testing.\n\nOnce you specify the target database/table and the desired action, I will either:\n- Operate: provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) for you to execute and return the output, or\n- Answer: produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern if I'm certain of the result.\n\nTell me which database/table and what you want me to do next (or say 'create test database' if you'd like me to create sample data).",
