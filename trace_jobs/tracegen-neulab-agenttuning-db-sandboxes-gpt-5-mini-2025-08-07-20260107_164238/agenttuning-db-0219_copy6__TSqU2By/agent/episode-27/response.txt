  "analysis": "MariaDB 10.11.13 is installed and running on this Ubuntu 24.04 container. I created a test database sample_db and a table sample_db.employees and inserted three rows (Alice, Bob, Carol). A SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees; confirmed the rows. The mysql client works as root and there are no other user databases present. The shell is idle at /app and you have not specified a next database question or operation.",
  "plan": "Wait for your instruction which single SQL operation you want next. Options I can perform (each will be returned as exactly one SQL statement in the required format when you ask me to Operate):\n- List tables in sample_db: SHOW TABLES FROM sample_db;\n- Describe the employees table: DESCRIBE sample_db.employees;\n- Count rows in employees: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sample_db.employees;\n- Query rows with a condition, e.g. salary > 50000: SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n- Insert/update/delete rows or create additional tables — specify desired changes.\n\nTell me which operation you want me to run (or say 'Answer' to finalize an answer). Once you choose, I will produce a single SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run it and return the MySQL output, I will analyze and continue or provide the final answer.",
