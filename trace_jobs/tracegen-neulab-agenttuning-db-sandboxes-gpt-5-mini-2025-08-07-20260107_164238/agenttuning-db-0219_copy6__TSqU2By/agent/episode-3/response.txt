  "analysis": "I installed MariaDB, started the server, and verified connectivity. The server is running (version 10.11.13) and SHOW DATABASES returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases are present yet in /app. What has been accomplished: a working MariaDB server and mysql client are available and responsive. What remains: I need your specific question about the database so I can run the appropriate SQL. Depending on your question, I may need to inspect a specific database's tables, schema, or rows. Per your rules, each interaction where I 'operate' will issue exactly one SQL statement in a SQL code block, and you will execute it and return the output.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further shell commands until you tell me the exact question you want answered. Tell me what you want to know (examples below). Once you give the question, I'll choose one SQL statement to run (only one per round) and will present it in the required format.\n\nExamples of operations I can run once you specify the target database or table:\n- To see databases (already done): mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\"\n- To list tables in a database named mydb: mysql -u root -e \"SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;\"\n- To show schema of a table mytable in mydb: mysql -u root -e \"DESCRIBE mydb.mytable;\"\n- To preview rows from mydb.mytable: mysql -u root -e \"SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable LIMIT 10;\"\n- To count rows in mydb.mytable: mysql -u root -e \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.mytable;\"\n\nTell me which database/table and what you want to find, and I will (a) produce one SQL statement in the required format to run, or (b) if you're ready for a final answer, indicate that and I will provide the Action: Answer block.",
