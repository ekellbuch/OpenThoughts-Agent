I verified connectivity as root and confirmed the server with SHOW DATABASES; the only databases present are the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables to inspect. The shell is idle in /app and you have not provided a specific database question or requested any operation yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Possible requests include:\n- Inspect: list tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM db;), describe a table (DESCRIBE db.tbl;), preview rows (SELECT * FROM db.tbl LIMIT 10;), count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.tbl;), or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create: create a new database and table and insert sample data (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, etc.).\n\nWhen you specify the exact action and target database/table (or ask me to create a test database), I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format to run. You will execute that statement and provide its raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
