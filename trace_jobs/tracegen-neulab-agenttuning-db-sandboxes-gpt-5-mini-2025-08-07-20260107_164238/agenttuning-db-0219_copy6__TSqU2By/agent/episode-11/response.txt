I verified connectivity as root and SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user databases or tables to inspect. The shell is idle at /app and no further SQL has been executed in this round because you have not specified the database question or operation to perform.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact question or operation you want performed against the database. Possible requests:\n- Inspect: list tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM db;), describe a table (DESCRIBE db.tbl;), preview rows (SELECT * FROM db.tbl LIMIT 10;), count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.tbl;)\n- Create: create a database and tables and insert sample data (CREATE DATABASE db; CREATE TABLE db.tbl (...); INSERT INTO db.tbl ...;)\n\nWhen you specify what you want, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) to run. You will execute it and return the raw MySQL output, and I will analyze that output and either provide another single SQL statement or, if certain, issue the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nTell me which database/table to target or whether you want me to create a test database and tables. If you provide the question now, I'll respond with the single SQL statement to execute.",
