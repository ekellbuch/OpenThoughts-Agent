Options you can request (pick one and provide names if relevant):\n- Inspect: list tables in a database, describe a table schema, preview rows, count rows, or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create: create a new database and table and insert sample data (if you want a test dataset).\n\nOnce you specify the target database/table and the desired action I will either:\n- Operate: provide exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) for you to execute and return the output, or\n- Answer: provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when certain.\n\nPlease state which action you want and the target database/table names (or say 'create test database' if you'd like me to create sample data).",
