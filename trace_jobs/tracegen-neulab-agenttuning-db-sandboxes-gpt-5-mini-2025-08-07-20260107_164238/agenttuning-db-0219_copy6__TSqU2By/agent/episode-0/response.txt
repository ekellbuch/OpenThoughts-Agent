  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app with no prior commands run in this session. No MySQL interaction has been performed yet. To answer questions against a MySQL database I need to (1) confirm whether the mysql client is available, (2) see if a MySQL server (mysqld) is running, and (3) locate any local credentials (for example in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf or environment variables) or database files in /var/lib/mysql. Once I find credentials or confirm an unsecured root socket, I can run a single SQL statement (per your rules) and then iterate based on the returned output.",
  "plan": "1) Check for the mysql client binary and its version to ensure we can connect.\n2) Check whether a MySQL server process is running.\n3) Inspect /var/lib/mysql to see if data files exist (indicates a local server).\n4) Attempt to read /etc/mysql/debian.cnf which on Debian/Ubuntu systems often contains maintenance user credentials that allow non-interactive access.\n5) Check environment variables for MYSQL-related credentials (e.g., MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD).\n6) List /app in case there are SQL dumps or scripts with credentials.\n\nBased on the results of these checks I will either (a) use discovered credentials to run a single SQL statement you request, or (b) report what I found and ask for further instruction. Each step below is a single shell command. I will not run any direct interactive mysql command until I can supply credentials or verify access.",
