I connected as root and verified the server; SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables to inspect under the server. The shell is idle in /app and no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact question you want answered against the database (for example: list tables in a database, show a table schema, preview rows from a table, count rows, or run a specific SELECT). If you want me to create a database and tables, say so. Once you provide the question and identify the target database/table, I will either:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) to run; you will execute it and return the output, or\n- Answer: when certain, produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nExamples of SQL I can produce when you request an operation (you don't need to type these; they're examples of what I'll send as a single SQL statement):\n- SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;  (lists tables in database mydb)\n- DESCRIBE mydb.mytable;  (shows schema of mydb.mytable)\n- SELECT * FROM mydb.mytable LIMIT 10;  (preview rows)\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mydb.mytable;  (row count)\n\nTell me what you want me to do next and which database/table to target. I will then provide one SQL statement to run.",
