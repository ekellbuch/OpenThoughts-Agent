The shell is idle at /app and no new SQL or shell commands have been executed in this round because you have not provided a database question or requested any operation.",

Options you can request (pick one and provide any names if relevant):\n- Inspect: list tables in a database, describe a table schema, preview rows, count rows, or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create: create a new database and table and insert sample data.\n\nWhen you specify the action and target (database/table or that I should create a test database), I will either:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) for you to execute and return the output, or\n- Answer: provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern when certain.\n\nTell me which action you want and the database/table names (or say 'create test database') and I will produce the next single SQL statement.",
