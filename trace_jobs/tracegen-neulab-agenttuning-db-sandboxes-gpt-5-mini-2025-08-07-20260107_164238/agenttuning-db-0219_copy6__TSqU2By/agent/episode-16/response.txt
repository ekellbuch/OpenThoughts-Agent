  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me exactly what you want done against the database. Choose one of the following high-level actions and provide any names you want used (database/table), or ask me to proceed with one of them:\n\n1) Inspect existing databases/tables:\n   - Show databases (already done).\n   - List tables in a specific database.\n   - Show schema (DESCRIBE) for a table.\n   - Preview rows (SELECT * ... LIMIT ...).\n   - Count rows in a table.\n\n2) Create test data:\n   - Create a new database and one or more tables and insert sample rows so you can query them.\n\n3) Run a specific custom query you provide.\n\nWhen you pick an action, I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL statement or produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nTell me which action you want and any names/details (database name, table name, columns, sample data, or the SQL you want run).",
