  "analysis": "MariaDB 10.11.13 is installed and running on this Ubuntu 24.04 container. I confirmed connectivity as root with the mysql client and SHOW DATABASES returned only the default system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are currently no user-created databases or tables to inspect. The shell is idle in /app and no further SQL has been executed in this round because you have not specified the database question or operation you want performed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Please choose one and provide any names/details required (database name, table name, columns, or a custom query). Options you can request:\n- Inspect existing data: list tables in a database, describe a table schema, preview rows (SELECT * ... LIMIT ...), count rows, or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create test data: create a new database and table and insert sample rows so you can query them.\n\nWhen you specify the action and provide the target (database/table or request to create test data), I will produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required single SQL code block format) for you to execute. After you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the result and either issue another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
