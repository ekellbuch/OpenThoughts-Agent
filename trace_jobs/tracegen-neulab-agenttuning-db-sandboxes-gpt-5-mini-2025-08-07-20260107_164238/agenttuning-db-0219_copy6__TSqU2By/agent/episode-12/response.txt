  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. Options you can request (pick one and provide names if relevant):\n- Inspect: list tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM db;), describe a table (DESCRIBE db.tbl;), preview rows (SELECT * FROM db.tbl LIMIT 10;), count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.tbl;), or run a custom SELECT.\n- Create: create a new database and table and insert sample data (I will then run one CREATE/INSERT statement per round if you ask).\n\nOnce you specify the exact question and target (database and/or table), I will either:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required SQL code block format) for you to execute and return the output, or\n- Answer: when certain, produce the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.\n\nPlease state which action you want and the target database/table names (or say 'create test database' if you want me to create sample data).",
