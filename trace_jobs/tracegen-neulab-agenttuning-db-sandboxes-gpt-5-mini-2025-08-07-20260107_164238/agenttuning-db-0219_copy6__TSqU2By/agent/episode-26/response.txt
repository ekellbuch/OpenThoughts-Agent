  "analysis": "MariaDB is installed and running (10.11.13). I created a test database sample_db and a table sample_db.employees with three rows (id 1..3: Alice, Bob, Carol). The server and client work as root and SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees; returned the inserted rows. The environment is idle at /app and no further SQL has been executed in this round.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to specify the exact database question or operation you want performed. Examples you can ask for (pick one):\n- List tables in sample_db: SHOW TABLES FROM sample_db;\n- Describe the employees table: DESCRIBE sample_db.employees;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sample_db.employees;\n- Query rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM sample_db.employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n- Insert, update, or delete rows: provide details and I will produce the appropriate SQL.\n\nWhen you pick one operation, I will produce exactly one SQL statement (per your rules) in the required format to run. After you execute it and provide the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze that output and either produce another single SQL statement or deliver the final answer using the Action: Answer pattern.",
