Before I can construct or execute any SQL, I need to know the user's question and/or database credentials or confirm a local MySQL server/client is available to connect to. I haven't executed any commands yet; the next steps should detect whether a MySQL client/server exist and where the data/config files are, so we can plan a proper connection and then run the SQL the user requests.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a running MySQL/MariaDB process. 2) Check whether the mysql client binary exists and its version. 3) Inspect common MySQL directories (/var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql) to see if a local server and config are present. 4) After these checks I'll report findings and ask you to provide the SQL question and any credentials (host, port, user, password, socket) if needed. If a local socket and credentials are available, I'll attempt to connect and then we can issue the single-line SQL statement you provide. The commands below perform the checks and return info quickly.",
