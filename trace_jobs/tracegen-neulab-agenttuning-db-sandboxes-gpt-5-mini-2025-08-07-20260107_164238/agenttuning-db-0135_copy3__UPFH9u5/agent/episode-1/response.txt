  "analysis": "The environment currently has no MySQL client or server available. The mysql binary is not found, there are no mysqld processes, and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. Therefore we cannot run any SQL yet. To proceed we need a MySQL client (or a running MySQL server or remote credentials). Before trying to install anything, we should detect what package manager is available in this container so we can install a client if possible. If you instead plan to connect to a remote MySQL server, provide the hostname, port, username, and password (or socket) and I will craft the connection command and SQL.",
  "plan": "1) Detect which package manager is available (apt-get, apk, yum, or dnf). This tells us how to install a MySQL client. 2) After detection, I will install a MySQL client appropriate for that manager (e.g., default-mysql-client for Debian/Ubuntu apt, mariadb-client for Alpine/Alpine's apk or RHEL). 3) Verify the client is installed (mysql --version). 4) Attempt a connection or ask you for connection credentials if the server is remote or not running locally.\n\nI'll first run simple checks to find the available package manager.",
