The mysql binary is not found, there are no mysqld processes, and /var/lib/mysql does not exist. Therefore we cannot run any SQL yet. To proceed we need a MySQL client (or a running MySQL server or remote credentials). Before trying to install anything, we should detect what package manager is available in this container so we can install a client if possible.

This tells us how to install a MySQL client. 2) After detection, I will install a MySQL client appropriate for that manager (e.g., default-mysql-client for Debian/Ubuntu apt, mariadb-client for Alpine/Alpine's apk or RHEL). 3) Verify the client is installed (mysql --version). 4) Attempt a connection or ask you for connection credentials if the server is remote or not running locally.\\\\n\\\\nI'll first run simple checks to find the available package manager.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which apt-get\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which apk\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which yum\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"which dnf\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"annotations\": [], \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1767823362, \"model\": \"gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 960, \"prompt_tokens\": 1573, \"total_tokens\": 2533, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 576, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}",
