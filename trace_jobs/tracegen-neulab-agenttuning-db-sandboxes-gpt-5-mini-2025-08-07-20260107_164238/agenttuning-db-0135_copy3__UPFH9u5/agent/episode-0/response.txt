  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app with no commands running. There's no information yet about a MySQL server or client availability, nor any database credentials. Nothing has been accomplished toward answering a database question because no SQL has been run yet. Before you can operate on the database I need to detect whether the mysql client is installed, whether a mysqld server is running on this host, and whether I can connect (for example as root without a password).",
  "plan": "1) Check whether the mysql client binary is available (which mysql and mysql --version).\n2) Check whether a mysqld server process is running (ps). 3) Inspect the typical MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) to see if database files exist. 4) Attempt a simple test connection running a one-line SQL (SELECT VERSION()) as root without a password to see if we can talk to the server. If the connection fails, I'll report the error so you can provide credentials or other connection details. Each command is chosen to quickly discover the environment and whether we can proceed to run actual SQL queries for your question.",
