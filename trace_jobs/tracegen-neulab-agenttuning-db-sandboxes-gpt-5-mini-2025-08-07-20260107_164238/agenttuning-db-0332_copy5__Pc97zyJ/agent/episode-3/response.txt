Also ask you to provide any helpful schema/table names or samples if known. Once you reply with the question and execution method, I will explain my assumptions and plan, then supply exactly one SQL statement in a single markdown SQL code block (one line) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and continue iteratively until I can produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.",
