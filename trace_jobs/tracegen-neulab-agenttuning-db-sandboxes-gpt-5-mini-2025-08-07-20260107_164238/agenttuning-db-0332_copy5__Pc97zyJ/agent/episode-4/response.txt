Until you provide the question and confirm the execution method, I cannot produce the one-line SQL statement required by the interaction protocol.",

Once you reply with the question and execution method, I will (a) explain my assumptions and plan, and (b) provide exactly one SQL statement in a single markdown SQL code block (one line) for you to execute. After you run it and paste the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze results and either request another single SQL statement or provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer format.",
