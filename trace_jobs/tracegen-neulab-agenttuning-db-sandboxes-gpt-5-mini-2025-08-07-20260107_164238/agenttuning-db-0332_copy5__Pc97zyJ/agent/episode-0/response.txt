  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt inside a container (root@ff2ffbf9ba3b:/app#). There is no evidence of a MySQL connection or any database query having been run. The task instructions say you (the user) will ask a question about the MySQL database and I must propose exactly one SQL statement (inside a markdown SQL code block) per operation step; you will execute the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output back to me. I must also explain my reasoning and may iterate: propose SQL, you run it, you give me the output, I analyze and propose next SQL, etc., until I'm ready to produce the final answer in the specified Action: Answer format.\n\nWhat has been accomplished: nothing yet with the database. What still needs to be done: you must tell me the question you want answered and provide (or confirm) how I should connect to the database (e.g., tell me connection credentials or confirm you'll run the SQL I provide). Once you give the question, I'll think through the schema assumptions, explain my plan and thoughts, then produce a single SQL statement per step (in the required markdown block). You will run that SQL and paste the MySQL raw output back here. We'll repeat until we can finalize the answer.",
  "plan": "1) Ask you to provide the question you want answered and any necessary DB connection info or confirm that you'll run the SQL I give. 2) Once you provide the question (and optionally table/schema hints), I'll think through possible schema and constraints, explain my reasoning, and produce exactly one SQL statement in a markdown SQL block (one-line). 3) You'll run that SQL and return the MySQL output. 4) I'll inspect the output, update my reasoning, and either produce another single SQL statement to refine the answer or, if I have enough information, produce the final answer using the required Action: Answer format. The next command will simply prompt you to supply the question and connection details so we can begin.",
