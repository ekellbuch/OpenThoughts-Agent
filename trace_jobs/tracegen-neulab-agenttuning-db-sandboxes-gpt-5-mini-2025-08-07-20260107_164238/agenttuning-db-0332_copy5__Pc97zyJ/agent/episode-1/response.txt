I will also remind you of the strict interaction protocol you specified: every operation I request must be exactly one SQL statement placed inside a single markdown SQL code block (one line), and you will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. After you run that SQL and paste the output here, I'll analyze it and either request another single SQL statement or, if I can conclude, produce the final answer using the required Action: Answer format. Next I'll prompt you to supply your question and confirm how you'll execute SQL.",
