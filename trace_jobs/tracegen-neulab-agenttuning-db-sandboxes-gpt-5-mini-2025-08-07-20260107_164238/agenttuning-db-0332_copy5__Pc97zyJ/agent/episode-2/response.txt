The user has not yet provided the specific MySQL question or confirmed whether they will execute SQL statements I provide (option A) or supply DB credentials (option B). According to the interaction protocol you set, I must provide exactly one SQL statement per operation inside a single markdown SQL code block and you will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. We cannot proceed to query the database until the user provides the question and confirms how SQL will be executed.",

Once you confirm and give the question, I will (1) explain my assumptions and plan in detail, and (2) provide a single SQL statement in a markdown SQL code block (one line) for you to run. After you run it and paste the output, I'll analyze results and either produce another single SQL statement or conclude with the final answer in the required Action: Answer format.",
