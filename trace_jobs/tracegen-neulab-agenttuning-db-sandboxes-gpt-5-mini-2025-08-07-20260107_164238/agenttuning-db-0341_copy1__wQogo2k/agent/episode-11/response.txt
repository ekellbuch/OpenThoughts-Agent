  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and there are no credentials or environment variables present to connect to a remote server. You have not provided the natural-language question or the database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Without a reachable database endpoint and the question/schema info I cannot run any SQL or retrieve data.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide two things so I can proceed: 1) The exact question you want answered (natural-language or specify which table(s), columns, and filters to query). 2) Database connection details so I can either run the query from this shell or produce the single-line SQL for you to execute. Required connection info: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf / prompt), and database name (if applicable). Options once you provide info: - If you want me to run the query here, I will provide a small sequence of shell commands that invokes the mysql client non-interactively to execute exactly one SQL statement (mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\"). - If you prefer to run the SQL yourself, tell me and I will output exactly one SQL statement wrapped in the required format: start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL statement in a fenced code block (one-line SQL only). Note: per your rules I will only include SQL when explicitly performing an operation; each operation will contain exactly one SQL statement. If providing credentials here, please be careful with shell quoting for special characters in passwords (use -p'PASSWORD' or ~/.my.cnf).",
