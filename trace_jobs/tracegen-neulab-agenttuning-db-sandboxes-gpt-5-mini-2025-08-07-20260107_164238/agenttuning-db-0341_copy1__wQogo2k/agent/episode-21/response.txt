  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container where the mysql client (mysql 8.0) has been installed successfully. There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process), and I found no credentials or environment variables for a remote DB. You have not yet supplied a natural-language question to answer nor any database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Because of that, I cannot execute any SQL or return query results from a database at this time.",
  "plan": "I will not run further system commands until you choose how you want to proceed. Please pick one of these options and supply the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote database (recommended if you already have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf / no password), and database name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (natural-language or specify table(s)/columns/filters).\n- Tell me whether you want me to run the SQL here (you must supply credentials and explicitly allow this) or whether you will run the SQL yourself and return the output.\n\nIf you want me to run the query here, I will place a single non-interactive mysql client command in the \"commands\" array to execute exactly one SQL statement (for example: mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\"). If you prefer to run it yourself, I will produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (see below) for you to run and return output.\n\nOption B — You run SQL yourself: \n- Provide the exact question (or table/schema/filters) and I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement formatted as you requested: I will output \"Action: Operation\" followed by one SQL statement inside a fenced code block. You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption C — Create a local DB inside the container: \n- Confirm you want a local MySQL/MariaDB server installed and which package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server). If you confirm, I will (only after your confirmation) install and initialize a server and then run queries locally. Note: this modifies the container (installs packages and starts a service).\n\nImportant rules and templates you must follow when interacting with me for operations:\n- When you want me to perform an operation, I will output: \"Action: Operation\" and then a single SQL statement inside a fenced code block (SQL must be one line). You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n- I will only ever emit one SQL statement per operation. After you run it and return results, I will analyze and either request another operation or finish with: \"Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [ ... ]\" when I'm sure of the final answer.\n- If you allow me to run queries here and provide credentials, the non-interactive mysql client template I will use is: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<ONE_SQL_STATEMENT>;\"\n  - Note: if you provide the password, quote with single quotes (-p'PASSWORD') to reduce shell-quoting issues; or provide a ~/.my.cnf to avoid passing the password on the command line.\n\nPlease reply with one of these: (A) connection details + the exact question + whether I should run the query here, or (B) the exact question and confirmation that you will run the SQL I produce, or (C) confirm you want me to install a local DB and which server package to use. Once you provide that, I will produce the next-step output (either the single-line SQL in the required format, or the commands to run the query here).",
