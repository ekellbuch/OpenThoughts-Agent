  "analysis": "Current state: The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the mysql client (mysql 8.0) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process). No credentials, environment variables, or client config files containing connection info were found. You have not provided the natural-language question to answer nor any database connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run further system commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. There are three clear options; choose one and provide the requested details: 1) Query a remote database (recommended if you already have one): - Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf), and database name (if applicable). - Provide the exact question you want answered (natural-language or table/column/condition description). After you provide these, I will produce a single-line SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation and a single SQL statement in a fenced code block) for you to execute, or—if you explicitly allow me to run it here and provide credentials—I will run a single non-interactive mysql command from this shell to execute that statement and return results. 2) You run the SQL yourself: - Provide the exact question or the schema/table names and I will produce exactly one SQL statement (Action: Operation with a single fenced SQL block). You will run it against your database and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze and continue. 3) Create a local database inside the container: - If you want a local DB, say so and confirm. I will: (a) install a server package (mariadb-server or mysql-server) (b) initialize/start the server, (c) create a test database/user if needed, and (d) run queries. Note this will modify the container (installation and service start). If you choose this, I will outline exact commands and proceed only after your confirmation. Security notes: - If you provide a password to be used in a command line, I recommend quoting it as -p'PASSWORD' to avoid shell parsing issues or using ~/.my.cnf to avoid exposing it on the command line. - I will follow your rule of issuing exactly one SQL statement per operation round and will format SQL exactly as you required when performing an operation. Next step: tell me which option you choose and provide either (A) connection details and the question, (B) the exact question so I can emit SQL for you to run, or (C) confirm you want a local DB and which server (mariadb-server or mysql-server) to install.",
