  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04. The MySQL client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running: /var/lib/mysql and /var/run/mysqld do not exist, no mysqld process was found, and no socket is present. There are also no environment variables or client config files with credentials. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL yet because I have no database endpoint or credentials to connect to.",
  "plan": "I will not run any more system commands until you provide the database connection details and the SQL question you want answered. Please provide: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate no password / .my.cnf), database name (if applicable), and the exact question or the table/column conditions you want queried. Once you provide those, I will: 1) construct a single-line SQL statement (as required) and present it in the exact format you requested: start with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL statement in a fenced code block. 2) You will run the SQL; after you return the result, I will analyze it, possibly issue another single SQL operation (if needed) or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the final answers. If you prefer I can also give you the exact mysql client command to run from this shell once you provide credentials, for example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\" (this runs a single SQL statement non-interactively). Note about security: if the password contains special characters, quoting as -p'PASSWORD' or using a .my.cnf is safer.",
