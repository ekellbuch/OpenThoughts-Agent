  "analysis": "You have a working mysql client installed in the container (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket), and there are no credentials or environment variables available to connect to a remote server. Because of that I cannot execute any SQL statements yet. I also do not have the natural-language question or the target table/schema names to construct a query.",
  "plan": "I need two things from you before I can proceed: (A) the exact question you want answered (either natural-language or specifying table(s)/columns/filters), and (B) database connection information so I can form a runnable command or SQL. Provide one of these options: 1) Remote connection details (host, port if not 3306, username, password or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf, and database name). If you give these, I can either:   - produce a single-line SQL statement in the exact format you required (Action: Operation with a single SQL fenced code block), which you will run and return results; or   - give an exact mysql client command to run here non-interactively (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\"). 2) If you prefer to run queries yourself, provide the SQL question and I will produce the single-line SQL statement in the required format for you to execute and return the MySQL output. Additional notes: - I will only output SQL in the required pattern when you ask me to perform an operation. - If you provide credentials here and want me to run the query directly from this shell, I will include the mysql client invocation (single command) in the commands array. - If your password contains special characters, quote it as -p'PASSWORD' or use a ~/.my.cnf file to avoid shell quoting issues.",
