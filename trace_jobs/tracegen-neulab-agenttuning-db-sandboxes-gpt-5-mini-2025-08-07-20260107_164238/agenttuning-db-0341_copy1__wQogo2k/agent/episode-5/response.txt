  "analysis": "The container now has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0), but there is no local MySQL server or socket present and there are no credentials/configuration files with connection info. Therefore I cannot run any SQL yet because I don't have a reachable database endpoint or credentials. You must either provide connection details for a remote server or indicate you'll run the SQL I produce against your database and return the results.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide: 1) the exact SQL question you want answered (what table(s), columns, filters, or the natural-language question), and 2) connection details so I can form the proper SQL or client command. Required connection info: host (or socket), port (default 3306), username, password (or say no password / .my.cnf will be used), and database name (if applicable). Once you provide that, I will: - Build a single-line SQL statement and present it in the exact format you required (start with \"Action: Operation\" and a single SQL statement in a markdown code block). - You will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me. - I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the final answer array. If you want to run the SQL here directly, give me credentials and I will also provide the exact mysql client invocation to run the statement non-interactively (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\").",
