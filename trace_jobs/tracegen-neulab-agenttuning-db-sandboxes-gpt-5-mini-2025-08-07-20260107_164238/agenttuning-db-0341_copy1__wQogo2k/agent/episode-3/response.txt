  "analysis": "The mysql client has now been installed (mysql --version shows MySQL 8.0). There is still no evidence of a local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql earlier), so likely any database to query is remote. I need connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or a local socket path to actually run SQL. Before asking you for credentials and the question, I'll check for a local UNIX socket, any client config files that might contain default credentials (/etc/mysql/my.cnf or /root/.my.cnf), and any environment variables that expose DB connection info.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a MySQL UNIX socket at /var/run/mysqld and list that directory. 2) Test explicitly whether /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock is a socket. 3) Print /etc/mysql/my.cnf (the client fallback may be present) to look for [client] credentials or default socket settings. 4) Show any environment variables that mention mysql or mariadb. Based on these outputs I'll ask you for the SQL question and the connection details (or proceed to run your single-line SQL statement if a usable connection is found).",
