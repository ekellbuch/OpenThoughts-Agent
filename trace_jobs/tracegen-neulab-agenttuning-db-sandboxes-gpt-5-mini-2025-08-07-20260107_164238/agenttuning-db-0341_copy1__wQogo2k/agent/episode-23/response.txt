  "analysis": "You are in an Ubuntu 24.04 container where the mysql client (mysql 8.0) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process) and I found no credentials or environment variables exposing a remote database. You also have not supplied the natural-language question or the schema/table names to query. With no reachable database endpoint and no question, I cannot run any SQL or return data.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me how you want to proceed. Choose one of these options and provide the requested details so I can produce the next operation (remember: I will issue exactly one SQL statement per operation in the required format when you ask me to operate):\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf / no password), and database name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question to answer (natural-language or specify table(s)/columns/filters).\n- Tell me whether you want me to run the query here (you must explicitly allow it and provide credentials) or whether you will run the SQL I produce and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nIf you allow me to run it here and provide credentials, I will put a single non-interactive mysql client command into the commands array to execute exactly one SQL statement (example template I would use: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<ONE_SQL_STATEMENT>;\" — note: passwords with special characters should be single-quoted or placed in ~/.my.cnf).\n\nOption B — You run SQL yourself:\n- Provide the exact question (or table/schema/filters) and I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement formatted as you required: I will output \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL statement inside a fenced code block. You will execute only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output to me.\n\nOption C — Install a local database in this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server and which package to install (mariadb-server or mysql-server). If you confirm, I will outline the exact install/initialization commands and proceed only after your confirmation. Note this will modify the container (install packages and start services).\n\nNext step: reply with ONE of the options above and provide the required details (connection info + question, or confirm local DB install). Once you do, I will produce the next-step output following your rules (either the single-line SQL in the required format for you to run, or the single non-interactive command to run it here).",
