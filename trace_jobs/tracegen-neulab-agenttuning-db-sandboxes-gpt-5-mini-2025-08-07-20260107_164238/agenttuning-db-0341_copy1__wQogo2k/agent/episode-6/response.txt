  "analysis": "I have a working mysql client (mysql 8.0) installed in the container, but there is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and there are no credentials or environment variables present to connect to a remote server. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL yet because I lack a reachable database endpoint and credentials. You have not provided the SQL question to answer.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the database connection details and the exact question you want answered. Required connection info: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf), and database name (if applicable). Also tell me the natural-language question or which table(s)/columns/conditions to query. Once you provide those, I will construct a single-line SQL statement and present it in the exact format you requested (start with \"Action: Operation\" and a single SQL statement enclosed in a markdown code fence). You will execute that SQL and return the MySQL output; I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL operation or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the final answer array.",
