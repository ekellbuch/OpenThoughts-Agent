  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside the container. No MySQL-related commands have been run yet. The terminal shows the usual \"cannot set terminal process group\" banner from the container environment. There is currently no information about a MySQL server or client, credentials, or databases. Before you can run SQL statements I need to confirm whether a MySQL/MariaDB server is running in this container, whether the mysql client is available, and where socket/credential files (like /var/lib/mysql or /root/.my.cnf) are located. Once I know how to connect (unix socket, TCP host:port, and credentials) I can issue the single-line SQL statement you require in the specified format.",
  "plan": "1) Check if the mysql client binary is present and its version. 2) See if a mysqld (MySQL/MariaDB) server process is running. 3) Inspect typical data/config locations (/var/lib/mysql, /etc/mysql, /etc/my.cnf) and check for a root client config at /root/.my.cnf which could contain credentials. 4) Check listening TCP ports to see if a MySQL server is bound to 3306. Based on these outputs I'll determine how to connect and will ask you for the SQL question or proceed to run the SQL you give me. Commands will be short, non-interactive checks.",
