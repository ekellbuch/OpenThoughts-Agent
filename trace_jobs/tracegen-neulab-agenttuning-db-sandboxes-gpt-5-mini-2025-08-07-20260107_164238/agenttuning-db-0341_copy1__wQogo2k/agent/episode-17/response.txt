  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0) but there is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and no mysqld process. There are no environment variables or client config files discovered that contain connection credentials. You have not provided the natural-language question nor any database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Because of that I cannot execute any SQL or retrieve data yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide two things so I can proceed: 1) The exact question you want answered (natural-language or specify which table(s), columns and filters to query). 2) Database connection details so I can run queries or produce the SQL for you to execute: - host (or unix socket path) - port (default 3306 if omitted) - username - password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or that no password is required) - database name (if applicable) Also tell me which mode you prefer: A) I run the query here (if so, provide credentials and I will include a single non-interactive mysql client command that executes exactly one SQL statement), or B) You will run the SQL yourself (if so I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single-line SQL statement in a fenced code block). Optional alternative: if you want a local DB inside the container, say so and I can install and initialize a local MariaDB/MySQL server (I will outline required steps and ask for confirmation first). Once you provide the question and connection method, I will produce the single-line SQL operation per your rules.",
