  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and there are no credentials or environment variables present to connect to a remote database. You have not provided the natural-language question or any database connection details. Therefore I cannot execute any SQL or retrieve data yet.",
  "plan": "I need two things from you to proceed: (1) the exact question you want answered (natural-language, or specify table(s), columns and conditions), and (2) database connection details so I can either run queries from this shell or produce the single-line SQL for you to execute. Required connection info: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf / prompt), and database name (if applicable). Tell me whether you want me to: A) run the query here (in which case provide credentials and I will include a single non-interactive mysql client command to execute exactly one SQL statement), or B) only produce the SQL (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single-line SQL statement in a fenced code block). Example mysql client invocation I can use here (replace placeholders): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\". Note: if your password has special characters, use single quotes or ~/.my.cnf to avoid shell quoting issues. Once you provide the question and connection details (or confirm you'll run the SQL), I will produce the single-line SQL operation as required.",
