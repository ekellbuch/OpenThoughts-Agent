  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed in the container (mysql 8.0), but there is no local MySQL server or socket present and no connection credentials. Because of that I cannot run any SQL yet. I also haven't received the natural-language question or the schema/table names to query. To proceed I need a reachable database endpoint and the question to answer.",
  "plan": "Provide clear next steps so we can operate safely and follow the rule of issuing exactly one SQL statement per operation round: 1) You provide the database connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate you prefer to be prompted / use ~/.my.cnf), and database name (if applicable). 2) Provide the exact question you want answered or the table(s)/columns/filters to query. 3) I will construct a single-line SQL statement and present it in the required format (starting with \"Action: Operation\" and containing a single SQL statement in a fenced code block). You will run that statement and return the raw MySQL output. 4) I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the final answer array. If you want to run the SQL from this shell directly, you can run a non-interactive mysql client command I provide. Example (replace placeholders): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\"  (If you prefer not to put the password on the command line, omit the password after -p to be prompted.) Note: I will only produce SQL in the exact required format when you ask me to perform an operation.",
