  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and there are no credentials or environment variables available to connect to a remote server. I have not been given the natural-language question or the database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Because of that I cannot run any SQL or retrieve data yet.",
  "plan": "I need two things from you to proceed: (1) the exact question you want answered (either a natural-language question or a description of the table(s)/columns/filters to query), and (2) database connection details so I can either run the query from this shell or produce the single-line SQL you must execute. Please provide: - host (or unix socket path) - port (default 3306 if omitted) - username - password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or that no password is required) - database name (if applicable) Also tell me whether you want me to: A) run the query here (in which case provide credentials and I will include one mysql client command to execute exactly one SQL statement), or B) just produce the SQL (I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format: start with \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement in a fenced code block). Examples I can produce once you give the question: - Non-interactive mysql client command to run here (replace placeholders): mysql -h HOST -P 3306 -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\" - Single-operation SQL output (what you requested): Action: Operation ```sql SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition; ``` I will not emit any SQL until you explicitly request the operation and provide either the connection details or confirm you will run the SQL yourself and return results.",
