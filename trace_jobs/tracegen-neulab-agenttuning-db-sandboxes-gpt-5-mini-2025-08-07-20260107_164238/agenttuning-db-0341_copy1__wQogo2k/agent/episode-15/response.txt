You have not supplied the natural-language question or any database connection details. Without a reachable database endpoint and the question/schema info I cannot run SQL or retrieve data.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you provide the required information. Please supply: 1) The exact question you want answered (either natural-language or specify the table(s), columns, and filters). 2) Database connection details so I can run the query or produce the single-line SQL for you to execute. Required connection info: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or that no password is required), and database name (if applicable). Also tell me whether you want me to: A) run the query from this shell (in which case provide credentials and I will include a single non-interactive mysql client command in the commands array that executes exactly one SQL statement), or B) only produce the SQL statement (I will output exactly one SQL statement, formatted per your rules: start with \"Action: Operation\" followed by one SQL statement enclosed in a fenced code block). If you want to run the SQL here yourself, I will provide the exact mysql client command to run (example below). If you provide credentials and want me to run it here, I will execute one statement non-interactively and then wait for the resulting output to analyze further.",
