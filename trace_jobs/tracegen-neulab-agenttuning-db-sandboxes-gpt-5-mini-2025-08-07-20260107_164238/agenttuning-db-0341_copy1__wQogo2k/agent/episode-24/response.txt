  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the MySQL client (mysql 8.0) is installed and functional. There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process), and I found no credentials or environment variables pointing to a remote DB. You have not provided the natural-language question or any database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Therefore I cannot execute any SQL or return query results at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose how to proceed and provide the necessary information. Pick one option and give the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote database (recommended):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf / no password), and database name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (natural-language or specify table(s)/columns/filters).\n- Indicate whether you want me to run the query here (you must explicitly allow this and supply credentials) or whether you will run the SQL I produce and return the output.\n\nOption B — You will run SQL yourself:\n- Provide the exact question (or schema/table/filters). I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement formatted per your rules (see below) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption C — Create a local DB inside the container:\n- Confirm you want a local MySQL/MariaDB server installed and state which package to use (mariadb-server or mysql-server). If confirmed, I will outline and (only after your confirmation) run the install/init steps. Note this modifies the container by installing packages and starting a service.\n\nImportant formatting rules I will follow when performing an operation:\n- If you ask me to operate, I will output: Action: Operation\n  followed by a single SQL statement inside a single fenced code block. The SQL will be one line only. You will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output.\n- If you permit me to run the query here and provide credentials, I will use a single non-interactive mysql client command such as:\n  mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"<ONE_SQL_STATEMENT>;\"\n  (quote the password with single quotes to avoid shell interpolation issues, or use ~/.my.cnf to avoid passing the password on the command line.)\n\nProvide which option you choose and the required details (connection info + exact question, or confirmation to install local DB). Once I have that I will produce the next-step output (either the single-line SQL in the required format for you to run, or the single non-interactive command to run it here).",
