  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket), no mysqld process, and no credentials or environment variables exposing a remote database. You have not provided the natural-language question or any connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Therefore I cannot execute any SQL or retrieve data at this time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide two things so I can proceed: (1) The exact question you want answered (either a natural-language question or the specific table(s)/columns/filters to query). (2) Database connection details so I can run a query from this shell or produce the single-line SQL for you to execute. Required connection info: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or that no password is required), and database name (if applicable). Options you can choose: - I run the query here: provide credentials and I will include one non-interactive mysql client command that executes exactly one SQL statement and return the raw output for analysis. Example (replace placeholders): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\" (note: quote the password with single quotes to avoid shell issues). - You run the SQL yourself: give me the question and I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single SQL statement in a fenced code block). Important: I will only emit SQL when you explicitly request an operation; each operation will contain exactly one SQL statement per your rules. Please provide the question and connection method you prefer (I run it here, or you run the SQL and return results).",
