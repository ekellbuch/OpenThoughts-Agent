  "analysis": "You are in a container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process were found). I also could not find any client credentials or environment variables providing connection info. You have not provided the natural‑language question or the schema/table names to query, nor any database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Because of that, no SQL can be executed yet from this environment.",
  "plan": "I will not run further commands until you tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of these options and give the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote database (recommended if you already have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf), and database name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (either natural-language or specify table(s)/columns/filters).\n- If you want me to run the query here, explicitly allow it and provide credentials; I will run exactly one non-interactive mysql client command that executes a single SQL statement. If you prefer to run the SQL yourself, I'll produce a single-line SQL statement in the exact format you requested (Action: Operation + one fenced SQL block) for you to run and return the output.\n\nOption B — You run SQL against your DB yourself:\n- Provide the exact question or table/schema description and I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation + one fenced SQL block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption C — Create a local DB inside this container:\n- Confirm you want a local server and which package to install (mariadb-server or mysql-server). I will then: (1) install the server, (2) initialize/start it, (3) create a database/user if desired, and (4) run queries. Note this modifies the container (installs packages and starts a service).\n\nSecurity notes:\n- If you provide a password to use in a one-shot mysql CLI command, quote it with single quotes (e.g. -p'PASSWORD') to avoid shell interpolation issues, or prefer to use ~/.my.cnf to avoid putting the password on the command line.\n- I will adhere to your rule of issuing exactly one SQL statement per operation and will format SQL exactly as you required when performing an operation.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details (connection info + question, or confirm local DB installation).",
