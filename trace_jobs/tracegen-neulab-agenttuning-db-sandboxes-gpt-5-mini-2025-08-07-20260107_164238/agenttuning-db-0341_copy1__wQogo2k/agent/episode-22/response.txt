  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and the mysql client (mysql 8.0) is installed and working. There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, no mysqld process), and I could not find any credentials or environment variables exposing a remote database. You have not supplied a natural-language question or any database connection details (host/socket, port, username, password, database). Therefore I cannot execute any SQL against a database yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me how to proceed. Please choose one of the following options and provide the requested details:\n\nOption A — Query an existing remote database (recommended if you already have one):\n- Provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf / no password), and database name (if applicable).\n- Provide the exact question you want answered (either natural-language or specify table(s)/columns/filters).\n- Indicate whether you want me to run the query here (you must explicitly allow this and provide credentials) or whether you will run the SQL yourself and return the output.\n\nIf you permit me to run the query here, I will place a single non-interactive mysql client command in the commands array that executes exactly one SQL statement (example template I will use: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\" ).\n\nOption B — You run SQL yourself:\n- Provide the exact question (or table/schema/filters). I will produce exactly one single-line SQL statement and format it per your rules: I will output \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single SQL statement inside a fenced code block (one line). You will run only that SQL and return the raw MySQL output.\n\nOption C — Create a local DB inside the container:\n- Confirm you want a local MySQL/MariaDB server installed and indicate the package you prefer (mariadb-server or mysql-server). If you confirm, I will: (1) install the server, (2) initialize/start it, and (3) create database/user as needed before running queries. Note this modifies the container (installs packages and starts services).\n\nSecurity note: If you provide a password to use on the command line, quote it with single quotes (e.g. -p'PASSWORD') to reduce shell interpolation issues, or prefer providing credentials via ~/.my.cnf to avoid exposing the password on the command line.\n\nAfter you choose and provide the required details (connection info + question, or confirm you will run my SQL, or confirm local DB install), I will produce the next-step output following your rule of issuing exactly one SQL statement per operation.",
