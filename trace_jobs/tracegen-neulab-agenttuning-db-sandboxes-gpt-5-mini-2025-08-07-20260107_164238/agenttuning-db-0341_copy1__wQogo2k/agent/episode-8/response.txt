I cannot run any SQL because I do not have a reachable database endpoint (no socket, no host:port, no username/password, no database name) nor have you given the natural-language question or table/schema to query.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you provide the necessary information. To proceed, please provide: 1) The exact question you want answered (natural-language or which table/columns/filters). 2) The connection details so I can form the SQL or the client invocation: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or specify use of ~/.my.cnf), and database name (if applicable). Once you provide these, I will: - Construct a single-line SQL statement and present it in the required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include exactly one SQL statement in a fenced code block). - You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output. - I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or finish with \"Action: Answer\" and the final answer array. If you prefer to run the SQL here yourself, tell me and I will give the exact mysql client command to execute the single SQL statement non-interactively (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\").",
