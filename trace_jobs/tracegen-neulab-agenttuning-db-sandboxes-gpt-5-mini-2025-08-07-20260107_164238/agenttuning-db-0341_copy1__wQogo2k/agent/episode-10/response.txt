You have not provided the natural-language question or table/schema details to query. Without a reachable database endpoint (host/socket, port, username, password, database) I cannot run any SQL.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide two things so I can proceed: (1) the exact question you want answered (natural-language description or the table(s)/columns/filters to query), and (2) the database connection details so I can either run the query from this shell or provide the single-line SQL you must execute. Required connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or no password), and database name (if applicable). Options for continuing: - If you want me to run the query here, provide credentials and I will include the mysql client command in the commands array that performs the single SQL statement non-interactively. - If you prefer to run the SQL yourself, provide the question and I will output a single-line SQL statement in the exact required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include exactly one SQL statement in a fenced code block). Note: I will not emit any SQL until you explicitly request an operation or provide the connection info.",
