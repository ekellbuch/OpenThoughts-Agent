  "analysis": "From the latest terminal output: the mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found), there is no mysqld/mariadb process running, /var/lib/mysql does not exist, and ss is not available to check listening ports. In short, there is no local MySQL server or client available in this container. To run SQL statements from this environment we first need a client (or a reachable MySQL server elsewhere and its connection details). I will detect the OS and available package manager so we can decide how to install a client (or take other steps).",
  "plan": "1) Inspect /etc/os-release to identify the OS. 2) Check for available package managers (apt-get, yum, apk). With that information I (or you) can decide whether to install a MySQL/MariaDB client here or instead connect to a remote DB (if you provide host/credentials). I'll run simple, non-destructive detection commands and then wait for their outputs before attempting installation or further steps.",
