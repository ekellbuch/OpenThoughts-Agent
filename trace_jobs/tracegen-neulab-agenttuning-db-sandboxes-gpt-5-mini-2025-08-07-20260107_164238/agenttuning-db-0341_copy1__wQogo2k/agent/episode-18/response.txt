  "analysis": "You have a working mysql client installed in the container (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL/MariaDB server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and no mysqld process), and there are no environment variables or config files containing credentials. Because there is no reachable database endpoint and you have not supplied a natural-language question or schema details, I cannot execute any SQL yet.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me how you want to proceed. There are two main options: 1) Query a remote database you provide: - You provide connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (default 3306 if omitted), username, password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or that no password is required), and database name (if applicable). - You also provide the exact question (natural language or specify table/columns/filters). Then I will produce a single-line SQL statement formatted exactly as you requested (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include exactly one SQL statement in a fenced code block). You will run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, and I will analyze and continue as needed. Optionally, if you trust me to run the query here, provide credentials and I will include a single non-interactive mysql client command to run the SQL here: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\" 2) Create a local database in the container: - If you want a local DB, I can install and initialize a server (for example mariadb-server or mysql-server). Typical steps (I will not run these unless you confirm): apt-get update; apt-get install -y mariadb-server; initialize/start the server (container-specific: e.g., /etc/init.d/mysql start or run mysqld_safe); then create user/database and run queries. After you choose, I will either: A) produce the single-line SQL statement (Action: Operation with one SQL block) for you to execute and return results, or B) run one non-interactive mysql client command here if you provide credentials and allow me to execute. Notes about format and process: - Per your rules, every operation I request will contain exactly one SQL statement in a single fenced code block; I will not include other SQL in that step. - When you run my SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either request another single SQL operation or finish with the exact \"Action: Answer\\nFinal Answer: [..]\" pattern when I'm confident of the final answer.",
