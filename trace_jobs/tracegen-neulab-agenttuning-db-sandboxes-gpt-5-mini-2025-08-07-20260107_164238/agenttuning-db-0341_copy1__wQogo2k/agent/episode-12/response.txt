  "analysis": "The container has the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no /var/lib/mysql, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and no credentials/configuration or environment variables exposing a remote database. You have not provided the natural-language question or the database connection details (host/socket, port, user, password, database). Therefore I cannot run any SQL or retrieve data yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the information needed to proceed. Please supply: 1) The exact question you want answered (natural-language or specify table(s)/columns/filters). 2) Database connection details so I can run queries or provide the single-line SQL for you to execute: - host (or unix socket path), - port (default 3306 if omitted), - username, - password (or indicate use of ~/.my.cnf or that no password is required), - database name (if applicable). Once you provide those, I will either: A) Construct a single-line SQL statement and present it in the exact required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include exactly one SQL statement in a fenced code block) for you to execute and return results; or B) If you want me to run it here and you provide credentials, I will include a single non-interactive mysql client command in the commands array (example: mysql -h HOST -P PORT -u USER -p'PASSWORD' -D DATABASE -e \"SELECT ...;\"). Note about security: if providing the password on the command line, quote it as -p'PASSWORD' to avoid shell parsing issues, or prefer a ~/.my.cnf file to avoid exposing the password on the command line.",
