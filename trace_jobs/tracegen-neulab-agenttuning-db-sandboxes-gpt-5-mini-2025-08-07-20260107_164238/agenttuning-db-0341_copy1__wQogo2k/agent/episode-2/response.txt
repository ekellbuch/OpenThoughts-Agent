  "analysis": "The container is Ubuntu 24.04 and has apt-get available. There is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found) and no local MySQL server present. To run SQL statements from this environment we need a MySQL client (or connection details for an external server). Installing the client is the minimal, non-destructive step so we can connect to a database when you provide credentials/host or if a local server is later started.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install the default MySQL client package (default-mysql-client) which provides the mysql command. 3) Verify the mysql client is installed by checking its version. After that I will ask you for the database connection details (host, port, user, password or socket) and the SQL question you want answered. Commands: apt-get update, apt-get install -y default-mysql-client, mysql --version.",
