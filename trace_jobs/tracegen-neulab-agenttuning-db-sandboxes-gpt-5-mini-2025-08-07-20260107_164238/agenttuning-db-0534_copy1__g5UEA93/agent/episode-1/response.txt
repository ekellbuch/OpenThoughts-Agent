  "analysis": "I inspected the container. Current working directory is /app and I'm root. There are no files in /app. There is no mysql client installed (mysql: command not found), no mysqld process running, /var/lib/mysql appears empty or absent, and no MySQL config at /etc/mysql/my.cnf. In short: there is no local MySQL server or client available in this environment right now. Nothing has been changed or created — only read-only inspection commands have been run.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the database question you want answered and how you want me to access the database. You have three options:\n\n1) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host, port, username, password (or a socket/credentials file). If you provide connection info I will produce the exact SQL operation to run (one single SQL statement in the required format) and explain my reasoning.\n\n2) Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server inside this container so we can create/load data and run queries here. If you want that, I will run these commands in order to install and start MariaDB, create a test database/user (or you can provide desired DB/user), and then execute the SQL you request. Example commands I would run (if you authorize):\n   - apt-get update\n   - apt-get install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client\n   - service mysql start  (or /etc/init.d/mysql start)\n   - mysql -u root -e \"CREATE DATABASE ...;\"  (and other setup)\n\n3) If you already have an SQL statement you want executed against a given database elsewhere, paste the statement or the remote connection details and I will produce the single-line SQL statement (as required) in the \"Action: Operation\" form for you to execute. I will also explain my reasoning and next steps.\n\nTell me which option you choose and give any required details (the SQL question to answer or remote credentials, or approve installing a local server). After that I will either:\n- produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you specified (Action: Operation plus one-line SQL in a fenced code block), or\n- proceed to install and start MariaDB here and then run the SQL you request.\n\nI will not run any destructive commands until you authorize a specific plan.",
