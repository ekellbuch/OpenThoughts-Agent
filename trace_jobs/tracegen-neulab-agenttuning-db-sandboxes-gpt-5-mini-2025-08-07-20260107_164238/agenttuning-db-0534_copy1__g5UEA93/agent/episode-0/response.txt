  "analysis": "You are in a root shell inside /app. The terminal shows no prior commands run in this session. There is no user question yet about the MySQL database provided in the prompt. Before I can run SQL against a MySQL server, I need to discover whether MySQL is available in this environment, whether a server is running, and where database files or credentials might be. Currently nothing has been accomplished toward that discovery.",
  "plan": "I will run a small sequence of safe inspection commands to detect MySQL availability and any local database files or configuration. Specifically:\n- Print current working directory and user to confirm environment.\n- List files in the current directory so we can locate any project files or SQL scripts.\n- Check for running mysqld processes so we know if a server is running in this container.\n- Check mysql client availability and its version.\n- Check whether port 3306 is listening (common MySQL port).\n- Inspect common data directory (/var/lib/mysql) and MySQL config file to locate databases or credentials.\nThese commands are non-destructive and will inform the next steps (connect to MySQL, run SQL, or ask you for credentials/question).",
