The previous diagnostics showed: whoami=root, pwd=/app, an empty directory, no mysqld process, no mysql client found, nothing listening on port 3306, no /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and no MySQL-related environment variables. Nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to a MySQL server yet. To run SQL against a MySQL server from this environment we first need a client (or a running server).",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL client so we can issue SQL statements from this shell. I will: (1) update apt package lists, (2) install the default MySQL client package, (3) verify the mysql client is now available. After that, you can provide the question or database connection details and I'll prepare the single-line SQL to run according to your interactive protocol.",
