  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt inside a container (root@e450160d22dd:/app#). No MySQL commands have been run yet and there is no visible database output. We need to discover whether a MySQL server is running in the environment, whether the mysql client is available, and what credentials/config files (if any) are present. After that, we'll be ready to run the specific SQL you request. Currently nothing has been accomplished toward connecting to or querying a MySQL database.",
  "plan": "I'll run a few quick diagnostic commands to determine: (1) which user and directory I'm in, (2) whether a mysqld process is running, (3) whether the mysql client is installed and its version, (4) whether anything is listening on the MySQL default port 3306, (5) if common MySQL config files or environment variables exist that might provide connection info. Based on those outputs we can decide how to connect (local socket, TCP, credentials). I will run each command one at a time and inspect results before proceeding to actual SQL operations.",
