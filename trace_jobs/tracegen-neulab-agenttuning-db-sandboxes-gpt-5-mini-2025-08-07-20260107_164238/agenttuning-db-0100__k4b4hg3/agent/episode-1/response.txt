No commands have been run in this session beyond starting the shell, and there is no MySQL output or question provided yet. I cannot see any database state or credentials from the terminal output. Nothing has been accomplished toward querying a MySQL server.",
  "plan": "I will first check whether the mysql client exists on this container and whether a MySQL server process or socket looks present. Those checks do not require credentials and will tell us whether we can connect locally. After that I will ask you to provide the question you want answered and the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database). Once you provide the question and credentials I will: 1) connect using the mysql client (or request you to run the connection command if remote credentials are sensitive), 2) list databases and tables as needed (SHOW DATABASES; USE db; SHOW TABLES;), and 3) run a single SQL statement per round in the required format (Action: Operation then a single-line SQL code block). I will interpret the MySQL output you return and iterate until I can produce the final answer (Action: Answer with the exact required final output).",
