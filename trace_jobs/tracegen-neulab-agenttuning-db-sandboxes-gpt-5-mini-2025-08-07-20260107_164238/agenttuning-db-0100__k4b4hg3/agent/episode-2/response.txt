No database connectivity is possible yet from this environment. Nothing has been accomplished toward querying or inspecting a database.",
  "plan": "I will attempt to install a MySQL client so we can connect to a MySQL server if one is available (locally or remotely). Steps: 1) update apt package indexes. 2) install the default-mysql-client package. 3) verify the mysql client is available. 4) re-check for a local mysqld socket or process. After that, you can provide the database connection details (host, port, user, password, database) and the question to answer; I will then prepare a single SQL statement in the required format for you to run and return the output.",
