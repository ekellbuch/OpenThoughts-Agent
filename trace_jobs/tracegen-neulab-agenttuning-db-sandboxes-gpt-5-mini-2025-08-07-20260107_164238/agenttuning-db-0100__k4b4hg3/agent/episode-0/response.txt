There is no MySQL output available yet and you have not provided a question about the database or any database credentials. Nothing has been accomplished yet with respect to inspecting or querying a MySQL database.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL yet because you haven't provided the question or database connection info. To proceed I need either: (A) the question you want answered about the database plus credentials (host, port, user, password, database name) or (B) confirmation that a local MySQL socket/user is available and the credentials to use. Once you provide that, I will: 1) check for the mysql client and connectivity (commands: which mysql, mysql --version). 2) connect to the server (mysql -uUSER -p -hHOST -PPORT DATABASE) so I can run SQL. 3) list databases and tables as needed (SHOW DATABASES; USE db; SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE table;). 4) run the single SQL statement you want per round; I will provide it formatted exactly as requested (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). 5) interpret the MySQL output you return and either run further operations or produce the final answer (Action: Answer with the exact required final output).",
