  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I manually started mysqld and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root via that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The installer left the root account without a password (insecure). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet specified the question you want answered from the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will do one of two things:\n\n- Operate: I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with the literal line: Action: Operation, then a single SQL code block in markdown with a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me. After you return that output I will analyze it and either produce a final answer or provide another single SQL operation.\n\n- Answer: If no further SQL execution is needed, I will return the final answer using the required literal pattern: Action: Answer followed by Final Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nHelpful notes for formulating your question:\n- To run SQL from this shell use the socket and root account: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SQL\"\n- Example queries I can run (pick one or provide a custom question):\n  - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n  - Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n  - Show rows with a filter: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n  - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n  - Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nTell me exactly which query you want (include database and table names and any conditions). Once you do, I will present the single SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
