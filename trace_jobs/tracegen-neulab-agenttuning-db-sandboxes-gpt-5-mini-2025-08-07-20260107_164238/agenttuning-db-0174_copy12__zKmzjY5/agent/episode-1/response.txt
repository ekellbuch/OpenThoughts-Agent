  "analysis": "Current shell shows there is no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found). There is no MySQL/MariaDB server running (no mysqld/mariadbd processes) and no socket at /var/run/mysqld. Nothing has been done yet to connect to a database. To run SQL against a MySQL-compatible server I need a client and a running server. The container currently lacks the client binary and likely lacks a running server, so I must install the client (and if necessary the server) and start the server before issuing SQL statements.",
  "plan": "1) Update package lists so we can install packages. 2) Install a MySQL/MariaDB client and server packages (use the system defaults) so the mysql client tool is available and a server can run locally. 3) Start the MySQL service. 4) Attempt a connection as root with no password and run SHOW DATABASES; to list available databases. Each step will reveal whether we can proceed; if the server fails to start or authentication is required we'll adjust next steps.",
