  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I manually started mysqld and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root over that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The installer left the root account without a password (insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet provided a specific question about the database contents.",

Please specify the database and table names and any filter conditions, or choose one of these example requests:\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\nWhen you provide the question I will either:\n- Operate: output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block containing the SQL). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is necessary, I will return the final answer using the exact required pattern (the literal line \"Action: Answer\" and then \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\\\"]\").\nNote: to run any SQL I give from this shell use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" (root currently has no password).",
