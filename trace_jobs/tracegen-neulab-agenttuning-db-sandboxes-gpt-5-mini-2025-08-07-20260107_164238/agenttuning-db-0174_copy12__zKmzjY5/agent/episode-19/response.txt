  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I manually started mysqld and verified it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root via that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The MySQL root account currently has no password (installer used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided a specific question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, show mysql users, modify data, etc.). When you provide the question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: If no DB operation is required, I will return the final answer using the exact required pattern (the literal line \"Action: Answer\" then \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\\\"]\").\n\nExamples of queries you can request now (tell me which, or give a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a filter: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nNote: to run any SQL in this environment use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" (root currently has no password).",
