  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually; the server is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and TCP port 3306. I verified connectivity: SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The installer left the root account without a password (the logs warned about an insecure initialization). No application-specific database queries have been run because you haven't specified a question yet.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to give the exact database question you want answered. When you provide the question I will do one of two things: (A) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will then analyze that output and continue as needed. OR (B) Answer — if no DB operation is required, I will provide the final answer using the required \"Action: Answer\" pattern. Before you ask, here are common example queries I can run (pick one or provide a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\nNotes on execution: to run SQL from this shell use the socket and root account: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SQL\". I will only provide one SQL statement per operation step as you required.",
