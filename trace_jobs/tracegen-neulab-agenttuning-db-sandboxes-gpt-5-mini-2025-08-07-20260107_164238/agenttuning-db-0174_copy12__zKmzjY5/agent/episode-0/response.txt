  "analysis": "You are in a root shell at /app with no current MySQL activity shown. Nothing has been done yet toward answering a database question. To proceed I need to locate the MySQL/MariaDB client and server and then connect so I can run SQL queries. I will first detect whether a mysql client is present and whether a server process or socket is available. Then I'll attempt a simple connection and list databases so we know what schemas/tables are available. Depending on the output, we'll choose the next SQL to run.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a mysql client binary (mysql --version). 2) Check running processes for mysqld/mariadbd to see if a server is running. 3) Check for a MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld). 4) Attempt a noninteractive connection as root (no password) to list databases (SHOW DATABASES;) so we can see what databases are present. Based on that output we'll pick the next SQL to run. The mysql client command will produce the database listing or an authentication error which will guide further steps.",
