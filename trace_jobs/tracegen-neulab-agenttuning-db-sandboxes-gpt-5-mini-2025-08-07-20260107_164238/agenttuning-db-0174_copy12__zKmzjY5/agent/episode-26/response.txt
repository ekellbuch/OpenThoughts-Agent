  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I manually started mysqld and verified it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). A connection as root over that socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The MySQL root account currently has no password (the installation used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided a specific question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered (include database name, table name(s), and any filter conditions). After you provide the question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will analyze the output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will return the final answer using the literal pattern: \"Action: Answer\" and \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\"]\".\n\nIf you’re unsure what to ask, examples you can request now (tell me which and I will produce the single SQL statement):\n- List tables in a database named X: SHOW TABLES FROM X;\n- Describe a table X.Y: SHOW COLUMNS FROM X.Y;\n- Show rows from X.Y with a condition: SELECT * FROM X.Y WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM X.Y;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nWhen you give the exact question, I will produce the single SQL statement (formatted per your rules) for you to execute.",
