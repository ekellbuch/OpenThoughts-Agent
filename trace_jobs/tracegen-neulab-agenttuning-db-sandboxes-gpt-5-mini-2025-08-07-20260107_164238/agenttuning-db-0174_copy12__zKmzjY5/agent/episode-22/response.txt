  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I manually started mysqld and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root over that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The MySQL root account currently has no password (installer used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet provided a specific question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with the literal line \"Action: Operation\" and then include a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will analyze the output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will return the final answer using the exact required pattern (the literal line \"Action: Answer\" followed by \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\\\"]\").\n\nBefore you ask, note how I will run SQL from this shell if you want me to operate: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" (root currently has no password). Examples you can request: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; SHOW COLUMNS FROM db.table; SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table; SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user; etc. Tell me exactly which query (include database/table names and any conditions) and whether I should Operate now.",
