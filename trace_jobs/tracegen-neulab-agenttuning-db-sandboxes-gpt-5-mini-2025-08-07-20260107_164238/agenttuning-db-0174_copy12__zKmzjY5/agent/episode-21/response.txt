  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root over that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The MySQL root account currently has no password (the installer left it insecure). No application-specific database queries have been executed because you have not provided a specific question about the data yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, show mysql users, modify data, etc.). When you give the question I will choose one of two actions:\n- Operate: I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format, starting with the literal line \"Action: Operation\" and then a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: If no DB operation is required, I will provide the final answer using the literal pattern \"Action: Answer\" followed by \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\\\"]\".\n\nBefore you ask, note how to run the SQL I will provide from this shell (root with no password):\nmysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nIf you are unsure what to request, here are common options you can pick or adapt:\n- List tables in a database named X: SHOW TABLES FROM X;\n- Describe a table X.Y: SHOW COLUMNS FROM X.Y;\n- Show rows from X.Y with a condition: SELECT * FROM X.Y WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows in X.Y: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM X.Y;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nTell me exactly which query you want (include database and table names and any conditions). Once you do, I will produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
