  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and confirmed it is accepting connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I verified connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; as root over the socket; it returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The root account currently has no password (the installation used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been run because you have not yet provided a specific question about the data.",
  "plan": "I'm waiting for you to state the exact database question or operation you want me to perform. When you provide the question I will choose one of two actions:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (starting with \"Action: Operation\" and followed by a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will then analyze the output and continue with further single-statement operations as needed.\n- Answer: if no further DB operations are required, I will provide the final answer using the required \"Action: Answer\" pattern.\nHelpful notes to help you formulate the request:\n- To run SQL from this shell use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SQL\" (root currently has no password).\n- Examples of useful next queries (tell me which one you want or give your own):\n  - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n  - Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n  - Show rows with a filter: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n  - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n  - Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\nPlease tell me exactly which question to answer (include database and table names and any conditions). Once you do, I will either (A) produce the single SQL statement to execute (Action: Operation) or (B) give the final answer (Action: Answer) if no SQL is needed.",
