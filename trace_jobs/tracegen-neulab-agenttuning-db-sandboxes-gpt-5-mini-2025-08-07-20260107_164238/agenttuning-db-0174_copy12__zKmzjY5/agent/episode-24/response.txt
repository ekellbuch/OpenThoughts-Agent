  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and verified it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). A connection as root over that socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The server is operational and the root account currently has no password (insecure). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided a database question yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me the exact database question you want answered (include database name, table name(s), and any filter/conditions). Once you give the question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will provide the final answer using the literal pattern \"Action: Answer\" and \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\"]\".\n\nIf you are unsure what to request, pick one of these examples and I will prepare the single SQL statement:\n- List tables in database 'your_db': SHOW TABLES FROM your_db;\n- Describe a table 'your_db.your_table': SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_db.your_table;\n- Show rows from a table with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_db.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_db.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nNote: to run the SQL I give from this shell use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" (root currently has no password).",
