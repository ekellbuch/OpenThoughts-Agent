I manually started mysqld and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root via that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The root account currently has no password (installer left it insecure). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet specified the question you want answered from the database.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the exact database question or operation to perform. When you give the question I will either:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, produce the final answer using the literal pattern \"Action: Answer\" and \"Final Answer: [...]\".\n\nBefore you ask, note:\n- To run SQL from this shell use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SQL\"\n- Example queries you can request: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database; SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table; SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table; SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nPlease tell me exactly which question you want answered (include database and table names and any conditions).",
