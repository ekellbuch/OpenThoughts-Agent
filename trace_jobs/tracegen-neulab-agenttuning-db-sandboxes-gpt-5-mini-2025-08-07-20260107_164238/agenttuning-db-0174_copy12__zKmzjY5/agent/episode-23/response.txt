  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and verified it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). A connection as root over that socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The installer left the root account without a password (insecure). No application-specific database queries have been executed because you have not yet specified a question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me exactly what question you want answered from the database (include database and table names and any filter conditions). Options you can request (pick one or provide a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nWhen you give the question I will either: 1) Operate — produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with the literal line: Action: Operation, then a single SQL code block in markdown containing a one-line SQL statement). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will analyze the output and continue as needed. OR 2) Answer — if no DB operation is needed I will produce the final answer with the exact literal pattern: Action: Answer followed by Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nNotes:\n- I will only produce one SQL statement per operation step, and it must be a single line inside the SQL code block as you required.\n- To run SQL from this shell yourself you can use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" (root currently has no password). \n\nTell me the exact query you want me to run (database and table names and any conditions) and whether I should Operate now.",
