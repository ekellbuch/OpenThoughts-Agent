  "analysis": "mysqld was successfully started manually (the installer previously reported \"mysqld is running as pid 1435\"). The mysql client command executed after that produced no visible output, so we don't yet know whether the server created the expected socket (/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock) or is accepting connections. The data directory /var/lib/mysql exists and looks initialized. The error log previously showed temporary sockets and shutdowns; we started mysqld with an explicit socket argument, so we should verify the running process, confirm the socket file, test that the server responds using mysqladmin, and then re-run SHOW DATABASES to list the databases.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm the running mysqld process and obtain its PID. 2) List the /var/run/mysqld directory to check for the socket file. 3) Show the process file descriptors for the mysqld PID to see which socket file it's using. 4) Use mysqladmin ping/version over the socket to verify the server is responding. 5) Run mysql -uroot over the socket and execute SHOW DATABASES; 6) If anything fails, tail the error log to see diagnostics. These commands will tell us whether the server is up and give the database list.",
