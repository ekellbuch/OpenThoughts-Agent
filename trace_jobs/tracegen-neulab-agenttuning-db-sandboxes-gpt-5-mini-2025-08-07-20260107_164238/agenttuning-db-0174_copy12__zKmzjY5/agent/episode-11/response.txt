  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and verified it is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and on port 3306. A SHOW DATABASES; executed as root over the socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL root account currently has no password (installer left it insecure). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet specified what you want to do with the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want (for example: list tables in a database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, show users, update/delete rows, etc.). Once you give the question I will choose one of two actions:\n- Operate: I will provide exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with \"Action: Operation\" and including one-line SQL in a SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: If no further DB operation is needed, I will provide the final answer in the required \"Action: Answer\" format.\nHelpful notes before you ask:\n- To run SQL I will use the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (mysql -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -uroot -e \"SQL\"), since the server accepts socket connections and root currently has no password.\n- Examples of SQL I can run next (you may pick one or specify your own):\n  - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n  - Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n  - Show rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition LIMIT 100;\n  - Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n  - Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\nTell me the exact question (database and table names and any conditions) and whether I should Operate now.",
