  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in this container. I manually started mysqld and confirmed it is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and port 3306. I connected as root via the socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The installer left the root account without a password (insecure). No application-specific database queries have been run because you have not provided a specific question to answer yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you provide it I will choose one of two actions:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will then parse that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no further DB operations are required, I will return the final answer using the exact required \"Action: Answer\" pattern.\nUseful examples you can request now (pick one or give a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\nTell me precisely which operation you want and I will produce the single SQL statement in the exact format you requested.",
