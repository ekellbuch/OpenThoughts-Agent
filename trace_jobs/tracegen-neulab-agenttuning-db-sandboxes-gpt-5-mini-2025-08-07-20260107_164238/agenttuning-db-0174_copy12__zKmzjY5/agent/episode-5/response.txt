  "analysis": "MySQL is now installed and running in the container. Summary of current state:\n- The mysql client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql). The server binary is /usr/sbin/mysqld.\n- I was able to start mysqld manually with --daemonize and an explicit socket. The running process is owned by user mysql (PID shown in the logs and ps output).\n- The server is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and on the MySQL X plugin port 33060 (bind-address 127.0.0.1). The error log confirms: \"ready for connections... socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' port: 3306\".\n- Connecting as root via the socket works without a password (this was flagged in the logs as an insecure initialization). A SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys.\n- The data directory /var/lib/mysql appears initialized and owned by mysql:mysql.\nWhat has been accomplished: installed MySQL server and client, started the server, and validated that the server accepts socket connections and lists databases.\nWhat still needs to be done: You have not yet provided the specific SQL question you want answered. To proceed I need your question (for example: list rows from a specific table, find a user, aggregate data, modify data, etc.). Once you give that, I will prepare a single SQL statement and the exact shell command to run it (or I can run it if you instruct me to operate). Note: the server currently has an empty root password (insecure). If you want persistent/secure configuration, we can set a root password and configure the server differently before running production queries.",
  "plan": "I will not run any further SQL until you specify the question you want answered. When you provide the question, I will:\n- Decide the single SQL statement needed to answer it.\n- Present the SQL in the exact format you requested when choosing to operate (i.e., the required \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a markdown sql code block). You will execute only the first SQL block I provide and return the raw MySQL output. After you provide that output I will parse it and either (a) provide the final answer (Action: Answer with Final Answer array) if sufficient, or (b) run another single SQL operation if more exploration is required.\nIf you'd like me to run a simple readiness query now (e.g., SHOW DATABASES; or SHOW TABLES FROM some_database; or SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;), tell me which one and I will produce the single SQL statement (in the required format) to execute. Example possible next operations:\n- List databases (already done). No need to run again.\n- List tables in a specific database: I would run SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Show users: I would run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Query a specific table for results: SELECT * FROM db.table WHERE ...;\nTell me which question you want answered and whether I should operate now.",
