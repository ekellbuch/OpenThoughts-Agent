  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and a mysqld process is running. I manually started mysqld with the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and verified connectivity: SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The MySQL root account currently appears to have no password (installer-initialized insecure). No application-specific databases or tables have been queried yet because you haven't asked a specific question about the data.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you tell me what you want (examples below), I will either: 1) Operate — output exactly one SQL statement wrapped in the required \"Action: Operation\" pattern and a single SQL code block (one-line SQL). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return its raw MySQL output to me, after which I will analyze the output and continue as needed; or 2) Answer — if no further DB operations are required, I will return the final answer using the required \"Action: Answer\" pattern.\n\nExamples of questions you can ask me to operate on now:\n- \"List tables in database X\" (I would run SHOW TABLES FROM X;)\n- \"Show rows from X.Y with condition Z\" (I would run SELECT * FROM X.Y WHERE Z LIMIT ...;)\n- \"Count rows in X.Y\" (I would run SELECT COUNT(*) FROM X.Y;)\n- \"Describe table X.Y\" (I would run SHOW COLUMNS FROM X.Y;)\n- \"Show mysql users\" (I would run SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;)\n\nNotes and recommendations before you ask:\n- The server accepts socket connections at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock; use -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock if needed.\n- Root currently has no password; if this is a persistent environment and you care about security, consider setting a root password before running production queries.\n\nTell me the exact question you want answered (which database/table and what condition). After you do, I will produce the single SQL statement to execute in the exact format you requested.",
