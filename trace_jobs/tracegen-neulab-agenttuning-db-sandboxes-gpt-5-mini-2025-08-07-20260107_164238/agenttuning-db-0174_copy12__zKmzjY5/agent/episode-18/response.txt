  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and verified it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I connected as root over that socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The root account currently has no password (insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet provided a specific question about the database contents.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a specific database, describe a table, query rows with a condition, count rows, show mysql users, modify data, etc.). Once you provide the question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line: Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL statement inside a SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me. I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will return the final answer using the required literal pattern: Action: Answer and Final Answer: [\"...\"]\n\nNotes to run SQL in this environment: use the socket and root account (currently no password):\nmysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\"\n\nTell me the exact database question (include database and table names and any filter conditions).",
