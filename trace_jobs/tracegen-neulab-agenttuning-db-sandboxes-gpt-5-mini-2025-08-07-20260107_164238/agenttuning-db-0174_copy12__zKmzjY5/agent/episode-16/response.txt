  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). Connecting as root over that socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The installer left the root account without a password (insecure). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not yet specified the question you want answered from the database.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. Once you provide the question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format starting with the literal line \"Action: Operation\" and then a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block. You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me; I will analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will return the final answer using the required literal pattern: \"Action: Answer\" followed by \"Final Answer: [\\\"ANSWER1\\\", ...]\".\n\nWhen you ask me to Operate, I will provide a single SQL statement. To run it in this environment you can use (example):\nmysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL statement>\"\n\nExample queries you can request now (pick one or give a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a filter: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nTell me exactly which query you want (include database and table names and any conditions).",
