  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually using the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and verified connectivity: SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The root account currently has no password (installer left it insecure). There are no application-specific SQL queries run yet because you have not provided a question about the database contents. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements via the mysql client using the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the exact question you want answered from the database. Tell me what you want to know or do (examples below). Once you provide the question I will either:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output to me. After you return that output I will analyze it and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will provide the final answer using the required Action: Answer pattern.\nExamples of questions you can ask now:\n- \"List tables in database dbname\" (I would run: SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;)\n- \"Describe table dbname.tbl\" (I would run: SHOW COLUMNS FROM dbname.tbl;)\n- \"Show rows from dbname.tbl where id=5\" (I would run: SELECT * FROM dbname.tbl WHERE id=5;)\n- \"Count rows in dbname.tbl\" (I would run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.tbl;)\n- \"Show users\" (I would run: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;)\nWhen you send the specific request, I will prepare the single SQL statement (and nothing else) for you to execute.",
