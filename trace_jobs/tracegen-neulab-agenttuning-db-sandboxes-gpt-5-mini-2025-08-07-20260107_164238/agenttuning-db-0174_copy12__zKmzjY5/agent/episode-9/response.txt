  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running inside the container. I started mysqld manually and confirmed it is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and on port 3306. I successfully connected as root over the socket and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The root account currently has no password (installer left it insecure). No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you haven't yet provided the specific question you want answered from the database.",
  "plan": "I'm waiting for the exact database question you want answered. When you provide it I will choose one of two actions:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (start with \"Action: Operation\" and include a single-line SQL statement in a markdown sql code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I give and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze that output and continue.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is needed, I will return the final answer using the required \"Action: Answer\" pattern.\nTo help you choose, examples of queries I can run next (pick one or give a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show rows with a condition: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE condition LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\nWhen you tell me which of the above (or provide a different question), I'll produce the single SQL statement in the exact required format so you can execute it and return the output.",
