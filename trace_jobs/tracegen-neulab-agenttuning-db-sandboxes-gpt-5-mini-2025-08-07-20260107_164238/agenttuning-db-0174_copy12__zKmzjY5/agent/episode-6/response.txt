  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. MySQL server and client were installed and a mysqld process was started manually. The server is running (owned by mysql) and is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). Connecting as root via that socket works and SHOW DATABASES; returned the default databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL root account currently has no password (the installer left it insecure). No further SQL has been run to answer a specific user question yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to give the specific question you want answered from the database (for example: list tables in a specific database, show rows from a table, aggregate some data, update/delete rows, show mysql.user accounts, etc.). Once you provide the question I will either: (A) operate — produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL code block) for you to execute and return the raw MySQL output to me; or (B) answer — if no further DB operations are needed, I'll produce the final answer in the required Action: Answer pattern. Before I run any SQL, here are some examples of the operations I can perform now (pick one or state a custom question):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Inspect a table's rows: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table LIMIT 100;\n- Show users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\nNote: I will only give a single SQL statement per operation step. If you want me to run one of the example queries (or a different one), tell me which and I will output the precise SQL block (Action: Operation) to execute.",
