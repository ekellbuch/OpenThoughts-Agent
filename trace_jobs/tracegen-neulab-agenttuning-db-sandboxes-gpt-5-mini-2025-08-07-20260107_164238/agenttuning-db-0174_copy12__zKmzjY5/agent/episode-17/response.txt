  "analysis": "The MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and confirmed it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). A SHOW DATABASES; executed as root over that socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The root account currently has no password (the installer used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided the specific database question yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements via mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"SQL\".",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide that question I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze the output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no SQL execution is required, I will provide the final answer using the exact required pattern (the literal line \"Action: Answer\" and then \"Final Answer: [...]\").\n\nIf you want help choosing a next operation, here are examples you can request now (specify database/table names and any conditions):\n- List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM your_database;\n- Describe a table: SHOW COLUMNS FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Select rows: SELECT * FROM your_database.your_table WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_database.your_table;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nTell me exactly which of the above (or a custom) question you want answered and whether I should Operate now.",
