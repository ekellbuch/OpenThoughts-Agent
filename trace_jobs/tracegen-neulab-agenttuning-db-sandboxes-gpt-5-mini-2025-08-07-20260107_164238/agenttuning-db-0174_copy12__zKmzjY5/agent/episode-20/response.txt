  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I manually started mysqld and verified it accepts connections on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). SHOW DATABASES; executed as root over that socket returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The MySQL data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The root account currently has no password (installer used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not provided the specific database question to answer.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to state the exact database question or operation you want performed (for example: list tables in a database, describe a table, select rows with a condition, count rows, show mysql users, modify data, etc.). Once you provide the question I will choose one of two actions:\n- Operate: I will output exactly one SQL statement in the required format (a literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: If no DB operation is required, I will provide the final answer using the exact required pattern (the literal line \"Action: Answer\" then \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\\\"]\").\n\nWhen you ask me to Operate, I will use the socket and root account (no password) like this: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\". Give me the database/table names and any conditions and I will produce the single SQL statement to execute.",
