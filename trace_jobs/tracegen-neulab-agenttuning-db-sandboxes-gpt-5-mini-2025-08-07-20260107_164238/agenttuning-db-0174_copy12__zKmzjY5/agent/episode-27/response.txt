  "analysis": "MySQL server and client are installed and running in the container. I started mysqld manually and it is listening on the UNIX socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (port 3306). I confirmed connectivity by running SHOW DATABASES; as root over that socket; it returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The data directory (/var/lib/mysql) is initialized and owned by mysql:mysql. The MySQL root account currently has no password (the installation used an insecure initialization). No application-specific queries have been executed because you have not specified what you want to query or change.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to tell me the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will do one of two things:\n- Operate: produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (the literal line \"Action: Operation\" followed by a single-line SQL statement inside an SQL markdown code block). You will execute only the first SQL code block I provide and return the raw MySQL output; I will then analyze that output and continue as needed.\n- Answer: if no DB operation is required, I will return the final answer using the exact required pattern (the literal line \"Action: Answer\" then \"Final Answer: [\\\"...\\\"]\").\n\nHelpful example operations you can ask for now (tell me which, or give a custom question):\n- List tables in a database named X: SHOW TABLES FROM X;\n- Describe a table X.Y: SHOW COLUMNS FROM X.Y;\n- Show rows from X.Y with a condition: SELECT * FROM X.Y WHERE <condition> LIMIT 100;\n- Count rows in a table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM X.Y;\n- Show MySQL users: SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n\nNote: to run any SQL I provide from this shell use: mysql -uroot -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -e \"<SQL>\" (root currently has no password).",
