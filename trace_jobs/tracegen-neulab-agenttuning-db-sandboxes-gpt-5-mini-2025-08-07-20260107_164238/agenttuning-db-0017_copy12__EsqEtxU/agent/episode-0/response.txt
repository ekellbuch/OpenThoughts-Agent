I need to discover whether a MySQL server is running in this environment and whether there are any local client credentials/config files I can use to connect non-interactively. From the terminal output I can only see the shell prompt; nothing else has been accomplished yet.",
  "plan": "1) Confirm current user and working directory. 2) Check for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 3) Check for presence of the mysql client binary and its version. 4) Inspect common locations for MySQL client config/credentials (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf, /root/.my.cnf). 5) Dump environment variables related to MySQL. Based on the results I will either connect to the database (if credentials/socket are available) or ask you for the database question and any credentials. Each command is chosen to quickly gather the required info.",
