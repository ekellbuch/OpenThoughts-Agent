Pick one of these actions and I will proceed (for actions that run SQL I will produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format when you confirm):\n\n1) Inspect metadata: list MySQL users (SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;), or list tables in a specific database (SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;), or describe a specific table.\n2) Create a test database/table and insert sample data so you can query it (I can propose a schema such as a table 'people' with id,name,email).\n3) Run a specific query you provide against a given database/table (give host/socket, db, table, and the desired query if not local).\n4) Exit / do nothing.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (database name, table name, the SQL you want run, or approval to create a test DB). After you choose, I will explain my reasoning and then either (A) produce a single Operation with one SQL statement in a one-line fenced code block for you to execute, or (B) run shell commands here if you ask me to (I will include them in the 'commands' array).",
