A SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No user databases or tables currently exist. You have not provided a specific question or instruction about what to query or modify next, so no SQL operation has been executed this round.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what to do next. Choose one of these actions and provide any required details:\n\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery: I can list users (SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;), list tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;), or show table definitions (SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;). Tell me which discovery query and the database/table name if applicable.\n\n2) Query data: Provide the database/table and the question you want answered (or give the exact SELECT). I will explain my reasoning and then produce a single Operation containing one SQL statement in the required one-line fenced code block for you to execute.\n\n3) Create a test database/table and insert sample rows: Approve an example schema (or supply your schema) and I will produce the single SQL statement to create/insert as requested (one statement per round).\n\n4) Start scanning/probing other hosts for a DB: provide allowed targets and credentials.\n\nWhen you choose an option, I will (A) explain the approach briefly, then (B) provide exactly one SQL Operation formatted per your rules (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL fenced code block). You will execute that SQL and return the output; I will parse and continue.",
