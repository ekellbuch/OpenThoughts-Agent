  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and a local MySQL server (mysqld) was installed and started successfully in this container. Root can connect via the local socket without a password. SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user databases or tables to query. You have not provided any question or instruction about what to query or modify next.",
  "plan": "I will not run further SQL until you choose one of the actions below and provide any required details. Pick one option and (if applicable) provide database/table names or the SQL you want executed. After you choose, I will: 1) explain my reasoning, and 2) produce exactly one Operation with a single-line SQL statement inside a fenced code block (per your required format). Options:\n\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery (I will provide the single SQL you must run):\n   - List MySQL users -> SQL: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database -> SQL: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; (you supply <dbname>)\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table -> SQL: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; (you supply db and table)\n\n2) Query data (you provide the database/table and the question or the SELECT you want). I will craft a single SELECT and present it as the one Operation for you to execute.\n\n3) Create test data locally (I can create a database and table and insert sample rows). Provide approval and (optionally) schema; I will produce one DDL or DML statement per round as required.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server (provide host or socket, port, username, and password or point to an existing ~/.my.cnf). Then supply the SQL you want executed or ask me to craft it.\n\n5) Do nothing / exit.\n\nTell me which option you choose and any necessary details (database name, table name, SQL, or approval to create data). I will then explain the SQL I will run and present the single Operation block for you to execute.",
