  "analysis": "You are at a root shell in /app. mysql client is installed at /usr/bin/mysql and a local MySQL server is installed and running. Root can connect via the UNIX socket without a password. SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no user databases or tables yet. No SQL has been executed in this round and no new instructions were provided.",
  "plan": "I will not run any commands until you tell me what you want. Pick one of these options and provide any required details; after you pick I will (1) explain the SQL I intend to run and then (2) provide exactly one SQL statement in the Operation format you required (Action: Operation plus a single-line SQL fenced code block). Options:\n\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery (I can run one of these):\n   - List MySQL users: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;  (you supply <dbname>)\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;  (supply db and table)\n\n2) Query data (you provide the database and the question or the exact SELECT). I will craft one SELECT and present it for you to execute.\n\n3) Create test data locally: approve creation of a sample database/table (or provide schema). I will produce one DDL or DML statement per round (e.g., CREATE DATABASE testdb; or CREATE TABLE testdb.people (...);).\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server: provide host (or socket), port (if not 3306), username and password (or credentials file path) and the SQL to run. I will format the single SQL operation accordingly.\n\n5) Do nothing / exit.\n\nWhen you choose, state the option and provide any necessary details (database/table names, SQL, or approval to create sample data). I will then produce the single Operation SQL block exactly as you required.",
