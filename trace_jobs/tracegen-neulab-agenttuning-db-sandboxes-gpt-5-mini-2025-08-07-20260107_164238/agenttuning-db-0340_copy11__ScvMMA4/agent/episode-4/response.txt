There is no MySQL server running locally: connecting to the local socket fails, no mysqld process, no socket files, and nothing is listening on port 3306. No credential files (e.g., /root/.my.cnf) were found. Therefore we cannot run SQL against a database until we either (A) get connection details for an existing MySQL server, or (B) install and start a local MySQL server in this environment.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose how you want to proceed. Pick one of the options below and I will act accordingly.\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection info: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or indicate a credentials file such as ~/.my.cnf). After you provide that, I will run exactly one SQL statement per your request; I will format it as required and you will execute it and return the output.\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local MySQL server here:\n- If you approve, I will install mysql-server, start the server, and then run a single test SQL statement to confirm connectivity. This will modify the container and may take time.\n\nOption 3 — Scan/inspect other resources for a database (only if you provide permitted targets or allow me to probe).",
