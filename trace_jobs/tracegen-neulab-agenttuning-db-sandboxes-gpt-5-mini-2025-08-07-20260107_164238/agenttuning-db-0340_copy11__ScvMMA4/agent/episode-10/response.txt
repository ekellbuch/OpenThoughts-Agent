A quick check shows only system databases: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. No user databases or tables have been found yet, so there is no application data to query at the moment.",
  "plan": "I will not make changes without your instruction. Please tell me what you want to do next. Options:\n- Inspect existing schemas/tables: I can list tables in a specific database (e.g., SHOW TABLES FROM mydb;). If you pick this, tell me the database name.\n- Query data: provide the exact SQL SELECT (or tell me the question you want answered and I will craft the query). Per your rules, when I execute SQL I will present exactly one SQL statement in an Operation block; you will run it and return the output.\n- Create or modify schema/data: I can create a database/table and insert test rows; tell me the schema or approve the action.\n- Show MySQL users/privileges: I can list users (SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;).\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any required details (database name, table name, or the SQL you want run). Once you instruct me to operate, I will produce a single Operation with the SQL in a one-line fenced code block as required. I will also include the exact shell command I will run (mysql -uroot -e \"<SQL>\") so you can execute it.",
