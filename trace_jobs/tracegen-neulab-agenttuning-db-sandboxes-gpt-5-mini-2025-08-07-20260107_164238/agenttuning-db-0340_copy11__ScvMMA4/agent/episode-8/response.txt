  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app. The mysql client is installed and working (/usr/bin/mysql). No MySQL server is currently running or accessible from this container (attempts to use the default socket failed earlier). To be able to run SQL locally we must either connect to an external server (you provide host/creds) or install and start a local MySQL server. You have not provided connection details, so to proceed autonomously the next reasonable step is to install and start a local MySQL server in this environment. Installing the server may require additional steps depending on how the package initializes root authentication (e.g., temporary password in logs or auth_socket).",
  "plan": "I will install the mysql-server package, start the MySQL service, verify the server process and socket, then run a simple test query SELECT VERSION(); to confirm the server is up. Specific commands:\n1) apt-get update — refresh package lists.\n2) apt-get install -y mysql-server — install the server package.\n3) service mysql start — attempt to start the server (package often starts it automatically). If this fails, we may try mysqld_safe fallback.\n4) ps aux | egrep mysqld — verify the server process is running.\n5) ls -la /var/run/mysqld — verify the socket exists.\n6) mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\" — run a quick test query. If authentication prevents running as root without a password, we'll inspect the MySQL error log (/var/log/mysql) or try auth_socket or look for the temporary root password in the logs and proceed based on that information. Each command is included as keystrokes and will be run sequentially.",
