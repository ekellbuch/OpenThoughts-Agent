Choose one of the options below and provide any required details; after you choose I will (1) explain my reasoning and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your protocol (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL fenced code block) for you to execute.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery:\n   - List MySQL users: I will run SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: tell me the database name and I will run SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table: tell me db.table and I will run SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table;\n\n2) Query data:\n   - Provide the database/table and the question you want answered (or provide the exact SELECT). I will craft and present a single SQL for you to run.\n\n3) Create test data locally:\n   - Approve creation of a sample database/table (or provide schema). I will then produce the DDL/DML (one statement per round) to create and/or populate it.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server:\n   - Provide host (or socket), port (if not 3306), username and password (or point to a credentials file) and the SQL you want executed; I will format the single SQL operation accordingly.\n\n5) Do nothing / exit.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply any necessary details (database name, table name, SQL, or approval to create test data).",
