  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose the next action. Pick one of these and provide any needed details:\n\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery (I will provide one SQL to run):\n   - List MySQL users: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n   - Describe or show create for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;\n\n2) Query data (you provide the database/table and the question, or ask me to craft a SELECT): I will explain my reasoning and then provide a single SQL statement to execute.\n\n3) Create a test database/table and insert sample rows (approve schema or provide schema). I will then provide the SQL (one statement per round) to create/insert.\n\n4) Scan/probe other allowed hosts for a MySQL server (provide targets and credentials if needed).\n\nWhen you choose, I will (1) explain my approach briefly, then (2) produce exactly one Operation containing a single-line SQL statement inside a fenced code block per your required format for you to execute. No commands will be run until you confirm which option and provide any needed parameters.",
