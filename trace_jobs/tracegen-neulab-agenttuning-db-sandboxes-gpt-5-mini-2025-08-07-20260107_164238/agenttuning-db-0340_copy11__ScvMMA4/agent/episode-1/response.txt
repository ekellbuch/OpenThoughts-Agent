  "analysis": "Current environment: a root shell in /app. There are no project files. No mysqld process is running. The mysql client is not installed (mysql: command not found). Common MySQL directories (/var/run/mysqld, /etc/mysql) do not exist. No MYSQL/MARIADB environment variables were found and no service is listening on port 3306. Nothing has been queried from a database yet; we cannot run SQL until we have a client and connection information (host/port/user/password or socket).",
  "plan": "Install a MySQL-compatible client so we can run SQL against a reachable server once credentials/host are provided. Steps: 1) update apt package lists. 2) install a MySQL client (default-mysql-client). 3) verify the client is installed and show its path/version. After that, wait for database connection details (host/credentials). If you provide host/user/password or a socket, I'll run a single SQL statement as required. Expected outcomes: apt-get update will refresh package indexes; apt-get install will install the mysql client; mysql --version and which mysql will confirm installation.",
