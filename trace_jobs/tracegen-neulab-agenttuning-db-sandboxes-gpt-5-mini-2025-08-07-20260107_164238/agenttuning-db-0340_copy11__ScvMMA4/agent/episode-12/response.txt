Options you can pick (tell me which one you want):\n\n1) Inspect server metadata (discovery queries):\n   - List MySQL users: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>;\n   - Describe a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>;\n\n2) Query data (you provide the database/table and the question, or I can craft a query if you describe the desired result).\n\n3) Create a test database/table and insert sample rows so we can run queries (provide schema or approve my example schema).\n\n4) Exit or no-op.\n\nWhen you pick an option, I will (1) explain my reasoning, then (2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your protocol (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL fenced code block). You will execute that SQL and return the output; I will then parse and continue. If you want me to run a shell command first instead of SQL, tell me which command.",
