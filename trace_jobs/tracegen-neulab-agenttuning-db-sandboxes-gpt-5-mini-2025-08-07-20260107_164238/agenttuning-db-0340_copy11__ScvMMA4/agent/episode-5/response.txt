  "analysis": "The mysql client is installed and functional at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server accessible from this container: attempts to connect to the default local socket failed, no mysqld processes or .sock files were found, and nothing listens on port 3306. No credential files (/root/.my.cnf) were found. In short: we currently cannot run SQL against a database until you either (A) provide connection details for an existing server, or (B) allow me to install and start a local MySQL server in this environment so we can create/connect to databases locally.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your decision. Choose one of the options below and I will proceed accordingly.\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or indicate a credentials file such as ~/.my.cnf). After you provide that, tell me the single SQL statement you want executed (or ask me to run a specific query). I will then produce one Operation step formatted exactly per your instructions, with the SQL in a single-line markdown code block. Example of the command I would run (non-interactively) once you give details: mysql -hHOST -PPORT -uUSER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SQL_STATEMENT\"\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local MySQL server here:\n- If you permit, I will install mysql-server, initialize and start the server, and then run a test query. The commands I would run (if you approve) are:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) service mysql start\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n  Note: installation will change the container, may take time, and root password handling may require additional steps (e.g., reading temporary root password or configuring auth). I will follow up with exact single-line SQL to execute after the server is running.\n\nOption 3 — Scan/inspect other hosts or containers for an available MySQL server:\n- If you want me to probe, provide allowed target hostnames/IPs or an instruction to scan local network ranges. I will then attempt connections (respecting any scope you provide) and report findings.\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and, for Option 1, provide the connection details (host/socket, port, username, password or indicate credentials file). Once you provide that, I will produce the single SQL Operation step in the exact format you required.",
