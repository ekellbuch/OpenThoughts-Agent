  "plan": "I will wait for you to choose the next action. Pick one of these options and provide any required details; after you choose I will (1) explain my reasoning and then (2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL in a fenced code block) for you to execute.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery\n   - List MySQL users: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; (you supply <dbname>)\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; (supply db and table)\n\n2) Query data\n   - Provide the database/table and the question you want answered (or provide the exact SELECT). I will craft one SELECT and present it as the single SQL operation.\n\n3) Create test data locally\n   - Approve creation of a sample database/table (I can propose schema, e.g., CREATE DATABASE testdb; CREATE TABLE testdb.people (id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(100), email VARCHAR(255));). If you approve, I will produce the SQL statements one at a time per your execution cycle.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server\n   - Provide host (or socket), port (if not 3306), username and password (or point to a ~/.my.cnf). Then provide the SQL to run (or ask me to craft it).\n\n5) Do nothing / exit\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any necessary details (database name, table name, SQL, or approval to create test data). After you reply I will prepare the single SQL Operation statement (and explain my reasoning) for you to execute.",
