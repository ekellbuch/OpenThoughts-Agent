  "analysis": "I inspected the container and installed the MySQL client. Current facts: the mysql client is present at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server running on this host: attempts to connect to the local socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock fail (ERROR 2002). There are no mysqld processes, no socket files were found, /var/run/mysqld and /etc/mysql were previously absent, and nothing is listening on TCP port 3306. No MySQL credential files (e.g., /root/.my.cnf) were found. In short: we have a client but no accessible server yet, so we cannot run SQL against a database until we either (A) connect to an external MySQL server with credentials you provide, or (B) install and start a local MySQL server in this environment.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your choice. You can pick one of the following options and I will proceed accordingly:\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have a DB elsewhere):\n- Provide connection details: host (or socket), port (if nonstandard), username, and password (or indicate any client config file with credentials).\n- Once you provide those, I will run exactly one SQL statement (per the rules) to perform the requested query. Example command I would run (non-interactive): mysql -h HOST -P PORT -uUSER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SINGLE SQL STATEMENT\". I will only put the SQL in the required markdown form when you want me to operate.\n\nOption 2 — Start a local MySQL server here (if you want the DB created locally):\n- I can install and initialize a local MySQL server package (mysql-server) and start it. This will create server files under /var/lib/mysql, add configuration under /etc/mysql, and start mysqld. I will then connect as root (initial setup may require setting/knowing the root password or using auth_socket). Steps I would run if you permit:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) systemctl start mysql || service mysql start || mysqld_safe & (depending on environment)\n  4) check socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and run a test: mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n- Note: installing a server changes the environment and may take a while. If you approve, I will run those commands.\n\nOption 3 — If you want me to search for a database server running on other containers/hosts in the environment, provide targets or allow me to scan (I can check common hostnames/IPs or check Docker links), but I need permitted scope.\n\nTell me which option you choose and, if Option 1, provide the connection information (host/socket, port, username, password or indicate an accessible ~/.my.cnf). After you provide that, I will (per the protocol you set) either perform an Operation with a single SQL statement or finalize the Answer when done.",
