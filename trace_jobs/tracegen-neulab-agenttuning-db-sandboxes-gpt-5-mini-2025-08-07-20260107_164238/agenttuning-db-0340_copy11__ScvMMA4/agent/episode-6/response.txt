  "analysis": "You are in a root shell in /app. The MySQL client (mysql) is installed and at /usr/bin/mysql. There is no MySQL server accessible from this container: attempts to connect to the default socket failed (ERROR 2002), there are no mysqld processes, no .sock files were found, and nothing is listening on TCP port 3306. No credential files (e.g., /root/.my.cnf) were found. Therefore we cannot execute SQL against a database until either (A) you provide connection details for an available MySQL server, or (B) you allow me to install and start a local MySQL server in this environment.",
  "plan": "I will not run any changes until you pick one of these options. Pick an option and provide any required details; I will then perform the requested operation and return the single SQL result per your protocol.\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide connection parameters: host (or socket path), port (if nonstandard), username, and password (or indicate that credentials are in a client config file such as ~/.my.cnf). Optionally provide the exact SQL query you want run. Once you provide those, I will produce a single Operation step formatted exactly as you specified (Action: Operation, then a single SQL statement in a one-line fenced code block). Example non-interactive command I will run (not executed until you confirm):\n  mysql -hHOST -PPORT -uUSER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SINGLE_SQL_STATEMENT\"\n\nOption 2 — Install and run a local MySQL server here:\n- If you permit, I will install mysql-server, start the service, and run a test query to confirm it is up. Expected commands (I will run them if you approve):\n  apt-get update\n  apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  service mysql start\n  mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n- Note: installing a server will change the container and may require additional steps to set root password or use auth_socket. After the server is running I will perform one SQL statement per your instruction.\n\nOption 3 — Scan or probe other hosts/containers for a database:\n- If you want me to look for an existing DB on specific hosts or ranges, provide allowed targets and I will attempt connections and report back.\n\nPlease reply with which option you choose. If Option 1, include connection details (host/socket, port, user, password or indicate a credentials file) and the single SQL statement you want executed. If Option 2, explicitly permit installation of mysql-server. After you respond I will proceed and, if performing SQL, I will format the SQL as required so you can execute it and return the output.",
