  "analysis": "I see a root shell prompt in /app but no other context or outputs. The terminal shows no prior commands besides the shell startup messages. There is no evidence yet whether a MySQL server is running or whether the mysql client is installed. To answer database questions I need to discover if a MySQL server is present, where its socket/port is, and whether I can connect (and with which credentials). Nothing has been accomplished yet toward connecting to or querying a database.",
  "plan": "1) Inspect the current working directory and listing to see any project files or credentials. 2) Check whether a mysqld process is running. 3) Check whether the mysql client is installed and its version. 4) Inspect common MySQL runtime and configuration locations (/var/run/mysqld, /etc/mysql). 5) Inspect environment variables for MYSQL_* values. 6) Check listening ports for a MySQL server (port 3306). 7) Attempt a non-interactive connection with the mysql client to run a simple query (SELECT VERSION()) to verify connectivity. Each command is chosen to gather information needed before issuing any SQL against the database.",
