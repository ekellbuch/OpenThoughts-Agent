  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container. The mysql client is at /usr/bin/mysql and root can connect via the local socket without a password. A previous SHOW DATABASES; returned only system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user databases or tables present. You have not specified what you want to do next (inspect metadata, run a query, create test data, or connect to a remote server).",
  "plan": "I will not make any changes until you choose one of the following actions. Pick one and (if applicable) provide details; after you pick I will explain my reasoning and then produce a single SQL statement (in the exact Operation format you required) for you to execute.\n\nOptions:\n1) Inspect metadata (discovery)\n   - List MySQL users: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; (you supply <dbname>)\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; (you supply db and table)\n\n2) Query data\n   - Provide the database/table and the question you want answered (or the exact SELECT). I will craft the SQL and present it as one Operation statement.\n\n3) Create a test database/table and insert sample data locally\n   - If you approve, I will create a database (e.g., testdb) and a sample table (e.g., people id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), email VARCHAR(255)) and insert sample rows. Tell me to proceed and I will produce the SQL statements one at a time per your execution cycle.\n\n4) Connect to a remote/other MySQL server\n   - Provide host or socket, port (if not 3306), username and password (or point to a credentials file). Then provide the SQL to run (or ask me to craft it). I will produce the Operation-formatted SQL for you to execute against that server.\n\n5) Do nothing / exit\n\nTell me which option you choose and any required details (database/table names, SQL, or permission to create test data). After you reply I will (A) explain my approach and (B) produce exactly one Operation block containing a single-line SQL statement in a fenced code block (which you will execute and return the output).",
