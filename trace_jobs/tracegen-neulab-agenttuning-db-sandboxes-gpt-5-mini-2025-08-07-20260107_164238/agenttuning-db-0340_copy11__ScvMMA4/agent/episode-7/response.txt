  "analysis": "You have a root shell in /app. The MySQL client is installed (/usr/bin/mysql) and works, but there is no MySQL server accessible from this container: connecting to the default socket fails (ERROR 2002), there are no mysqld processes, no socket files found, and nothing is listening on TCP 3306. No credential files (e.g., /root/.my.cnf) exist. Therefore no SQL can be executed against a database until either (A) you provide connection details for an existing server, or (B) you allow me to install and start a local MySQL server in this environment.",
  "plan": "I will not change the environment without your explicit choice. Choose one of the actions below and I will proceed accordingly.\n\nOption 1 — Connect to an existing MySQL server (recommended if you have one):\n- Provide the connection details: host (or unix socket path), port (if not 3306), username, and password (or indicate credentials in a client config file such as ~/.my.cnf). Also provide the single SQL statement you want executed (or instruct me what to query). After you provide that, I will output one Operation step formatted exactly per your rules with the SQL in a single-line fenced code block. I will then run the corresponding mysql command non-interactively (e.g., mysql -hHOST -PPORT -uUSER -p'PASSWORD' -e \"SQL\").\n\nOption 2 — Install and start a local MySQL server here:\n- If you permit, I will install mysql-server, initialize and start the service, then run a test query. The commands I would run (if you approve) are:\n  1) apt-get update\n  2) apt-get install -y mysql-server\n  3) service mysql start\n  4) mysql -uroot -e \"SELECT VERSION();\"\n- Note: installing a server modifies the container, may require extra steps to obtain or set the root password (e.g., reading the temporary root password from logs or configuring auth_socket). If you approve this, I will execute the commands and then proceed to the SQL you request.\n\nOption 3 — Probe other hosts/containers you permit me to check:\n- Provide allowed hostnames/IPs or ranges and credentials (if any). I can attempt connections to find an available server.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide any needed connection details or explicit permission to install a server. Once you do, I will either produce the single SQL Operation (with the SQL in a one-line fenced code block as required) or run the install/start sequence and then perform a test SQL operation.",
