  "analysis": "The container has a working MySQL client (/usr/bin/mysql) and a MySQL server (mysqld) is installed and running. Root can connect over the local UNIX socket without a password. A SHOW DATABASES; returned only the system schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are currently no user databases or application tables to query. You have not specified a question or which operation you want next.",
  "plan": "I will not change the server until you tell me which action to take. Please choose one of these options and provide any required details; after you choose I will (1) explain the SQL I will run and (2) provide exactly one SQL statement (when executing) formatted per your protocol (Action: Operation with a single-line SQL fence). Options:\n\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery (I will produce one SQL to run):\n   - List MySQL users: SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; (you supply <dbname>)\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table: SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; (supply db and table)\n\n2) Query data (you provide the db/table and the question or the exact SELECT). I will craft and present one SELECT.\n\n3) Create test data locally (I will create a sample database/table and insert rows). If you approve, specify a schema or allow me to propose one (e.g., database testdb, table people(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), email VARCHAR(255))). I will then provide one DDL/DML statement per round as required.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server (provide host or socket, port if not 3306, username and password or path to a credentials file). Then provide the SQL you want executed or ask me to craft it.\n\n5) Do nothing / exit.\n\nWhen you reply, state which option you choose and any necessary details (database name, table name, SQL, or approval to create test data). If you pick an option that runs SQL, I will explain my reasoning and then give the single Operation SQL block (one-line SQL in a fenced code block) for you to execute.",
