  "analysis": "MySQL server is installed and running in the container. The mysql client is available at /usr/bin/mysql and root can connect via the local socket without a password. A check for databases returned only system schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. There are no user databases or application tables present yet, so there is nothing to query for application data at this time. No specific question or target table/database was provided by you yet.",
  "plan": "I need you to tell me what you want to do next. Options and what I'll do for each:\n\n1) You provide a question about the database (e.g., \"list all users\", \"show tables in database X\", \"select rows from table Y where ...\"). I will explain my reasoning and then produce one SQL Operation statement formatted exactly as you required (Action: Operation and a single-line SQL in a fenced code block). You will run that one SQL and return its output; I will parse the output and continue as needed.\n\n2) If you want me to explore the server to find objects, I can run discovery queries. Examples I can run (one per round):\n   - SHOW DATABASES; (already done)\n   - SHOW TABLES FROM mysql;\n   - SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema LIKE '%';\n  Tell me which discovery query you want and I will produce the single SQL Operation statement for you to execute.\n\n3) If you want me to create a local database/table and insert test data so we can run queries, tell me the schema and data. I will then produce DDL/DML as single SQL statements per your execution cycle.\n\nTell me which option you choose and (if relevant) provide the database/table/SQL or the question you want answered. After you respond, I will think through the exact SQL needed, explain my reasoning, and then provide the one Operation SQL block for you to execute.",
