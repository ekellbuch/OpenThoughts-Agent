  "plan": "I will not run any further commands until you tell me which action you want. Please choose one of the options below and provide any required details; after you choose I will (1) explain my reasoning and (2) produce exactly one SQL statement (if applicable) in the required Operation format for you to execute.\n\nOptions (pick one):\n1) Inspect metadata/discovery\n   - List MySQL users: will run SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;\n   - List tables in a database: will run SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname>; (you supply <dbname>)\n   - Show CREATE TABLE for a table: will run SHOW CREATE TABLE <dbname>.<table>; (supply db and table)\n\n2) Query data\n   - Provide the database/table and the question (or the exact SELECT). I will craft a single SELECT and present it for you to run.\n\n3) Create test data locally\n   - Approve creation of a sample database/table (or provide schema). I will produce the DDL/DML statements one at a time per your execution cycle.\n\n4) Connect to a remote MySQL server\n   - Provide host (or socket), port (if not 3306), username and password (or path to a credentials file) and the SQL to run. I will format the single SQL operation accordingly.\n\n5) Do nothing / exit\n\nReply with which option you choose and any necessary details (database/table name, SQL, or approval to create test data).",
