  "analysis": "The mysql client was not present but I installed default-mysql-client successfully. 'mysql --version' and 'which mysql' confirm the client is available at /usr/bin/mysql. There is still no evidence of a running MySQL server: earlier checks showed no mysqld process, /var/run/mysqld and /etc/mysql were missing, and nothing listened on port 3306. To run SQL I need a reachable MySQL server and credentials (host/socket, port, user, password).",
  "plan": "1) Attempt a quick non-interactive connection as root (likely to fail if no server). 2) Check for client config files that may contain credentials (/root/.my.cnf and /root/.my.cnf.d), and list /home for other user configs. 3) Search for unix socket files (*.sock) in common locations (limited-depth search) to find a local server socket. 4) Re-check listening TCP ports for 3306. 5) Show /etc/hosts in case a hostname points to a DB container. If you provide host/port/user/password (or a socket path), I will run a single SQL statement in the required one-line SQL markdown block next. Each command is for discovery and should be quick.",
