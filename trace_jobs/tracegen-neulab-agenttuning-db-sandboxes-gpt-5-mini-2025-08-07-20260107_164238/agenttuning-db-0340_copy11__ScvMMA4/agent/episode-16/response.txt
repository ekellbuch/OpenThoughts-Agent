Pick one of these options and provide any required details; I will then produce exactly one SQL statement (if applicable) formatted per your rules for you to execute:\n\n- Option A: Inspect metadata/discovery\n  * List MySQL users (I will run SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;).\n  * List tables in a specific database (you provide the database name, I'll run SHOW TABLES FROM <dbname> ;).\n  * Show CREATE TABLE for a specific table (you provide db.table, I'll run SHOW CREATE TABLE db.table ;).\n\n- Option B: Query data\n  * Provide the database/table and the question or the exact SELECT you want. I will explain the approach and produce one SQL to execute.\n\n- Option C: Create test data locally\n  * Approve that I create a sample database/table and insert rows (specify schema or allow me to propose one). I will then produce one DDL or DML statement per your execution cycle.\n\n- Option D: Connect to a remote server\n  * Provide host (or socket), port, username, and password (or indicate an existing ~/.my.cnf) and the SQL you want run. I will then produce a single SQL statement executed via the mysql client.\n\nTell me which option you choose and supply any needed details (database/table name, SQL, or permission to create a sample DB). After you respond, I will explain my reasoning and provide the single Operation SQL statement (in the required one-line fenced code block) for you to execute.",
