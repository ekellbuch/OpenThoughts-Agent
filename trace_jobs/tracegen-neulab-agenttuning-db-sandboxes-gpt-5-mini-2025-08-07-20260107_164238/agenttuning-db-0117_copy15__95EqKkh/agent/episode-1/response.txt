  "analysis": "So far I inspected the container. The current /app directory is empty. There is no mysql process running, the mysql client is not installed, there is no /var/run/mysqld socket, and /etc/mysql/debian.cnf is absent or empty. In short: there is no local MySQL server or client available yet and no obvious automatic credentials. To run SQL against MySQL I must either install a MySQL client and connect to a server (if one exists remotely) or find a database dump or credentials on the filesystem to use locally. At this point no SQL has been executed.",
  "plan": "1) Install a MySQL client so I can connect if a server is reachable. (apt-get update && apt-get install default-mysql-client). 2) Verify the client installed correctly. 3) Search the environment and filesystem for MySQL-related credentials, config files, or SQL dumps (check env, /root/.my.cnf, find common filenames). If I find credentials or a socket or a dump I will use that to run SQL. If no credentials or server is present, I'll report back and ask for connection details. Expected results: after installing client, mysql --version will be available; the find/cat commands may reveal a my.cnf, .my.cnf, SQL dump, or a database file we can use.",
