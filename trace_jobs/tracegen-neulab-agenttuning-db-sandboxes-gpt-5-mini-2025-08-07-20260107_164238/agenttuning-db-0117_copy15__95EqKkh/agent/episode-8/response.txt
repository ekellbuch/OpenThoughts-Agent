  "analysis": "You are in a container with the MySQL client installed (mysql 8.0), but there is no MySQL server accessible: no mysqld process, no UNIX socket, and connection to 127.0.0.1:3306 fails. I searched the filesystem and environment and found no credential files (.my.cnf) or SQL dumps to import. Without either (A) connection details for a reachable MySQL server or (B) a database dump to import locally (or (C) permission to install and run a local server), I cannot execute SQL queries from this environment.",
  "plan": "Provide one clear next choice so I can proceed. Choose exactly one of the following options and supply the needed info:\n\nOption A — Connect to an existing server (recommended if you have a DB elsewhere):\n  - Provide host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, and password (or path to unix socket). Example: host=192.0.2.5 port=3306 user=myuser password=mypassword\n  - After you provide that, I will produce the single SQL statement you want executed in the required format and show the mysql client command I will use.\n\nOption B — Import a SQL dump into this container:\n  - Place the dump file inside the container (path to .sql or .sql.gz) or provide a URL I can wget/curl. Example: /app/dump.sql or https://example.com/dump.sql.gz\n  - Tell me if you want me to install and run a local server or use a temporary serverless import method. If you approve installing a local server, I will proceed to install and initialize it, then import the dump.\n\nOption C — Install and run a local MySQL/MariaDB server in this container (I can do this if you confirm):\n  - If you confirm, I will apt-get install a server package, initialize a server (using insecure initialization or a generated root password per your direction), start mysqld manually (without systemd), create a user if requested, and then run or accept SQL.\n\nIf you pick Option A, I can immediately produce the one-line SQL to run (in the required format). If you pick Option B or C, tell me and I will run the necessary preparation commands. If you want me to proceed with installing a local server now, confirm and I will run the installation and initialization commands.",
