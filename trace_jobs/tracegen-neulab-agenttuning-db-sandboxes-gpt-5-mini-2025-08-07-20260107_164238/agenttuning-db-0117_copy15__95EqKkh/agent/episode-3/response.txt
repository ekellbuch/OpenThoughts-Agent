  "analysis": "We have a shell in the container. The mysql client was installed successfully (mysql 8.0). There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no /var/run/mysqld socket) and no obvious credential files or SQL dumps were found. At this point there is no detectable database server to run SQL against from this container. To proceed we must either locate reachable database connection info on the filesystem or be given host/port/user/password (or a dump) to connect to. Before asking you for credentials, I will try a quick connectivity probe to see whether a MySQL server is reachable on the usual localhost TCP port and whether environment variables contain connection info.",
  "plan": "1) Look for common DB-related environment variables (DB_HOST, DATABASE_URL, etc.) to see if connection info is provided in the environment. 2) Try to connect to 127.0.0.1:3306 using the mysql client with a short connect-timeout to detect a local TCP server. This will fail fast if no server is listening. 3) Print the container IP addresses so you can decide if a remote host on the same network might be used. If these probes do not find a reachable server or credentials, I'll ask you to provide host, port, user and password (or a SQL dump) so I can execute SQL as requested.",
