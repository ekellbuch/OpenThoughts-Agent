  "analysis": "The MySQL server package installation began in the previous step and package configuration messages were shown (debconf fallback to Readline). The system is in the process of installing mysql-server-8.0. The next necessary steps are to ensure the mysqld service is started and then verify we can connect as root (the container's root user typically can connect via the unix_socket authentication plugin). After that I'll create a test database 'testdb' and a user 'tester' with password 'tester' (allowed from any host '%') so you can run queries as that user. If the server fails to start, I'll report the error and propose alternatives.",
  "plan": "1) Attempt to start the mysql service (service mysql start). 2) Check for mysqld process to confirm it's running. 3) Check mysqladmin version and then try to connect as root to run SHOW DATABASES to confirm connectivity. 4) Create a database 'testdb' and a user 'tester'@'%' with password 'tester', grant privileges and flush privileges. 5) Verify by connecting as tester and listing databases. Each command is short and will allow me to inspect the result and proceed accordingly.",
