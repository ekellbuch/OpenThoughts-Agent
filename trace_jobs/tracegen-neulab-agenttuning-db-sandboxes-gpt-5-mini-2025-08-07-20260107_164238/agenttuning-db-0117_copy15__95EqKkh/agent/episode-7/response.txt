  "analysis": "You have an Ubuntu container with the mysql client installed (mysql 8.0). There is no MySQL server reachable from this container: no mysqld process, no /var/run/mysqld socket, and attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:3306 failed. I searched common filesystem locations and environment variables and found no credentials or SQL dumps to use. Therefore I cannot run any SQL against a database yet because no database server or dump/credentials have been provided.",
  "plan": "I need you to choose one of the following options so I can proceed:\n\nOption A — Provide connection details for an existing MySQL server reachable from this container:\n  - host (or IP), port (default 3306), username, password (or path to socket). If TLS is required, include cert/key details. After you provide these, I will produce the single SQL statement (in the required format) you want executed and the exact mysql client command I'll run.\n\nOption B — Provide a SQL dump file placed inside this container (or a URL I can fetch). I can then import it into a locally running server. If you choose this, tell me the dump path or URL and whether to import into a temporary local server.\n\nOption C — Ask me to install and run a local MySQL server in this container. If you want that, confirm and I will: apt-get install -y mysql-server (or mariadb-server if preferred), initialize and start the server, create a user, and then import a dump or accept your SQL queries.\n\nOnce you choose and provide the necessary details, I'll either (1) run the required preparation commands here, or (2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute (per your rules).",
