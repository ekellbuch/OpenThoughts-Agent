  "analysis": "We have a shell in a container. The mysql client was not present initially but I installed default-mysql-client successfully; mysql --version now shows MySQL client 8.0. There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no /var/run/mysqld socket). A filesystem search found only /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/my.cnf (an alternatives link) and no obvious .my.cnf or SQL dump. At this point there is no detectable local server or credentials to connect to. To proceed we either need to find credentials/configuration on the filesystem that point to a server, or the user must provide connection details (host, port, user, password or socket).",
  "plan": "1) Check listening TCP sockets to see if any MySQL-compatible servers are listening (3306 or other). 2) Inspect /etc/mysql and the dpkg alternatives my.cnf fallback to see if there are config files with connection info. 3) Inspect PID 1 environment for any MYSQL_ variables (common in containers linked to a DB). 4) Search common directories (/etc, /root, /home, /app, /var) for files containing the string 'mysql' or typical DB credential terms to discover connection info or dumps. Based on what we find, we can (a) attempt a connection with the mysql client or (b) ask you to provide connection details so I can issue the SQL you request. The commands below implement these checks.",
