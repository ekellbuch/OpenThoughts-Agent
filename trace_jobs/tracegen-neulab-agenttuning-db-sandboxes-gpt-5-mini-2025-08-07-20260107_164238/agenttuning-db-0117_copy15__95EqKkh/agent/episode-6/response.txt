I searched common locations and found no credential files (.my.cnf) or SQL dumps to import. The container IP is 172.17.0.37. Without a reachable MySQL server or a database dump and credentials, I cannot run SQL queries from here.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n- Remote connection details: host (or IP), port, username, and password (or path to unix socket). If TLS/ssl options are required mention them. Once you provide connection info I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute; I can also demonstrate the exact mysql client command I'll use to run it.\n- Or provide a SQL dump file (path inside this container) or put it somewhere I can download; I will import it locally and then run queries.\n\nIf you give connection details and want me to test connectivity first, I can run short mysql client connection tests. If you want me to import a dump, tell me its path or upload it and I will import it into a temporary local MySQL instance (if you want me to install and run a server) or into an available remote server if you provide credentials.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the necessary details. After that I will either:\n- produce a single SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation plus one SQL code block) for you to execute, or\n- run the commands to import a dump and then produce the SQL statement to execute against the imported DB.",
