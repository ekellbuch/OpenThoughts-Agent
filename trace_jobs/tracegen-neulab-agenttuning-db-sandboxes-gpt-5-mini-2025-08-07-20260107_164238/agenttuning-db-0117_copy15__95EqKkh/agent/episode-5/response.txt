  "analysis": "The container has the mysql client installed and its network IP is 172.17.0.37. There is no local MySQL server running (no mysqld process, no socket, can't connect to 127.0.0.1:3306). I did not find any credential files (.my.cnf) or SQL dumps on the filesystem and there are no DB-related environment variables. Therefore I cannot execute SQL until I have a reachable database or a dump to import locally.",
  "plan": "I need you to provide one of the following so I can proceed:\n- Connection details for a reachable MySQL server (host or IP, port, user, password, or path to socket). I will then run the single SQL statement you request (in the required format) against that server. Example connection I would use: mysql -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p'<password>' -e \"<SQL>\". Note: include quotes around password if it contains special chars.\n- Or, upload or place a SQL dump file inside the container (path to a .sql or .sql.gz) so I can import it locally and run queries against the imported database.\n\nIf you provide connection details, specify whether I should connect over TCP or use a Unix socket. Once you give details, I will (per your rules) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format for you to execute. If you want me to run any preparatory commands (like importing a dump), tell me and I will run them.",
