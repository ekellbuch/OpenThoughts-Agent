  "analysis": "I installed the MySQL client successfully and verified mysql --version. There is no local MySQL server running (can't connect to 127.0.0.1:3306 and no mysqld process or UNIX socket). I couldn't find credentials or SQL dumps on the filesystem or in environment variables. Therefore, from this container there is currently no reachable database to run SQL against without additional connection details or a dump to import.",
  "plan": "I will provide the container's network addresses so you can determine whether a remote MySQL server is reachable from here. After that, I need you to provide one of the following so I can run SQL: (A) connection details (host, port, user, password or path to a socket), or (B) a database dump file to import here. Once you supply connection info (or a dump), I'll run a single SQL statement you request per round following the required format. The next commands will print the container IP(s) and /etc/hosts to help with connectivity decisions.",
