  "analysis": "We are at a shell prompt (root@...:/app#). No prior commands have been run in this session. Nothing has been accomplished yet toward connecting to or querying a MySQL database. To proceed we need to discover whether a MySQL server is running, whether the mysql client exists, where the UNIX socket or network port is, and whether any configuration files contain usable credentials (e.g., /etc/mysql/debian.cnf). Once we know how to connect, we can run the single SQL statement requested each round. Right now we must gather environment information.",
  "plan": "1) List files in the current directory to see if any project/db files are present. 2) Check for running MySQL/MariaDB processes. 3) Check whether the mysql client is available and its version. 4) Inspect the usual socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) for socket file and ownership. 5) If present, show /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (a common place for automatic local root credentials) to possibly get connection credentials. Based on these results, we'll decide the next command to actually connect and run SQL. Each command will be short and non-blocking so we can inspect outputs and choose the appropriate SQL to run next.",
