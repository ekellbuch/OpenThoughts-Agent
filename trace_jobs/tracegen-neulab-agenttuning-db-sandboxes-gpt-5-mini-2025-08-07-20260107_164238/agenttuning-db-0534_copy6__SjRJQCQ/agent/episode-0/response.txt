There is no information yet about a MySQL server or its databases. Before executing any SQL I need to discover whether MySQL/MariaDB server is installed and running, where the data directory is, and whether a client or credentials are available. After those checks I can connect and run the SQL you request.",
  "plan": "1) Run a few quick environment & filesystem checks to locate MySQL config and data dir (/etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql) and check for a client. 2) Check for a running mysqld process and whether port 3306 is listening. 3) Check for a local ~/.my.cnf which might contain credentials. I will not attempt an interactive mysql login yet. Based on the outputs I'll ask for your question or attempt a safe connection with discovered credentials.",
