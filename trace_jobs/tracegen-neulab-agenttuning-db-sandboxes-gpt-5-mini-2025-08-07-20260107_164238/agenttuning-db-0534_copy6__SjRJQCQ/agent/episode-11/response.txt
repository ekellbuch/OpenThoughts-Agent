  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL server or client and no SQL dumps or DB files to operate on. Previous attempts to install the client were only echoed and not executed (so the mysql client is still not present). To run SQL I need the mysql client available in this environment or you must provide connection details to a reachable MySQL server or place a SQL dump in the container. The next step is to actually install the default MySQL client in this container and verify it's present so I can connect when you provide credentials or a dump path.",
  "plan": "1) Run apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) Install default-mysql-client non-interactively so the 'mysql' CLI is available. 3) Verify installation with mysql --version and which mysql. 4) Prompt you to provide MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or to place a SQL dump file in the container and tell me its path. If installation fails, we'll inspect the error output and decide next steps.",
