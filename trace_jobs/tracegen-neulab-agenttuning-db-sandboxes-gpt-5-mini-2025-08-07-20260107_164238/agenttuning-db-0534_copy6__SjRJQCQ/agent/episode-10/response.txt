  "analysis": "So far the container has no MySQL server/client and no database dumps. Previous attempts only echoed the intended apt-get commands rather than running them. To be able to run SQL (against a remote MySQL server you provide or a local dump you add), I need a mysql client in this container. I will now actually run apt-get update and install the default-mysql-client, then verify the installation. After that I'll ask you to provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or place a SQL dump in the container and tell me its path.",
  "plan": "1) Run apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) Install default-mysql-client non-interactively so the 'mysql' CLI is available. 3) Verify installation with mysql --version and which mysql. 4) Prompt you for MySQL connection details or the path to a SQL dump so I can proceed to run SQL statements. If installation fails, we will inspect the error output and reassess.",
