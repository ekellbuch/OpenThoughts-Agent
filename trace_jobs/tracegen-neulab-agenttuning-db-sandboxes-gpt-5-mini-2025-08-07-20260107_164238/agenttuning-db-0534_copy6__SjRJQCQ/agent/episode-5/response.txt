  "analysis": "Previous checks show no MySQL server or client and no database files in the container. You previously allowed installing a client; the environment printed the intended install commands but they haven't produced outputs yet. To be able to run SQL (against a remote MySQL server you provide, or to work with a dump you place here), I need a mysql client binary available. I'll install the default MySQL client so we can connect to a server when you give connection details or import a dump if you place one in the container.",
  "plan": "1) Update apt package lists (apt-get update). 2) Install the default-mysql-client package (apt-get install -y default-mysql-client). 3) Verify installation with mysql --version. 4) Print a short message requesting DB connection details or a path to a dump so I can run SQL. I expect apt-get update and apt-get install to succeed and provide the mysql client binary. After that you should provide the MySQL host/port/user/password/database or provide a SQL dump file path to continue.",
