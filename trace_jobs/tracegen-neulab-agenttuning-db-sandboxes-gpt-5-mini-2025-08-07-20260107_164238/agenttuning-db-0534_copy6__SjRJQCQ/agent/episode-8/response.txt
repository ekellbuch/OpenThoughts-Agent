  "analysis": "So far the container has no MySQL server or client and no database dumps or config files. Previous attempts to show apt-get commands were echoed rather than executed. To be able to run SQL (against a remote MySQL server you provide, or to operate on a local dump you place in the container) we need a mysql client binary here. The next step is to actually install the default MySQL client in this container and verify it's available. After that you must provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or place a SQL dump file in the container and tell me its path so I can run SQL statements.",
  "plan": "1) Run apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) Install the default MySQL client (default-mysql-client) non-interactively. 3) Verify installation with mysql --version and which mysql. 4) Print a prompt asking you to provide MySQL connection details or the path to a SQL dump file. If installation fails due to lack of network or package availability, we'll see error output and then decide next steps.",
