  "analysis": "So far we've determined this container has no MySQL server or client installed: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process was found, mysql client is not present, and there's no /root/.my.cnf. The /app directory is empty. Previous targeted searches under common directories didn't find SQL dumps, DB files, or config files. To proceed I need to search the wider filesystem for any database dumps, config files, or references to MySQL (connection strings, env vars, project configs). If nothing is present, the environment doesn't contain a MySQL database to query and we'll need either an SQL dump file to operate on, or to install/connect to an external MySQL server.",
  "plan": "1) Do a broader filesystem search for common DB/dump/config filenames (.sql, .sql.gz, .db, .sqlite, .cnf, .env, .dump, etc.) to locate any artifacts we could query. 2) Search the filesystem for files that mention 'mysql' (project configs, env files, credentials). 3) Check package managers (dpkg, rpm) to see if MySQL packages are installed but not running. 4) Search again for my.cnf and mysql.sock socket files. Based on results we can either inspect any found dumps/files or decide to install a client or start a server. Each command is chosen to discover any local database artifacts or configuration.",
