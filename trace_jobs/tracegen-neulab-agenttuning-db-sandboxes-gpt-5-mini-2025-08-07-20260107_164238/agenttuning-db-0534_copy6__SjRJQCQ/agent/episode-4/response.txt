  "analysis": "We confirmed there is no MySQL server or client in this container and no database dump or config files to operate on. That means I cannot run any SQL statements locally until either (A) you provide connection details to a reachable MySQL server, (B) you put a SQL dump or database file into the container, or (C) I install a MySQL client (or server) here to connect to an external server or to create/load a database. The container has network/path tools available (apt appears to be usable), so installing a client is feasible if you permit it.",
  "plan": "If you want me to run SQL from inside this container, I'll first install a MySQL client so I can connect to a remote MySQL server or interact with a locally created one. After installing the client I will wait for you to provide the connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or a path to a dump to import. Planned commands:\n1) apt-get update — refresh package lists.\n2) apt-get install -y default-mysql-client — install a MySQL client binary (mysql).\n3) mysql --version — verify installation.\nI will not attempt to connect to any server until you provide connection details or a dump. If you instead prefer I install a server (mysqld) and create/load a database here, tell me and I will proceed with installing a server and creating a database.",
