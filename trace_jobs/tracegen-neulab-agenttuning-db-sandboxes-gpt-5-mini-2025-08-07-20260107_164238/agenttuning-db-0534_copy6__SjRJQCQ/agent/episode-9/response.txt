  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL server or client and no SQL dumps or DB files to operate on. Previous attempts to install the client were only echoed and not executed. To be able to run SQL statements (either against a remote MySQL server you provide or against a local dump you place in the container), we need a mysql client binary available here. Installing the default MySQL client package is the next required step. After installation I will ask you to provide the MySQL connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or to place a SQL dump in the container and tell me its path so I can run single SQL statements as you request.",
  "plan": "1) Run apt-get update to refresh package lists. 2) Install default-mysql-client non-interactively. 3) Verify installation by running mysql --version and which mysql. 4) Print a prompt requesting the DB connection details or the path to a SQL dump so I can proceed to run SQL. I expect apt-get update and install to complete and the mysql binary to be present at /usr/bin/mysql if network access and package repos are available.",
