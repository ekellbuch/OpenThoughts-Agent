The container still likely does not have the MySQL client available. To proceed with running SQL I must install a MySQL client in this environment or you must provide a reachable MySQL server and credentials and confirm the client is present. I'll install the default MySQL client now and verify it's available. After that I'll ask you to provide connection details (host, port, user, password, database) or to place a SQL dump file in the container and tell me its path so I can run queries against it.",

I expect apt-get update/install to complete and provide a working mysql client binary. After that, I will wait for your DB connection details or a dump path before executing any SQL statements.",
