  "analysis": "I inspected the container filesystem and environment. There is no MySQL server or client installed: /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql do not exist, no mysqld process was found, no mysql client binary is present, and no my.cnf or mysql.sock was discovered. The /app directory is empty and a wide filesystem search found no SQL dumps, .env, .cnf, or database files (only /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf was found). Environment variables do not contain DB connection info. In short: there is currently no local MySQL instance or SQL dump to query from within this container.",
  "plan": "I cannot run any SQL until I have a MySQL server to connect to (local or remote) or a SQL dump/file to operate on. Please provide one of the following so I can proceed: 1) the SQL question plus connection details (host, port, user, password, database) for a reachable MySQL server so I can connect and run SQL; 2) a SQL dump or database file placed in the container (or path to it) that I can query; or 3) permission to install a MySQL client (or server) in this container so I can create/load a database and run queries. If you provide connection details I will construct and run a single SQL statement per your instructions. If you want me to install a client now, I'll run apt-get update and install the client and then attempt to connect if you provide credentials.",
