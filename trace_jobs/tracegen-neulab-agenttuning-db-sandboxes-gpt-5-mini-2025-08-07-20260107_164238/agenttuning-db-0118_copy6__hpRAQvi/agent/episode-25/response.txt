  "analysis": "MariaDB (mysqld) is installed and running in the container and the mysql client is available. The server process is running as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket (no password required in this environment).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database question or operation you want performed. When you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern. Examples of queries you can request: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; DESCRIBE <database>.<table>; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>; SELECT * FROM <database>.<table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT 10; CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE statements, etc.",
