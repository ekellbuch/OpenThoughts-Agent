A test query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") previously returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not yet provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or the operation you want performed. When you give the question I will: (1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I will use; (2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown); (3) you will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; (4) I will analyze the output and either produce another single SQL operation or, if finished, give the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and confirm to proceed.",
