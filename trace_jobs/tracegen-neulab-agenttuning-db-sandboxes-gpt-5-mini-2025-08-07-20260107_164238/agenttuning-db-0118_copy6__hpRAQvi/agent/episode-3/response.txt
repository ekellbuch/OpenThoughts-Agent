To be able to execute SQL I need a running MySQL-compatible server (MariaDB or MySQL). I will install a server package (mariadb-server), start it, verify the daemon and socket, and then run a test query (SHOW DATABASES) to confirm connectivity as root (likely via unix_socket).",
  "plan": "1) Install a MariaDB server package so we have a local server to query. 2) Start the mysql/mariadb service. 3) Verify the mysqld process and socket exist. 4) Connect with the mysql client as root and run a simple test query (SHOW DATABASES;) to confirm the server is accepting connections. If the test succeeds, we will be ready to run further SQL statements you request.",
