  "analysis": "The container currently has no MySQL client installed (mysql: command not found) and there are no MySQL processes running. To run SQL against a MySQL server from this shell we need a client binary (mysql) or another method to connect. The next step is to detect the available package manager in the container and install a MySQL-compatible client (default-mysql-client or mariadb-client). After installing the client I'll verify the installation. If the container has no network or package manager, we'll need alternate instructions or credentials to a remote server.",
  "plan": "1) Detect which package manager is available (apt-get, apk, or yum). 2) If apt-get is available, run apt-get update then install default-mysql-client. If apk is available, install mariadb-client. If yum is available, install mariadb. 3) After installation, verify the mysql client with mysql --version. These steps will provide the mysql client so we can run SQL queries in subsequent turns.",
