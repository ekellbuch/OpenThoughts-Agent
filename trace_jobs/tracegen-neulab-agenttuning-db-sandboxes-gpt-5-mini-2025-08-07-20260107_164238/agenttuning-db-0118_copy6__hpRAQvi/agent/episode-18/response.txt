  "analysis": "The container has a working MariaDB server (mysqld) and the mysql client installed. The mysqld process is running as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No other SQL has been executed because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket (no password required in this environment).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database question you want answered (examples: list tables in a database, describe a table, count rows, select rows matching a condition, create/alter/drop objects, etc.). Once you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I'll analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, give the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. Examples of initial exploratory queries I can prepare immediately when you ask: SHOW DATABASES; SHOW TABLES FROM dbname; DESCRIBE dbname.table; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbname.table; SELECT * FROM dbname.table LIMIT 10; etc.",
