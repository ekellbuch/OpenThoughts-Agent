A mysqld process is running as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket (no password required in this environment).",
  "plan": "Please provide the specific database question you want answered (examples: list tables in a database, describe a table, count rows in a table, select rows matching a condition, modify data, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and explain the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement for you to execute, formatted per your rules as:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute only the SQL in the first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output. I will then analyze that output and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nI will not run any SQL until you give the specific question and confirm to proceed.",
