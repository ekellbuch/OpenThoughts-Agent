  "analysis": "Summary of current state: the mysql client was installed, mariadb-server was installed but could not be started via init scripts, so I initialized/started mysqld manually. A mysqld process is running as mysql and the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) succeeded and returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). What has been accomplished: client installed, server started, connectivity verified as root via the unix socket. What still needs to be done: I am ready to run whatever SQL you ask for against this local server; I need your question (the SQL intent). If you want to modify users or expose TCP access, or run multi-step change operations, tell me and I will prepare those SQL statements and run them one at a time.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your question about the database. When you give me the question, I will: 1) explain my understanding and how I'll answer; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required markdown 'Action: Operation' block, single-line SQL) for you to execute; 3) once you provide the query output, I will analyze it and either produce another operation SQL or conclude with an 'Action: Answer' final answer if done. If you want me to run SQL directly from this shell now, tell me the SQL you want executed (or confirm I should run a specific test query).",
