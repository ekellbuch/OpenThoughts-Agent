  "analysis": "The MariaDB server is running inside the container (mysqld process active) and the mysql client is installed. A unix socket exists at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) previously returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the socket. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet, so no further queries have been executed.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question you want answered. When you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and explain the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and return the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. Example queries I can prepare immediately when you ask: list databases, list tables in a database (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;), describe a table (DESCRIBE db.table;), count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;), or select specific rows. Tell me which one you want me to run first.",
