  "analysis": "The container has a working MariaDB server (mysqld) and the mysql client installed. A manual start of mysqld succeeded; the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). No further SQL has been executed because you have not provided a database question or requested an operation yet. The environment is ready to run SQL as root via the unix socket (no password required for socket auth in this environment).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or operation you want performed. When you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I will use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted in the required pattern (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide the next single SQL statement or, if finished, produce the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. Examples of requests you can give: - list all databases; - list tables in a specific database (e.g., show tables from mydb); - count rows in a table; - select rows matching conditions; - create/alter/drop tables or rows. Reminder: I will only provide one SQL statement per turn (in the specified format) and will not run anything until you ask me to operate.",
