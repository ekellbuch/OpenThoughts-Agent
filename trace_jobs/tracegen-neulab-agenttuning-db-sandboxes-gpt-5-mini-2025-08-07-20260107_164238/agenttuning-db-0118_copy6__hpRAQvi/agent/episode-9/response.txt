A manual start of mysqld succeeded; the socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query SHOW DATABASES; returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The environment is ready to run SQL, but you have not yet provided the specific database question or the SQL you want executed.",
  "plan": "I will not run any SQL until you specify the question. Please tell me exactly what you want to do (examples: list databases, list tables in a database, count rows in a table, find rows matching a condition, update or delete rows, create/alter schema, etc.). Once you provide the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the SQL approach; 2) produce a single SQL statement formatted exactly as you required (Action: Operation followed by one-line SQL in a markdown code block) for you to execute; 3) after you run it and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or finish with Action: Answer and the final answer array. If you want me to operate now, state the question and confirm you want me to run the first SQL statement.",
