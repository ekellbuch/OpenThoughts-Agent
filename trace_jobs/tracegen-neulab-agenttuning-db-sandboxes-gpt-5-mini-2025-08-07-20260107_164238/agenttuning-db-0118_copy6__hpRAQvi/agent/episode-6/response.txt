A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) succeeded and returned the default schemas. There is a working unix socket at /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock and the server is reachable as root via the mysql client.

  "plan": "I will wait for your database question. When you provide the question, I will: 1) explain my understanding of the question and how I will solve it; 2) prepare a single SQL statement to run (formatted exactly as you requested, inside an 'Action: Operation' block with a single-line SQL code block in markdown); 3) you will execute that SQL and return the output; 4) I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, produce the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format required. No changes will be made until you give me the question and confirm to proceed.",
