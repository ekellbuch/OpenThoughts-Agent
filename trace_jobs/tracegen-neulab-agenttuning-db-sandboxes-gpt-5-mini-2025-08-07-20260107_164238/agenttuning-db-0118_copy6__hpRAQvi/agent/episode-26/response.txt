A mysqld process is running as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket (no password required in this environment).",

Once you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement for you to execute, formatted as you requested (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown); 3) you will run that single SQL and return the raw MySQL output; 4) I will analyze the output and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, provide the final answer using the exact Action: Answer format. I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and confirm to proceed.",
