  "analysis": "The mysql client has been installed successfully (mysql 8.0.44). There is currently no indication of a running local MySQL server from earlier checks. To run SQL I need connection details: either a running local server/socket, credentials in a client config (~/.my.cnf), or environment variables specifying a remote server. I'll look for a local MySQL socket, MySQL config directory, any saved client credentials, and environment variables that might point to a remote server. Based on what I find I will either connect (and run SQL you request) or ask you for connection details.",
  "plan": "1) Check for a local MySQL socket directory (/var/run/mysqld) which indicates a server is running and where the client can connect via socket. 2) List /etc/mysql to see server config files. 3) Check for a client config file at /root/.my.cnf that may contain credentials. 4) Check environment variables for MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD or similar. These checks will tell us how to connect to the database so I can run your SQL. If I find connection info I'll attempt a test query in the next step.",
