A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) succeeded and returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). The shell is idle and awaiting the next instruction.

  "plan": "Please provide the specific database question you want answered (for example: list tables in a database, count rows in a table, find rows matching a condition, modify data, etc.). Once you give the question I will: 1) explain my understanding and the approach I'll use to answer; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement in the required format (Action: Operation followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL operation or, if done, return the final answer using the exact Action: Answer pattern you specified. I will not run any SQL until you give the question and confirm to proceed.",
