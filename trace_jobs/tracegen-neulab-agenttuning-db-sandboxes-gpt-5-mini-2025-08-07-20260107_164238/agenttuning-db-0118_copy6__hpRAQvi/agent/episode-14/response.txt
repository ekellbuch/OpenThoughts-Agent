The socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) previously returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. The shell is idle and waiting for your next instruction. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the specific database question or the operation you want performed. When you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the output and either provide another single SQL operation or finish with 'Action: Answer' and the final answer array. I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and confirm to proceed.",
