When you provide it I will: 1) explain my understanding of the question and the approach to answer it; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement (in the required format: an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and return the output, I will analyze the result and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. I will not run any SQL until you give the question and confirm to proceed.",
