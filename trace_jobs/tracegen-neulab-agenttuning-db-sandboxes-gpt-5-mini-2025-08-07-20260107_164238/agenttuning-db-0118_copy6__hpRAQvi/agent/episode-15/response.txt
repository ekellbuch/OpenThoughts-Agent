When you provide it I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that single SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. I will not run any SQL until you supply the question and confirm to proceed.",
