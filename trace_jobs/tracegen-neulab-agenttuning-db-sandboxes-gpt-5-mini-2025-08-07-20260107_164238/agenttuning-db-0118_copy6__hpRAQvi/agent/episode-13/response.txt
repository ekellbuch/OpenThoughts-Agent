A mysqld process is running as the 'mysql' user and the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. A test query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys.

  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you provide it I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement for execution, formatted per your rules as:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\n(only one SQL statement per turn, inside the first SQL code block — you will execute that and return the raw MySQL output). After you provide the output I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact required format:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\", \"ANSWER2\", ...]\n\nIf you want me to run an initial exploratory query (e.g., list databases or list tables in a specific database), tell me which query to run and I will prepare the single SQL statement in the required format.",
