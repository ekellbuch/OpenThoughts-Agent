A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) previously returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet, and no further SQL has been executed since the last check.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or the operation you want performed. When you provide the question I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and explain the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown); 3) you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; 4) I will analyze the output and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. Examples you can ask for: list databases, list tables in a specific database (SHOW TABLES FROM dbname;), describe a table (DESCRIBE db.table;), count rows (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db.table;), select rows matching conditions, or modify data. Tell me the exact question or which exploratory query you'd like me to prepare first.",
