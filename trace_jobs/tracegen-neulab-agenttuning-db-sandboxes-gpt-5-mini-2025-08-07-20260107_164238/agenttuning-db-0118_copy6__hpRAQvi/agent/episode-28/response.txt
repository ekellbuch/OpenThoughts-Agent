A mysqld process is running as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been inspected because you have not provided a specific database question yet. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket (no password required in this environment).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database question or the operation you want performed. When you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and confirm to proceed. If you want an initial exploratory query, tell me which one (examples: SHOW DATABASES;, SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;, DESCRIBE <database>.<table>;, SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;).",
