The unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No additional SQL has been executed because you have not provided a specific database question or requested an operation. The environment is ready to run SQL as root via the socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or the exact operation you want performed. When you give the question I will: (1) restate my understanding and describe the SQL approach I'll use; (2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown); (3) you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; (4) I will analyze the output and either produce another single SQL operation or finish with 'Action: Answer' and the final answer array. I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and confirm to proceed.",
