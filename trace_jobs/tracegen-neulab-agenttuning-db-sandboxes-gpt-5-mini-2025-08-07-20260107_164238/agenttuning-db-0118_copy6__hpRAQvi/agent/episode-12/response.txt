The socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys.

  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or the operation you want performed. Once you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted per your rules: an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you paste back the raw MySQL output from that single SQL statement, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer in the exact 'Action: Answer' format you specified. I will not run any SQL until you explicitly provide the question and confirm to proceed.",
