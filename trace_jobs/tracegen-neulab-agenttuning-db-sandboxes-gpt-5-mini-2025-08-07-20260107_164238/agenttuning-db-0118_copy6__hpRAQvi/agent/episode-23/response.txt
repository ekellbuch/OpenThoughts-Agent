The unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) has already returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases/tables have been queried because you have not provided a database question yet. The environment is ready to execute SQL as root via the socket.",
  "plan": "Wait for you to provide the specific database question or the operation you want performed. Once you provide the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and describe the SQL approach; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze it and either issue another single SQL operation or conclude with 'Action: Answer' and the final answer array. I will not run any SQL until you give the question and confirm to proceed.",
