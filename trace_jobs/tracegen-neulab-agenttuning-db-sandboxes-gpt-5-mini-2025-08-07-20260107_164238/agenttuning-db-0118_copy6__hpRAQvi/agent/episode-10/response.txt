A test query (SHOW DATABASES;) ran successfully and returned the default schemas (information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys). There are no further SQL results available because you haven't provided a database question or requested an operation yet.",
  "plan": "I will wait for your specific database question. When you provide it I will: 1) explain my understanding of the question and the SQL approach I'll use to answer it; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement (formatted as you required: an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown) for you to execute; 3) after you run that SQL and paste back the raw MySQL output, I will analyze the output and either provide another single SQL operation or conclude with 'Action: Answer' and the final answer array. I will not run any SQL until you give the question and confirm to proceed.",
