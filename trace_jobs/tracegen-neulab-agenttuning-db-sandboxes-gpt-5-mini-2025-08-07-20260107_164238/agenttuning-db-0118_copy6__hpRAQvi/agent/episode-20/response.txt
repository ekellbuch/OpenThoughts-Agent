A mysqld process is running as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (SHOW DATABASES;) successfully returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No specific database question or SQL operation has been provided yet, so no further SQL has been executed. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket.",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the exact database question you want answered (examples: list tables in a database, describe a table, count rows, select rows matching a condition, modify data, create/alter/drop objects, etc.). When you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding and explain the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown); 3) you will execute that SQL and return the raw MySQL output; 4) I will analyze the output and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' pattern you specified. I will not run any SQL until you provide the question and confirm to proceed.",
