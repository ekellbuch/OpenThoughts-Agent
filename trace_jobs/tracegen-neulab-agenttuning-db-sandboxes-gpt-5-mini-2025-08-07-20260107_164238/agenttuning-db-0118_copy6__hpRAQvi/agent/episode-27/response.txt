The server process is active as user 'mysql', the unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists, and a test query (mysql -u root -e \"SHOW DATABASES;\") returned the default schemas: information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, sys. No application-specific databases or tables have been queried because you have not yet provided a specific database question. The environment is ready to accept SQL statements as root via the unix socket (no password required in this environment).",
  "plan": "I will wait for you to provide the specific database question or operation you want performed. When you provide it I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and describe the SQL approach I'll use; 2) produce exactly one SQL statement formatted as you requested (an 'Action: Operation' line followed by a single-line SQL code block in markdown); 3) you will execute only the SQL in that first SQL code block and return the raw MySQL output; 4) I will analyze that output and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact 'Action: Answer' format. I will not run any SQL or make changes until you give the question and confirm to proceed.",
