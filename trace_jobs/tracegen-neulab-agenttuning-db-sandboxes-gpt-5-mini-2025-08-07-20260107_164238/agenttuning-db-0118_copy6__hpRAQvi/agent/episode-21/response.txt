Once you give the question I will: 1) restate my understanding of the question and explain the SQL approach I'll use; 2) provide exactly one SQL statement formatted per your rules in the form:\n\nAction: Operation\n```sql\n<single-line SQL statement>;\n```\n\nYou will execute that statement and return the raw MySQL output; I will analyze it and either provide another single SQL operation or, if finished, return the final answer using the exact required pattern:\n\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [\"ANSWER1\",\"ANSWER2\",...]\n\nTell me which query you'd like me to prepare first (for example: SHOW TABLES FROM <database>; or SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <database>.<table>;).",
