# marin (marin-community/marin) — repo facts & accepted practices

The main marin monorepo (JAX/Levanter training, the artifact/execution system, eval, tooling). Local clone =
ground truth at `/Users/benjaminfeuer/Documents/marin`. Related docs: `marin-executor/` (the retired
Executor → lazy `ArtifactStep`/`Artifact` system, post-#6649), `marinskyrl/` (the SkyRL RL fork),
`levanter/` (the JAX training engine).

## Publish a permanent research artifact as a static webpage (PR #6816 + #7084)

The sanctioned marin mechanism for a **durable public URL** to a permanent, shareable, code-fetchable static
webpage (analysis site, results dashboard, paper-companion page, self-contained HTML report).

**Mechanism:** `marin.publish.sites.publish_site()` (module `lib/marin/src/marin/publish/sites.py`) + the CLI
wrapper `scripts/ops/publish_site.py`. Uploads a single HTML file OR a multi-file directory (SPA — preserves
relative paths; the dir must contain `index.html`) to a public GCS bucket and registers it for discovery.

**Canonical invocation (CLI):**
```bash
cd <marin repo>
uv run scripts/ops/publish_site.py <report.html | ./site_dir/> \
    --user  <author-handle>       # lowercase-kebab namespace, e.g. penfever
    --slug  <site-slug>           # lowercase-kebab project id, e.g. moe-sharding-grid
    --version <YYYY.MM.DD[.N]>     # CalVer, e.g. 2026.07.10  (.N to disambiguate same-day)
    --title "Human Readable Title" # REQUIRED — shown in the discovery index
    --summary "one-line description"   # optional
```
**Python:** `from marin.publish.sites import publish_site; site = publish_site(source, user=…, slug=…,
version=…, title=…, summary="")` → `site.path` = the `gs://` dir.

**Where it lands / the public URL** (deterministic, address-by-convention — no separate registry lookup):
- Object: `gs://marin-public/<user>/<slug>/<version>/index.html` (+ a sibling `.artifact.json` record).
- **Public URL:** `https://storage.googleapis.com/marin-public/<user>/<slug>/<version>/index.html` (served
  `text/html`). Constants in `sites.py`: `PUBLIC_BUCKET="marin-public"`,
  `PUBLIC_URL_BASE="https://storage.googleapis.com/marin-public"`.
- Helpers: `site_uri(user, slug, version)` → the `gs://` dir; `site_url(user, slug, version)` → the public URL;
  `site_name(user, slug)` → the record name (`sites/<user>/<slug>`).

**Discovery + code-fetch:**
- Every publish upserts an entry `{name, version, url, title, summary}` into the central index
  `gs://marin-public/index.json` (a list — read it to enumerate all published sites).
- Fetch a published artifact back in code by its deterministic address: `Artifact.raw_load(site_uri(user,
  slug, version))` — no registry dependency.

**⚠ Gotchas / constraints:**
- **Last-writer-wins:** there is NO immutability guard — republishing the SAME `<user>/<slug>/<version>`
  overwrites. **Bump the `--version` (CalVer) to keep an immutable prior copy.** Treat a published version as
  frozen; new results → new version.
- **`index.json` is non-atomic** (read-modify-write) — avoid concurrent publishes racing the same index.
- **Use origin/main:** the Content-Type fix ("write site objects via `fs.open` so Content-Type sticks",
  PR #7084) landed AFTER the initial #6816 — pull recent `main` or pages may serve with the wrong MIME type.
- **Not everything is publishable:** `render_cluster_report` was deliberately NOT migrated (it can contain
  copyrighted corpus text) — do not publish raw corpus/eval text this way without a copyright check.
- **Requires** the marin repo env + GCS write auth to `gs://marin-public` (public-read bucket).

## Execution & artifacts — the ArtifactStep system (authority: `marin-executor/`)

marin's pipeline/execution layer, and the substrate the publish mechanism above rides on. **The eager
content-addressed `Executor` + `ExecutorStep` are RETIRED (PR #6649)** — replaced by lazy typed
**`ArtifactStep`**s (`marin.execution.lazy`): explicit **`name@version`** (CALVER) addressing instead of an
md5-of-the-config-tree, typed **`Artifact`** outputs (`LevanterCheckpoint`, `TokenizedCache`, …), with identity
(`build_config(ctx)`, pure over a `StepContext`) separated from execution (compute rides `remote(fn,
resources=…)`, not the graph node).

**Full detail lives in `.claude/projects/marin-executor/marin-executor.md`** — read it for:
- the retirement + the `ArtifactStep`/`remote(...)`/`name@version` migration model;
- the surviving **`StepRunner` distributed-lock SPMD deadlock (#7080)** and the sanctioned workaround — a direct
  `srun` launch via **`LevanterSlurmCluster`** (marin's first-class SLURM path; NOT a hack), i.e. ArtifactStep =
  identity/graph layer, `srun` = execution layer on non-Fray clusters;
- the legacy GCS `.executor_info` layout still used to recover OLD executor-launched runs (Delphi midtrains).

`publish_site` records each page as a typed `Artifact`, so a published site is code-fetchable by its
deterministic address via `Artifact.raw_load(site_uri(user, slug, version))` — the *same* typed-artifact system,
no separate registry lookup.
